"My family. I had a family of four siblings, two older sisters. My brother, who was eleven years older than me, and then me. And there was kind of a dichotomy in the household. The two older sisters, they were accomplished, very beautiful. And they were in their own world. And I was sickly and a bookworm. Stayed at home all the time. And the only person there for me was my brother. And even though he was eleven years old, he always made time for me. And he did things with me every Saturday afternoon at the matinee on TV. We\'d watch The Three Stooges. And we\'d watch horror movies, those old Universal Horror movies. And he just made me feel special. And the song that reminds me of him most is ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" because when I was nine years old, I attended his high school graduation. And no, I was seven years old. I\'m sorry. I attended his graduation. And when he stepped off stage, he received his diploma. And then he received a notice from the army recruiter that he was drafted to go to Vietnam. So the song by Peter, Paul, and Mary, ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"", became the song my mother and I would always listen to and think of him. And it just was very poignant and it meant a lot. And it was just I was bullied and a very sad child. And he brought sunshine to my life and spent time with me and loved me. So I felt very happy. But that song my mother and I would always cry. So anyway, that was my first story to introduce you and to tell you a little bit about me. Fortunately, I\'m a lot better but I just wanted to tell you that song means a lot to me and my brother meant a lot. So thank you for letting me share.","I grew up in Nanjing, China. When I was a baby, I lost my right leg in a fire. Shortly after that, I was abandoned on the street. I was found at a year and a half old and taken to the local government orphanage. Fortunately for me, I was adopted when I was seven years old and came here to the states.

When I was 14 years old, I received a running prosthetic. The day that I ran, I remember it being one of the most traumatizing days of my whole life. That was the first time that I was gonna have to be out. I was gonna have to show people that this is who I am, that I couldn't hide, that I was an amputee.

I got out there and I started running and I realized I love to do this. This is so liberating. This is so freeing because I am out and this is who I am.

I don't think you ever get one moment, have one experience, and you totally accept everything about who you are. That's a lifelong journey. But the start of that is finding something that allows you to be you.",5,377,230
"Well, I\'m going to tell you since my last story was kind of modeling, I will tell you a funny story. Well, my husband and I lived in Florida for quite some time. And we were on the beach. And there was a brand of suntan lotion that I had used before. They use it a lot in tanning salons, but it\'s also a really good suntanning lotion. So I grabbed it because I think it was like 15 or 18 SPF that we used all the time. And that day, I grabbed it. We put it on. We stayed out from about 10:00 a.m. We broke for lunch around noon and then remained out for another 3 hours. So we didn\'t eat that day on the beach and we stopped at a restaurant that we knew on the way home. And we noticed people looking at us really strangely. So I looked at him. He looked at me. We were still kind of sunblind from being out in the sun so long. So he looked behind me. I looked behind him so we couldn\'t figure it out. So we said, ""I said, I\'m going to go to the restroom and see if I look funny or anything."" And he said, ""Me too."" So the bathrooms were right next to each other. So I looked in the mirror and I said, ""Oh, my God."" And I heard from the other bathroom him exclaimed the same thing, ""Oh my God."" And what had happened is I had grabbed tanning accelerator instead of tanning lotion, and we were as red as lobsters. So long story short, if you are going to be in the Gulf of Mexico suntanning, you should make sure you\'re using proper suntanning lotion. Okay? That\'s it.","We were rolling around selling tee shirts, and we did that for five years. Along the way, we learned some things about what people liked and didn't like on shirts, but we weren't making a lot of money at all, just getting by. So we had decided that our label and our brand name was going to be something that already existed in people's minds in some way. ""Life is good"" was one of about 50 different slogans we put on an easel. 

In the morning, we woke up and we tore ""Life is good"" off the page, and we Scotch taped it up on the wall. And then we stepped back and we said, ""Okay, now it's not just for artists, this is for anyone who sees the glass half full."" 

Life goes by pretty quickly, and you have to think about when you're old and gray. What will make you happy to look back and say, ""You did it""? What will be fulfilling? You gotta think through and say, what would be meaningful in my life?",4,350,214
"Okay. I was married when I was young, and unfortunately, my first husband had a heart attack at a young age. And I had two young children to take care of. I hadn\'t dated or been out with anybody for years. My children were growing up - my son was in college and my daughter was 16. And she decided that she liked heavy music, so she wanted to go to Ozzfest in Georgia. So, a friend of hers, the mother, and I drove them to Atlanta. And we went to Ozzfest.\n\nI was getting something to drink for the mother, the other mother, and myself. And I was standing there, and I saw this man with the most beautiful hair I\'d ever seen. It was really long and just beautiful, thick, and beautiful. And I told him, ""You have the most beautiful hair of anyone I\'ve ever seen. Excuse me."" And he said, ""Well, thank you."" And, ""You look like you totally don\'t belong here."" So, I said I laughed, and we talked a little more. And I went and sat back down. And a little while later, I happened to look on one of the stages, and I saw him on stage performing with this band. I didn\'t even know he was a musician. And after the set, he came up to me and he said, ""Do you have an email?"" And I gave him my email address. And we started corresponding. And I married him two years later. And he\'s my current husband. And it was a really strange day, but it was one of the happiest days of my life. So, that\'s how I met my husband. He was playing at Ozzfest.","I have been dating Michelle for nearly three years. In June, we went to Rome, Italy for a week-long vacation she had booked for us. It was a trip of a lifetime for me as I had rarely traveled anywhere outside of the United States. We left Dallas and flew to London for a 6-hour layover. It was long enough where we could leave the airport and experience a little of the area before flying on to Rome.

After a few days in Rome touring all of the sites I had only read about, we had dinner at an extremely fancy restaurant. It was there that my life changed for the better. I was widowed about ten years ago, and I didn't think I would ever marry again. Much to my surprise, Michelle proposed to me. I know it isn't the traditional way this was supposed to work, but I was floored.

My heart and mind were racing that I don't even remember saying yes, but she said I accepted right away. The look on her face made me the happiest man in the world. I truly believe we were destined to be together, but it took me some nudging to make me realize it for real.

For the rest of the trip, I was walking on air. I have finally found happiness in my life again. I felt like the luckiest person on earth.",3,346,263
"So yeah. So, I can share a story that happened recently. So, I went to Yosemite with my boyfriend two weeks ago. We went to see one of the biggest meteor showers during the year, and that was very fascinating. That was really my first time seeing so many meteors at one time. And then, however, a part of the sky was covered by clouds, so we couldn't see meteors throughout all the areas in the sky, but at least through a specific small area we have seen a lot of meteors, so I was pretty satisfied. And I was also very grateful for my boyfriend. He woke up so early at 3:00 a.m. and drove us up to the Glacier Point in Yosemite to catch the sunrise, which is very beautiful, although I was still sleeping all the way while he was driving. And then afterwards, we went on a little hike to the Mirror Lake. However, once we got to the Mirror Lake, it started to rain. So then the Mirror Lake was supposed to be very smooth on its surface so that it looks like a mirror. But because of the raining, the mirror was kind of rough. So it was a numb mirror, Mirror Lake. But we still got a little exercise by hiking towards it. So it was still very fun. And after that, we went home. That was a pretty fun trip. I want to share with you.","My wife and I traveled to Italy and did an amazing hike in the Dolomite mountain range. I had wanted to do this hike for many years and had researched it quite a bit. I knew it was going to be difficult, but I had no idea how much so. We started early in the morning, and for about four hours, we just kept climbing up higher and higher. It was even more difficult because there were loose rocks under us for much of it.

Every time we reached what we thought was the top, another long uphill awaited us. Finally, after what I figured was another false top, we came up, and it was as though we were at the top of the world. There below us, spreading for 360 degrees, were what seemed like thousands of craggy mountain peaks. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. We both started to cry; it was so beautiful.

There was more crazy hiking to do, however, as we had to use ropes that had been attached to the mountain during World War I to traverse some cliffs and small waterfalls. That was the most difficult part for my wife, and I was so proud of her that she did it. I think she surprised herself.

It was really one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. Even though we pretty much killed ourselves doing it, I think we would both do the same hike again in a heartbeat.",3,279,279
"So I\'d like to tell a story about how I really got interested in robotics. There was this moment when I was in a Lego Robotics competition where I first realized that all robotics has the ability to help people. And even if the project that I came up with was super dumb back then, and it was absolutely not realistic at all, the fact that I realized that it could help is kind of what kept me going. So then in high school, I continued to do robotics. I continued to do outreach for robotics, to get people to get the same kind of insight on, like, ""Oh, I could actually do stuff with this."" And even now, I\'m still following that same passion for how robots can help people. And I\'m still doing it now.","I started off in physics, electrical engineering. I got my masters in biomedical engineering. Then I started a construction company. And that was just a result of buying a house I could afford in my 20s, which was really broken down and needed a lot of work. And so I worked on it, and I loved that. I found I had a real passion for construction. So then I was trying to reconcile, construction biomedical engineering, not quite sure how that works together.

All of that stopped completely when I had gotten married, and I had a baby three months early with cerebral palsy. He's now 11, so I realized as I was going to physical therapy with my son, I was getting so frustrated looking for things that were really gonna help my son. So we pulled together a team and created a device that I thought was going to help my son. It's a little wearable sensor.

And my company, Dynofit, that's what we have now. It's amazing, life is long, and you really have the opportunity to do a lot of different things. I don't really define myself as, ""I'm a this"" or ""I'm a that"". I'm a lot of things, we all are.",2,157,249
"Guys, so today I was watching an episode of Suits, and in Suits, there is a lawyer named Louis. The whole thing is a TV show that takes place in New York, in a law office. Louis is one of the lawyers who is constantly trying to be the best, and he always sees himself as inferior to Harvey, another character. And every time Louis tries to do some kind of payback for whatever Harvey did to him, it always ends up backfiring on him somehow. He always makes a bigger mess than what he started. What kind of resonated with me in this story is that it's not necessarily the greatest objective to try and be the best. Because if you are trying to be better than someone else, you're constantly competing and trying to undermine them or go against them. And while it can be healthy, to some extent, to have some competition, unhealthy competition doesn't make a lot of sense, and that kind of resonated with me. Because for so long, I competed in competitions for everything from math to science to robotics. And it was always like you had to be the best. And now, going past college, it doesn't make sense to try and be the best because everyone is doing something completely different from you. So just keep trying and undermining people will just backfire on you.","Growing up with just my dad and my brother, I was obviously very independent and strong-willed. My dad's best friend was a stockbroker, and for some reason, because I was so good with money, I decided that I would be a really good stockbroker. And fortunately, throughout high school, we had work exchange and work experience, and they used to send me off with all sorts of random checks and things to deliver somewhere, and I had no idea where I was going or how to get there.

And being the little surfy chick that I was, it just made me realize that wasn't the avenue I wanted to go down. Ultimately, to become successful in anything, you have to be relatively selfish. You have to be so one-dimensional.

I also believe that there's no such thing as a mistake; it's only a learning experience. The only mistake is not learning from it. But even then, you're just gonna be given the opportunity to learn it and learn it and learn it until such time as you do. So I made the same ""mistake"" over and over again until I actually got the lesson.",2,264,225
"So the play that I mentioned earlier, in the play, I take the role of a child who is really annoyed at having to do a service project, which is basically serving some burritos to a homeless population, and just really annoyed and frustrated and worried about my own material comforts. And then I realized that the homeless people can overhear me, and then I become super embarrassed and realize the fact that I can't really say bad things. I'm not supposed to say bad things about people because people might be hearing, and that wouldn't be very nice. And this kind of resonated with me because sometimes I do do things like that. Maybe not to that extent, but I don't want to load the dishwasher because I'm tired, but I need to load the dishwasher because maybe my mom is tired as well, and her arm is hurting, and therefore she can't do it. So I should probably help out. And it kind of just made me realize that, yes, sometimes I can be selfish, and I should be aware of that and not do that as often.","On Thanksgiving Day—that's the only day my parents would take me out to dinner—there was this woman going through a garbage can, with her little daughter, about three or four years old, picking out her Thanksgiving dinner out of a garbage can. At that point in my life, I began to think, it's not as good on this planet as I think it might be.

One of the things I wanted to do when I grew up was to try to make the world a better place. But I didn't have an awful lot of confidence getting there. Because as a Puerto Rican kid in New York, going to some terrible schools, nobody ever told me as a kid that I could really amount to much at all.

But finally, I met someone who helped me, and I was able to make the leap. And then, when I got into college and met some professors that had some faith in me and encouraged me to go to graduate school and so on and so forth, I always pointed my life in that direction.",5,216,204
"I'm going to share something about work today. So, I've been doing an internship. It ends on this Friday. As part of the internship, my project has been basically to render a component on the page. And I spent probably six, seven, eight, probably eight weeks of my twelve-week internship trying to get this thing to render on the page. And I've tried multiple different things on, how do I get this to work? Everything from giving it the bare minimum to giving it almost everything it could possibly take. And it still doesn't work. And I guess in this case, good enough is much better than perfect because there is no way I would have been able to finish this project in twelve weeks. And I recognize that now. And it was frustrating at times. But understanding that I did enough work so that someone else can pick it up and continue is pretty okay with me. I'm okay with the fact that good enough is much better than perfect. And this kind of reflects in other aspects, too, right? Yeah, you could sit there and polish every single tile in your floor to a mirror sheen, but also you're spending so much time on something that you could be spending on doing something else. So you might spend, like, 12 hours on the floor and not touch anything else. And that's kind of a waste, honestly. So good enough is better than perfect.","Engineering was exciting to me because it was the creation process of going from an idea to ""I've made this"" or ""this is a better way of doing it.""

We opened up the directory of industrial designers, and we just started cold calling down the list to try to get interviews. We had just graduated from college, so we didn't really know anything about their daily work, so we just asked them to tell us, ""So what do you do? Show us where you work. What kind of projects are you working on? What are the problems?""

And one of the patterns was people had a hard time finding new materials, finding suppliers, finding how to use it, finding what the options are. It's a whole can of worms that they just didn't know how to do.

I really wanted to realize my maximum potential, and I felt if I just took a job somewhere, then I wouldn't be able to realize it. It would just be whatever they gave you to do.

Today, if you want to build something, the barriers to try are very low. And it really comes back to effort and desire.",2,284,230
"So, I guess here, the fact is, I'm not a huge fan of the work that I had to do in this past year for my research. It wasn't what I really wanted to do, but I did it anyway because I was being paid to do it. And now I'm almost done. I've switched over to a new strain of work that I am interested in, but I still have to wrap up the last bits of my old work by writing a paper. And I really can't find any of the motivation to do it because I did not like the work at all. But this is the only way to prove that I did any work in the entirety of the last year. So, I guess, the main thing I'm learning here is, there is a challenge there. I don't want to work on it. I have no motivation to work on it, but I need to get it done. So if anything, I'm kind of completing it out of spite. And it seems that spite is a pretty good reason to keep going because it's just to prove someone else wrong. That thought that you couldn't. I'm taking it as motivation to do something I really am not motivated to do: to prove others that I was wrong. Prove others that they were wrong about me.","I spent 17 years at IBM right out of school, and I didn't take responsibility or any initiative regarding my career, and that was a big mistake. But finally, I got tired of it, so I started taking control of my career. That really helped; I got myself a job at Charles Schwab and got moved out here.

But towards the end of my time at Schwab, I started this little hobby: Craigslist. The initial idea was just that I would send friends, maybe 10 or 12, notices about what I thought were cool events. Then people started making suggestions of new categories like jobs, and it just keeps growing.

And by the end of '98, that's when I decided it was time to make it a real company.",1,266,149
"So, back in elementary school, I switched schools in third grade. I was put in a class with a group of people, and I had the same people in my class through fifth grade. The group of friends that I made there continued on through high school. And when we got to the college admissions process, when we were applying to colleges, a lot of them became super competitive. I'm still unsure as to the reason why they chose to become super competitive about it, but my decision was to not discuss my colleges with any of them because I didn't want people feeling bad about the decisions I made. I didn't want to share because I felt like that was more of a private thing to discuss with my family and not with my friends. For some reason, they took offense and to the point where, when I finally announced my college decision, they got really mad and they were nonchalant about it. It made me realize that even though I've had these friends for so long, they probably weren't really good friends to begin with. So I learned to let go of them and I cut contact with almost all of them now. And I'm a lot happier for it as a result.","""You are so smart."" That phrase has been told to me since I was a kid. I felt special when I was told this, so I did everything I could to get that phrase told to me by my peers, parents, and teachers. I even got into college with a pretty big scholarship.

But now that I am in my second year of college, I am massively struggling as I now see that my crutches, in the form of extra credit and scheduling that was given to me, caring teachers, are gone. I stay up late, doing homework, studying, trying to remember the information that I understand but can't retain, but it's not enough to pass tests that were supposed to be easy.

I feel like I was never that smart, just lucky. The little voice in the back of my head is telling me that everything that I have built up over the years should just be burned down, that I don't deserve to be in college. I should just let myself flunk out and let my family, friends, and everyone see me as what I am, an idiot who got a bit of luck and doesn't deserve the praise she got over the years.",1,241,237
"So today was my friend, well, it wasn't my friend's birthday. It was two days before her birthday, but we decided to celebrate. So we went to this restaurant, and the restaurant was in Watertown. And I don't know if you know this, you probably don't, but Watertown is far away. So I had prepared a present for my friend. I got her this plant for her fish that she can grow and then her fish can hide in it and really enjoy it. And yeah, so I got this present prepared. It, and then I was like on my way to Watertown, taking the bus. And I was like super grumpy feeling about it because I just felt like tired and I had to rush. And then I missed my bus. And so I was just like, wait, this will probably be fun, but I'm just tired. Kind of annoyed, kind of like that. And then so I arrived there, got there right on time. I saw two of my other friends who I haven't seen in a while. And so we went into the restaurant. And my one friend was telling us about how she almost got into a car accident on her way here from New Jersey. And then the birthday girl arrived. And I gave her her present and she opened it and she really liked it because she loves her fish. And so she's really excited for it, for him. And yeah, then we got Indian food and we got like a lot of food. So I have leftovers now. And we just kind of spent the time laughing and chatting and catching up. It was kind of like old times because we're all College friends. And so it just reminds me of those College days or kind of tired and chaotic and really having, I don't know, just generally a lot of fun then. I rode back with my friend, the one who almost got in the car accident, to the train station. And I came back here and I practiced violin. And so yeah, I feel like I've got a lot done today, had fun, met up with people and I feel really good now.","My aunt called me a few weeks ago and wanted me to go with her on a road trip. It was kind of unexpected, but I haven't seen her much in the last few years, so I was excited. We were headed to a wedding about 6 hours away. I didn't really know the guy getting married, but I had met his mom a few times.

On the way to the wedding, we stopped to visit several relatives. Again, people I hadn't seen in years. It was so fun to catch up with all my cousins! We had a blast at the wedding, or rather, the wedding reception and dance! Now, that was a good time. Everyone was out on the dance floor, and most of them were very good dancers. My aunt and I didn't participate in that, but it sure was fun watching everybody out there. The food was good too!

After the dance, we headed back to another friend's house to spend the night. I had met him a few times before, and we spent a couple of enjoyable days with him. We spent a few more days visiting with more friends and relatives before we headed back.

I absolutely had a blast. We talked all the way there and back, which was about a 12-hour round trip. This is my favorite aunt of all time, and I'm so glad she asked me to go with her. She is over 70 now and doesn't get around as well as she used to, so I soaked in every moment of our time together.

I only wish it could've lasted longer, but unfortunately, I had to get back to work. I hope we get the opportunity to do another road trip together!",4,432,339
"Yeah. So my sister is writing this story, and the preliminary title, or the current title, is ""Wonders for the Dead."" And it\'s a really interesting story. Her and I had talked about it and kind of brainstormed together because it\'s based off the idea of Christian missionaries. But it\'s trying to take an ethical perspective or like a thoughtful perspective on the idea of someone being a missionary and bringing the idea of like, why would someone want to be a missionary? And so I read this story today to offer some edits or some critiques. And basically, the story goes, it starts out this little girl named Annalore is on a train with her mother and her two siblings. And they are traveling from, we don\'t know exactly where, but they\'re going to a citadel. And then the train stops because they need to do some train work. And they see three undead, or how they\'re called, dead. Three of the dead behind or like the little girl sees three of the dead and they\'re wearing ragged clothes. And she asks her mother, like, ""mama, is that one of the dead?"" And her mother\'s trying to sleep, so her mother tells her like, ""Be quiet, leave me alone."" But then the dead, they race for the train, they jump into the train, and they\'re trying to find somebody to bite or somebody to eat. And then they get in, everyone\'s panicking, there\'s like a stampede. The main character was in the woman\'s train compartment and all the men run into that compartment. And they\'re hiding, they\'re trying to get away from this, obviously slam his door closed. And then there\'s just this little boy and this old man who are left there with the dead chasing them. And so the little boy manages to open a window and jumps out the window, and the old man is waving his cane at the dead, trying to get out, trying to escape. He looks back to see that the little boy\'s opened the window and then they grab him and they start biting him, ripping him to pieces. And the whole time the little girl is just watching. And like her mother told her, stay still, sit, don\'t look. And so the whole time she\'s just watching because her mother can\'t pay attention to that with everything going on. So she sees this man get killed very violently. But then the train workers come and they have guns, and they\'re like, ""you better leave this train or else we\'re going to blow you to Kingdom Come."" And so then the dead, one of them says, ""You should be scared of me. What are you doing?"" But the train records, once again, are like, ""we\'ll shoot you if you don\'t leave."" So then finally they leave, they drag the body of the old man away with them, and the girl is horrified at thinking about what she saw. And so then, flash forward, maybe like ten years later, and she\'s trying to buy a gun in the store. And the store owner asks her, like, ""Is this gun for your father?"" She tells him, ""no, this is not for my father."" He\'s, like, ""Are you sure?"" She\'s like, ""yes, because my father looks for all of his women folk, or like the women connected to him, to be well armed and taken care of."" So eventually the store owner decides, like, ""okay, fine, I\'ll sell you the gun."" And he had tried to sell her, like, a really bad gun that wasn\'t working very well because he thought as a woman that she wouldn\'t know. But she instantly knew. And so then she takes her gun, she gets all of the materials that she needs for her father, for his store. She takes it over there. And then the store clerk is kind of flirting with her, like, ""oh, you don\'t have to call me Mr. Gibson or whatever his name is. You can call me by my first name."" And she\'s like, ""that would be inappropriate."" And he\'s like, ""but is there a way that we could be close?"" And she\'s like, ""sure, whatever."" And she leaves. She runs out because she\'s like, ""I need to go and check the mail. Like, I\'m waiting for a package or a letter."" Until she gets there and the mail is late. And so everybody starts freaking out. They\'re like, ""Did the dead attack the train?"" And the Sheriff\'s like, ""no, the dead haven\'t attacked our train in ages, it\'s fine."" And she\'s like, ""yeah, but he doesn\'t know about me being attacked by the dead that time, like, ten years ago."" So finally, the mail compartment arrives, and everybody\'s excited. They raise the man, and they ask him, like, ""Wait, did the dead attack the train? It\'s all right, it\'s late."" And he\'s just, like, frozen and speechless, holding these packages. And they\'re like, ""Wait, he\'s one of the dead!"" And they start freaking out, they start panicking. And then the girl fires her rifle into the air, and she\'s like, ""you need to calm down. Like, he\'s not one of the dead. He doesn\'t have any of the signs of the dead."" And so then she goes up to the guide, she\'s like, ""okay, do you have my package from blah, blah, blah, this other city?"" And he\'s like, ""yeah, I do."" He gives it to her. And she\'s like, ""okay,"" because she\'s waiting for this response to find out if she can become a part of the lazari to help deal with the dead. And so that\'s the beginning of the story. And I thought it was a pretty interesting story. So you can tell me what you think.","I wanted to be an artist when I was in high school, but I actually started in nursing school. We were really poor, and my dad died when I was six, and I saw my mom struggle working in a sewing factory. I thought, well, this is crazy to be a starving artist. I better do something practical. So I went to school for nursing.

Photography and me was a better fit. So, I started at the Miami Herald as a staff photographer, just from there moved on to do international stories, so I bounced around a lot. I traveled a whole lot.

When you can capture a moment, capture history, preserve that second of time, that's meaningful in some way. If it makes you feel, it's probably gonna make someone else feel too. But those were the moments that I always look for. I feel like there are all different types of photography that you have to appreciate.

You can do all these stylized, beautiful, perfectly composed pictures, but for me, journalism, I think the only thing that matters is the content in the moment and making someone feel. Because you can make someone think, but to make someone feel is the ultimate goal.

The more you can do to connect people, the less hatred there will be in the world, the more understanding there will be.",2,1235,266
"So yeah, so over the weekend, I not only went to get the furniture, but I also went to get some oven mitts. And it was just a really nice experience overall because I got them from Buy Nothing, which is like a site or a group on Facebook to find free things. And so, I got these oven mitts. But then the lady and I were communicating a lot. She wanted one of the candles that I was giving away. And I wanted the mitts. So, I was able to take her the candle. And she left me the mitts. And she really enjoyed the smell of the candle and stuff. We had a really nice and sweet interaction.","There's this woman that goes around town who sells beauty products, clothes, cleaning products, small appliances, and pretty much anything a small business can offer. I was paying for the product I bought from her, and she just randomly said I looked good in my leggings and I looked long-legged. 

For someone who's been bullied throughout my childhood for how I looked, this made my heart flutter. She just gave me the confidence to wear leggings out in public.",4,136,91
"Yeah. So, for today, it\'s a quick story. I have been pretty tired today because I was traveling over the weekend. But going to see my friend and have some fun. And then I got back and didn\'t really have too much time to rest because I had to go to work and there\'s just been a lot of stuff going on at work. And I said, ""Because I\'ve been tired,"" it\'s been extra stressful doing those things.","I work in the event industry, and Covid did its number on us, but restrictions are finally loosened enough for us to do our job the way we used to. Half my body hurts. I'm definitely not getting enough sleep, and won't have a day off that I can actually spend on my couch for the next 2 weeks.

This sounds bad, but it's exactly what I need right now. Having fun work days with my colleagues, who are equally as crazy as I am, doing a job I enjoy, and feeling my sore muscles when I'm back home. My mental health has gotten so much better in the past two weeks.

Before that, I was touring with a couple of folks who made me feel unwelcome, and I constantly felt like no matter what I was doing, it wasn't enough. I did overestimate my skill and took over responsibilities I wasn't ready for, so their frustration is understandable, but it still took its toll on my mental health. Hard work isn't nearly as much fun if it's not appreciated.

Luckily, I'm back, and everything's gotten better. I randomly smile. I want to remember the day when I go to bed instead of hoping I'd forget it soon. I look forward to tomorrow instead of dreading it, and I actually feel happy. This hasn't happened in a long time.",4,94,270
"Yeah, so I think something I\'ve been thinking about lately is this book that I\'ve been reading. It\'s called ""The Way of the Wanderer,"" and basically, it\'s about a war between, I think, ten dogs. And one of the gods is the wandering God. And another god is the God of Law. And the God of Law is trying to become the only God. So, he wants to be the law. And the wandering God wants to prevent that because obviously, the wanderer doesn\'t want to be free. And so, to prevent the God of Law from becoming the only God or the ruling God, the wandering God starts uniting the tribes of people that worship him, and then also working with other gods to try and, I guess, combine their worshippers. They will be stronger than the God of Law. And so currently, in the part of the book that I\'m reading, there are these genies or one particular genie who is determined that he wants to be the best genie and the smartest. And he wants to be honored by the wandering God. And so basically, he\'s playing both sides. He\'s playing all sides to try and impress the wandering God. He\'s pitting tribe leaders against each other to try and eventually make it look like he brought everyone together. And he is trying to work with other deities, other spirits from other gods. But in the end, he\'s not that smart. And so, I think that his plans are going to fail in one way or another. But then, I also do wonder if they will, in some way, succeed because they\'re so messy that they might actually end up being good.","I grew up in Nigeria. But we came from a very entrepreneurial family. And that meant that people were doers. And I believe in life, that you actually have the capacity to do whatever it is you want to do. Nobody else is going to do it.

There are so many things you see in life that you feel like there's injustice. But oftentimes you just relax and say somebody else is gonna do it. Well, that somebody else is you. And you seem very controlled about your own life and very driven. So I'm wondering, was there a time when you were less sure about yourself?

Yes. Okay. Oh yeah. Tell me about that. Computer scientists know, nothing ever works the first time, that's the beauty of it. It's a problem-solving thing, and so failure is built into the act of learning. You have to, like, trip and trip and trip and trip.

And then, once you figure out all the ways you can trip, you finally learn how to walk. It's little baby steps to build that muscle of courage and confidence. Just take a deep breath, and just tell your feet to move, and your feet will move.",3,336,239
"So today, I had a dream and it was kind of interesting, but also very strange because I was thinking about the situation for work. And then, I was trying to work and I had the situation at work and I was really thinking about it. And so, I had this dream that my boss told me to order catering. And then, I woke up and I realized it was not happening.","I had tons of different jobs when I was in college - cocktail waitressing, being a flight attendant, temp work, teaching aerobics. I was on the boardwalk spinning the wheel.

All of a sudden, there was a light bulb that went off one day, and I went to see a film called ""The Commitment."" I remember that was the first time I'd actually seen the job called a music supervisor. I was like, ""Oh, that sounds good.""

Before I found my area, I was worried. I saw a lot of my friends struggle with not trying in fear of what could be. I've always had the personality that was like, ""I need to know."" I'm such a big believer in encouraging your own voice because that's what makes you, you.",4,81,159
"Yeah. So, as I mentioned before, I started reading this book called ""Unearthly Gorgeous"" by Ocean Vaughn, and actually, Ocean Vaughn came to my school. Actually, when I graduated, he spoke at my commencement ceremony. And reading this book made me think about the fact that if I had read this book a year ago or a year and a half ago, that when Ocean Vaughn came, I would have known him, would have known his work, and something about his life and all these very deeply personal things that he\'s written about. And I just started to wonder why I didn\'t discover this book before. But then, I started just like as I was on the train and as I was walking home, really thinking about how I feel since graduating College and all the things that I\'ve done since then, that I have changed a lot in a really quick or really short period of time. And that some of the different books and different things that have been that are just coming to me now have been postponed but I got years ago but didn\'t start. That maybe they are a part of my current change and the fact that I pick them up again is a part of my current change and will help in the growth that is to come. And yeah, I think just reading this book and the past few months, a lot of things have just been kind of impacting me in a different way. And it\'s very interesting because there\'s a lot about it that is philosophical, a lot of it that\'s mental. Some things are sad, some things that are happy. It\'s like so many things mixed up together. So, yeah, that\'s not just one story, but kind of an ongoing story of my current time.","I'm the first person out of four living generations to have left Mississippi. I didn't write when I was in Mississippi. I didn't perform. I didn't even know I had the capacity to do what I do now until I moved. I was never in an environment where that was encouraged or even understood.

No one asked me my story, and that was problematic for me. I didn't feel connected in a way that other people felt connected in Mississippi.

People describe me usually, or often, as an inspirational poet. My story helps other people tell their stories too. To me, that's the beauty of life; it's the people that you see. It's the stories that we tell. It's the stories that we remember, and it's how they affect us.",4,348,158
"Okay. So this is the only story I can think of, and hopefully it\'ll be a little interesting to you, Jivo. So basically, I met this guy on a train platform a few days ago, and he walked up to me and he said something like, ""Hi, how are you doing?"" And then somehow segued the conversation to talking about the difficulty of finding community in Boston. I think he said something like, ""Oh, this is where I\'m from, blah, blah."" And then we got on the train, traveled a little bit, and he\'s like, ""Oh, you know, we should chat again as I\'m getting off."" Okay, he\'s pretty interesting. So then, a few days ago, we got lunch and chatted for an hour or two. And I had already sent, like, ""Oh, maybe this guy is kind of approaching me because he thinks I\'m attractive in some way, just physically."" And we did have some things, some overlaps or something that are common or shared. But he would always move from the things that I was most interested in to talking about what he seemed to be most interested in sharing. And now, he is trying to get me to hang out with him, and we met less than a week ago. So, I\'m currently in a place of trying to figure out how to be kind to another person and treat them well without feeling like I owe them anything or have a certain responsibility to do or say or give anything that I don\'t want to. Yeah, so that\'s a story for my week.","I work in an emergency room, and for the past several weeks, a surgical resident and I have gotten closer and closer in getting to know each other. He is extremely handsome, intelligent, and very down to earth. 

The last shift we worked together was a few days ago. He spent a large portion of the shift hanging out and talking by my side while I worked, talking about family, asking for my advice, and just overall observing me work. 

I waited all shift for him to ask me for coffee or even my number, but it didn't come. When he did leave to go back to the surgical floor, all of the nurses were gushing to me about how jealous they all were. One berated me for not getting his number first. 

I don't know if he's just being nice or if I should just give him my number.",5,324,170
"Sure. This morning, I had a really frustrating experience with my partner who is afraid of needles, which means that he is uncomfortable getting blood drawn and has not gotten blood drawn or lab work done in several years since he was a child, and now he's an adult. So he really should do that. I went through the trouble of trying to figure out an at-home option to just do a few drops of blood and test, like most of the things that need to be tested. But he struggled to do it this morning and was also very grumpy and cranky about it. I felt sort of frustrated because I'm not like the bad guy here. I'm an adult, and it's important for you to take care of your health. So I don't really understand why I'm like the sort of villain of the story.","Last week, I went on a plane for the first time. It has rocked my world. I'm from Michigan, where going to the store is a 25-minute commute. Driving is just what you do all of the time, for everything. Why would vacation be any different?

I've spent the last 26 years of my life driving up to 16 hours (in one day), one way, to travel to other states. I was always given horror stories about airports from my relatives - my GOD, they make you take off your shoes!

Finally, my husband and I decided to go to Vegas, and there's no way we're driving because last time we drove on vacation 16 hrs, he got a blood clot and had to be on blood thinners for three months as a 30-year-old.

So we go via some podunk airline, and the whole process is just super painless. We get in and out of security quick, bag checked super quick, boarded super quick. The way everyone made it sound was like a 4-hour process! Nope.

I am NEVER taking such long car rides again! If I never have to drive through Ohio again, I will be fully contented.",2,166,232
"Okay. The story I'd like to tell is about setting boundaries at work. I think that the last few days, I've been struggling with working with people who are not necessarily either totally in tune with my responsibilities as a consultant or people who are just, like, sort of frazzled and pushing responsibility onto me. And I think that I've been feeling like I need to set better boundaries or I need to be clearer with myself about what those expectations are. Like, whether it's okay to scope research without an expectation of being paid for those hours, whether I need to price that into future work, or whether that's just something that I need to set better boundaries about.","I found a new job closer to my house that pays more and has better benefits. It's a larger company, so I won't have to deal with the clique mentality that has taken over my current job. 

I won't have to do the work of 6 people while never being recognized. I won't have to deal with a toxic mentality where my boss pulls me into an office to yell at me for not clicking on one of my screens for an hour when my job requires 14 open. 

I won't have to listen to my boss say I can't step away from my desk when I'm having panic attacks from my PTSD or hear a different manager giggle about comments that my appointments take me out of the office. 

I don't have to deal with so much rudeness and double standards and having me do the work of a department with no recognition and people who's slack I've been picking up get promoted.",2,136,181
"I have recently been going through a bit of a reckoning with a close friend of mine from college. So, we met 10-12 years ago. And he lives in a different city. And we haven't spent a ton of time together recently. Though we have spent a lot of time talking on the phone and recently we spent a week together traveling. And I realized that the way that he has started, or maybe has always sort of spoken about women, really was off-putting to me. And I had a conversation with him about it. And he was very defensive and did not necessarily seem to think that there was a problem, and instead sort of turned it around on me and said that I'm being really conservative or Puritan or whatever it is. When in reality, I think I was just asserting that women deserve respect and to not be spoken about like objects. And yeah, I haven't spoken to him since, a month or six weeks. It was probably always happening. We've always disagreed on how he treats people and how he doesn't necessarily extend the same respect or reciprocity to them as they do to him.","Today I talked with a few of my friends about the face reveal of a quite popular person and showed them a picture. Almost immediately, they started calling them ugly and compared them to people and characters who are usually seen as unattractive/memes. Personally, I cannot stand such behavior. It's okay to say, ""Yeah, they're not my type"" or that you think one is unattractive, but do you really need to shame?

I told them that, and they said that they were just stating an opinion and that it's okay since the person was an asshole in the past. I told them that it doesn't matter what the person did but what they're doing, and that I think it's wrong to do so.

As I too face body shaming quite often, it definitely hurt. I brought up said experiences, and they told me that this is a ""me-problem"" and has nothing to do with the discussion. We are - or were - friends for many years now, we went through so much, and for all of them, I acted as a therapist, but this is a me-problem? I don't know anymore.

I left the group chat afterwards because the discussion kept dragging on, and I had worse things happen in my life than discussing stuff with people who obviously don't care about what I'm even saying. Two of my other friends agreed, but they never joined the discussion.

All I know is that I have facial dysmorphia, so someone making fun of one's face is just making me feel worse about me, even though that can't be used as a justification as both of them got bullied and also know how it is to be said horrible things of. They engaged in cancel culture in the past (even though they'd never admit it), so I guess I was stupid for even starting this discussion, but it really hurt to see people I called my friends being such assholes to a person about things they cannot control.

If you're mad about what a person said or did, that is perfectly fine, but body shaming someone is just a move of one who doesn't know better. I'm sorry to them if I was being harsh. I didn't sleep well that night, and it definitely rubbed a nerve, but I know they're not sorry.",5,223,456
"Yeah. I've been having a couple of really frustrating experiences at work with a specific person. Who I feel, like, is very sort of toxic in the way that they operate. But also, I don't know whether it's just, like, poor social skills or just a lack of care for others, a lack of empathy. They will set up meetings that don't have any agendas. They'll sort of discredit or devalue other people's experiences or opinions. They are very territorial. It's very hard for them to acknowledge other people's contributions, I guess, or work well with other people that they feel are threatening. And yeah, we had a meeting recently that was the person that was bringing together a team of people who don't work on the same team anymore, but it's sort of like a power grab for them to still be considered like the head of this sort of discipline of research. And they spent the entire meeting just making everyone else anxious about how our new director, essentially, asked this person whether we do a review of quantitative research before it goes out or not. And so this person communicated that out to our team with no purpose other than just to spread his sort of anxiety out to other people. And then basically had no updates on that, since I think probably because it wasn't a real thing that anyone should be concerned about. But it was framed as this sort of, like, urgent conversation that our team needs to have. And yeah, I just have been feeling frustrated about that.","After leaving an abusive workplace where I had no life and no room for development at the beginning of the year, I left and started a new job. It's been fantastic to work at this amazing place that feels like somewhere I can grow. Everything seems amazing, and I'm getting great feedback. I have a job I can have a life around again, and my social life blossoms.

Today, I got dumped after a couple of months of dating this girl. Her reasoning being that she doesn't want to hurt me, and her mental health is preventing her from growing and wants to work on herself. Understandable and fair, I get it, and have been in her shoes.

I get called into a meeting with my manager. She tells me that my colleagues don't like my attitude and state I'm difficult to work with. I've really pushed myself at this new job and tried to grow, giving 110% wherever I can and picking up extra shifts just to get as much experience as possible. I try to be friendly with all my colleagues, and when things get busy (I work in hospitality), I'm all action and try to delegate and stay on it as best I can.

In my meeting, my manager told me my coworkers feel like I overstep the mark and act like the boss (even when fellow supervisors say they want me to take the reins and for me to lead). I'm told I'm scary to some staff, even when I'm always trying to be friendly and helpful to others. All around, I'm told that I'm not getting a promotion because my work attitude is wrong. I apparently treat staff like cattle, and I'm near enough told I should quit.

This all happened over a 3-day period where I was pulling an 11-hour closing shift, into an early morning opening shift. And all I can think of is covering more shifts to try and improve my performance and prove myself more. Stack this with me having car trouble, and I feel like my life is spiraling out of control out of nowhere.",2,306,407
"I have a friend who just found out that our manager has been doing something that she doesn't appreciate, which is that she asked him about mid-year promotions and he told her that they weren't doing mid-year promotions. And then today she found out that actually, someone else got promoted. So she's very upset and she thinks that our manager should have done a better job sort of advocating for her and protecting her and just sort of being on her team, versus kind of toeing the line of what comes from above him.","So I lost my job. It was so unexpected. I had been working for him for 2 and a half years. When the boss returned from his last trip, we learned the sale was never made. In fact, there weren't any sales all year. The boss continued acting normal. Until one day, he called me and told me he had to let me go. He said, ""You can either quit, which will look better on your resume, or I will fire you. You choose, sign these papers.""

It all happened so fast. I grabbed my stuff and walked out. I was relieved because I couldn't stand him, but I was shocked that I wasn't even given a heads up!

It was so shocking because this boss prided himself on making a connection in his establishment. He always boasted about how much better his company was because he wasn't a corporation. Often times, tasks involved his personal life, such as taking his mom to the grocery store or going into his house when no one was home to retrieve something for him. A few times, I had to go let his dog out.

Still, I was let go, told to leave, and I haven't returned.",3,103,242
"So, my partner's niece has been really struggling lately. She was an inpatient at a psychiatric treatment for about a year, and she just went home about a week ago. And we have been working on, well, not her father, and everyone else who's there is sort of working on trying to help her transition back into sort of outpatient life. But she seems to be really struggling - sort of having anxiety and depression, and sort of these angry outbursts of irritation, and just sort of general, like, not doing well. Yeah, I guess I don't really have much of a story with an arc. I guess we're in the middle of the story. But that's what I've been thinking about a lot lately.","This has been an extremely exhausting last few months, emotionally. My mother, who has always suffered with anxiety and depression, was admitted into a psychiatric ward in May after a particularly difficult bout of depression. We found out she was not taking her medicine. She had entered into a psychotic state, and it ended up taking 5 weeks before she could be released. She changed hospitals twice. 

I do not live where my mother does, so I had to take time off work and spend a lot of time traveling. It was unbelievably exhausting. I did, however, develop a lot of friendships with her caretakers. 

In the end, she made huge progress, thankfully. However, we are all concerned the issue will return. She is home now and doing ok, but she may never be the same. Now she is doing group therapy weekly. Additionally, she is back on meds that should work. 

I am back to work now and do not visit as much. I used to feel guilty, but at this point, I am beyond tired.",5,148,206
"Hello. On Wednesday, I went to a senior center and packed lunches for seniors who can't leave their home easily. And then this week, I started delivering meals to those people, and it's been really lovely. It's made me feel really good about myself.","I'm the associate director of Donor Relations and Engagement at End Street Village. I've volunteered my whole life, and giving back was how I was raised. I was like, yeah, I need to be in non-profit. 

So, End Street Village is the largest provider of supportive services in housing for women experiencing homelessness in DC. We have five sites around the city. That includes a full spectrum of housing, from emergency and temporary shelter to recovery housing and permanent supportive housing. 

A large chunk of my job is focused on donor stewardship. So after people give a gift to an organization, we want them to feel the love. It's really important that they understand where their money is going and understand the impact that their dollars are having.",2,54,146
"Yesterday, my daughter's birthday party. We invited 13 kids and some parents of them. And we had a fun time with them.","Just a few months ago, I was able to go to my best friend's daughter's first birthday party. This was very exciting for me because this is my first close friend to have a child while I have two already and another that is due soon. Because we have been so busy since adulthood, her with work, and me being a mom, working, and going to school, it was a great opportunity to get together.

My daughter was especially excited because she was really wanting the new baby to be a girl, but it is not. She has that opportunity to spend time with a baby girl. Even though they are not actually family, me and my friend have always been so close that the kids will be raised more like cousins than friends.

I also got to see her family for the first time in a while, which was nice. It felt like 'coming home.' This family is one that I have spent many holidays with over the years, including major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas that you typically spend with family. There were no other friends of the family at the party; it was only family members, and that made me feel quite warm.

It also was the first time I got to see my friend's new house. She had been living with her spouse and baby at her mom's house since she was pregnant, and it was very exciting to see them moving out and being more independent. While I love her family, it is always good to have your own space as an adult.

I really look forward to our kids growing up together and couldn't be happier still. We even talked about having sleepovers with my 6-year-old daughter and her 1-year-old. I am feeling so excited about the future after this party.",1,27,343
"I have our big leftover from yesterday\'s birthday party. And I thought, okay. I was going to bring this box of pizza to homeless people. Maybe they are hungry. But it reminded me of a certain period of time ago. I saw a homeless man holding a sign. ""I am hungry"" and ""help me"". ""God bless you"". And so I didn\'t have cash. I passed him but I went to a pizza store and got a slice or two of pizza for him and came back to him. And handed the pizza off to him, but he said, ""oh, okay. I\'m good. Too much pizza"". So I gave him the small cash that my husband had. At that time, I didn\'t have cash, but my husband did. Usually, I feel good when I think I am doing good. But that time, I didn\'t feel not so much good because I went to the pizza store for him. Of course, I didn\'t ask him if he wanted pizza, but I did. So I expected him to say thank you and accept that slice of pizza. But I noticed that the way I wanted to treat the person was not the way he wanted to be treated. I can\'t expect to be said thank you. Yeah, I would take the pizza from yesterday\'s birthday party. It reminded me of that memory.","Where I live, there is one really busy intersection that always has at least two homeless people combing it for food and stuff, and most of them you can tell are fakers looking for money and pity (dogs, phones, new clothes). But today was different.

This guy was obviously in pain. He was hunched over a little bit and limped really slowly. He looked pretty elderly, and when he spoke, it was very heavy and slow, as if it was a task.

I always have food on me specifically because I feel bad for the homeless there, and today I had two fig bars. The car in front of me gave him a pastry, and you could tell he was pretty happy.

His sign was pretty beat up, and all I could read was ""hungry,"" so I gave him one of my fig bars. He noticed what it was, and he perked up and began thanking me over and over, saying that pastries and fig bars were ""his favorite thing in the whole world."" So, I gave him the other one I had, and he looked at me as if he couldn't believe it.

He said, ""Thank you so much, man. I love fig bars. You have a blessed day. God bless you,"" and I got chills because he was so genuine and grateful. It made me so happy knowing that I had given someone who had nothing their favorite thing in the whole world!",5,274,287
"My daughter, Lena, went to a bakery walk shop yesterday. She made two kinds of pastry up there: a sweet one and a savory one. The sweet one was Turbulen, Blackberry, and the savory one was cheese and potato. Both are delicious. It was a two-hour session, but actually it took almost 3 hours. So when I went to pick her up, the kids were still waiting for their baked goods. So while I was waiting for the kids, I utilized that time to chat with other parents. But my son was super tired and hungry after his swimming lesson. So I had to stop chatting and began to entertain him. But after all, the gallant was so tasty and my daughter was so enjoying the time. And she was so proud of what she did. So I think $85 was worth it. I think it was a good experience for her, for me too.","Today, I asked my mum how she made that rice with saffron. After I ate the rice, I remembered a meat replacement she made for me when I was vegetarian. She put together mushrooms and zucchini, rolled it in egg, put breadcrumbs around it, then fried it in a pan.

She put so much thought into it. Even after she came home from work, she wanted to make a good meal for me. I'm so thankful for all those meals she cooked. It makes me happy.

I love my mum.",4,179,105
"So, a few days ago, I got letters from my mom. She apologized for what she did to me when I was a kid. I don't want to mention the specific detail of what she did, but she was too focused on something over me, and it was more than 30 years ago. So, I'm still suffering from it. I'd like to accept the apology, but I don't know what to say, or how to deliver the message. The problem is she always apologizes about that, but that's it. She doesn't try to fix it or compensate for it. And of course, we cannot go back to the past. We live now, but I think we can still fix it. There is still a way to mitigate the issue. Except for that issue, we've been getting along and I love her. I understand no one is perfect, but sometimes I feel if she was so bad, I wish I could hate her. I know this is a very childish, teenager-ish idea, but it is true that I feel that way sometimes. And after that, after I feel so bad, I feel guilty to have failed. I don't want her to apologize to me about that anymore.","My mom has done so much for me. But she also has done a lot of bad. A lot that's hurt me. I hope she can see that I was always trying to look out for her. I hope she knows that I didn't like the men she brought home because they were mean to me. I hope she knows that I wanted her to be happy. 

I hope she knows I didn't lie about him pissing on my bed. I hope she knows I didn't lie about him threatening to kill me. I hope she knows I never lied about him drinking vodka as soon as he woke up. I hope she knows I was scared for my life.

I hope she knows I tried to help when he hit her. I hope she knows I wanted to forgive her. I hope she knows I did all I could to explain and excuse your actions.

But I was my own mother. I had to deal with all of her feelings and all of her burdens; she made them mine. I was alone. I never had friends. She knew I, as a 15-year-old, was in a relationship with a 24-year-old man. She offered to fly me to him. She was a bad mom.

And I will never forgive her.",3,247,247
"So yesterday, I took my daughter to her swimming lesson. She has been taking private lessons for a couple of weeks and she was so scared of the water. She was not able to go under the water, but now she can swim, although she cannot breathe unless she can hold her breath. She can continue swimming until that time when she needs to breathe. So, it is very impressive improvement. I'm so proud of her.","In 5th grade (when I was 10), I joined my school's cross country team. My friend joined as well. She was already the MVP and had an amazing season; I was about the 5th best on a very small team.

Today we were catching up at our lockers and I asked about the football game this past Saturday (we won); the topic switched to my cross country meet that morning. She was at the finish line when I won.

Back to today, she was mentioning how fast I've gotten and how proud she was of me. That hit hard because she's always been good at any sport she's tried, and I finally feel like her: winning!

She made my day better and gave me a little confidence boost for training and racing.",4,88,154
"Yesterday, my daughter and her friend made their first ever lemonade stand. Together, her mom (I mean, the friend's mom) helped them. She helped them make lemonade, create a sign for it, and even got text messages from the mother. So, I went to the town and the lemonade was super delicious. I was so proud of them.","I worked in an office, and every place that I worked at I ended up computerizing. I ended up starting a company in manufacturing. But I always knew that I was meant to do something to help other people.

And I was in Niger. And there was a little girl that came up to me with flies on her face. And I just felt that that's intolerable. That could have been my granddaughter. How could I not do something?

I think that I have the opportunity to live what I think should be the American Dream, when what I think should be the American Dream is that we use these resources, we use these talents, to help those that didn't get that.",1,72,137
"So this weekend, I went on a short trip, just a day trip, to a city called Kernel by the sea. I was recommended to visit the city by one of my friends, and she was saying the city is really cute. And yeah, she liked their citizens. She has visited the city several times so far, so I did too. And yeah, it was a cute, beautiful city. There were lots and lots of people inside, sightseeing and shopping. And the city is full of art, so there are many art galleries. That is something I am not so familiar with, but I stopped by several galleries. And yeah, it was a nice trip. And also, I went to a nice restaurant, a Greek restaurant, and the kids wanted to go. So they were a bit bored besides seeing the city. But there was a plate named Flaming Cheese. So they put the cheese on the pan and pour rum or some alcohol and let it catch fire. And yeah, it was surprising for them. Yeah, overall, it was a nice day trip.","Three weeks ago, I took a trip to Budapest, Hungary with one of my childhood best friends. I was already in Europe because I had been working in Madrid, Spain. I took a short flight and met my friend in Hungary. She was pretty jet-lagged since she came from the United States, but we went out for dinner that night. We were absolutely blown away with how delicious Hungarian food is. We had delicious stew and soup. I was worried initially about how the food would be. I do not eat meat, and I read prior that Hungarians love their meat, but I had no trouble finding vegetarian options.

The next day on our trip, we saw the beautiful Parliament building and a beautiful castle. I remember walking up many stairs and getting tired in the hot summer sun. Suddenly though, we reached an archway that took us to the end of the tunnel. There was sunlight peaking through and some of the most beautiful architecture I had ever seen. I saw beautiful mosaics and a cobblestone square that overlooked the entire city of Budapest. Perfectly situated was a bar where we could sit down and look out at the view of the city and parliament building on the other side of the water. It was absolutely breathtaking and my favorite part of the trip.

A close second for my favorite part of the trip was a sunset boat ride we took that allowed us to later see the lit-up buildings at night. We finished our last day of the trip with going to the famous baths. It was perfect timing to relax after having walked many miles the days before. The baths are said to have healing qualities but regardless, I found them very relaxing.

This trip was amazing overall. I really enjoyed sharing an international experience with one of my best friends. I hadn't seen her for almost a year, so it was really great to catch up and kind of share with her a little bit of my chaotic life when I was working in Europe.",4,217,382
"Okay, I am taking on MBA course and in the course, I am currently taking Professional Communication Management. But the instructors and the assistance of them are not so professional. In their communications, for instance, they are teaching to respond chat pretty quickly. But what they're doing is they respond to chat message four days after that the message I send so it is a little frustrating.","I am the marketing director here at Valen Analytics. Our company builds predictive models, and we also have a platform that hosts them, which integrates into the company workflows for property and casualty companies. So the predictive models basically allow them to better price and select risks. So yeah, I do the execution of the marketing campaigns and the coordination with inside sales.

So I graduated, and then I worked in the mental health industry for a while. And decided that that was not good for my own mental health. It was very stressful, very taxing. So I went back to school, got my masters in marketing. I thought that I was gonna be able to graduate and step right into a marketing job, but there was a lot more business acumen that needed to be developed before I was really prepared for that.

I had to be humbled and grounded a bit more to realize, yeah, you have a foundation. But that foundation, the degree, is not your golden ticket into the chocolate factory. The degree is what may help open the door, but you've got to earn your way the rest of the way.

So the way I interpreted that is, I need to make sure that I'm really putting forward the solid performance at what I'm doing now and then set forth my next goal.",3,76,258
"So, staying with positive things, I guess I was thinking about the other night when my team in high school won the basketball state championship in Texas. It was a really big deal for me. And something that I realized is that this happened over 13 years ago. But I realized something that carried through, that I learned somehow along the way playing basketball from that game. I remember feeling somewhat shocked when we won it. And everyone around me, all my other teammates, were jumping up and down, kind of crying, and excited. I, on the other hand, was a little bit more in disbelief and somewhat like, ""Oh, okay, we won."" I wasn\'t as externally excited as everyone else. And I just played in a tennis tournament with a team that I have now in my adult life, and the same thing is true. When I win something, I\'m kind of like, ""Okay, yeah, let\'s keep going."" And everybody else around me is jumping up and down. It\'s just a very interesting thing to think about that. I\'ve always sort of been, I guess, focused and not as excitable externally as other people around me.","I used to hate my dad with a certain passion that now I can only describe as ignorantly hating someone. But now I love him more than I thought I ever would. The only thing I have to thank for this is football and sports as a whole.

I'm 18, and for the years between 2015 and 2019, I hated my dad. I didn't want to hear his voice or even see him. But when I got into high school and played for my school's football team, and he showed up to my first game because my older sister told him I was playing, I started feeling happier than I thought I'd ever be and felt ashamed for the first time in my life.

But it wasn't just the first game. It was one after the other. He missed the ones that were like an hour drive from our town, but he was there for almost every one of them. I'll never forget the look in his eyes when he hugged me tighter than I'd ever felt him hug me and heard that deep bellow in his voice that I once thought annoying.

I heard the words, ""Son, I'll never not be proud of you"" after we had lost our game-ending season. But he didn't care that we lost. He cared that I had worked. I never felt very confident during that first year, but just hearing him tell me that made me happier than I'd ever been. It gave me this sense of pride that I'd never felt.

My dad changed my life by being there. He changed my life by making me realize that his past doesn't define who he is now. He made me change more than I thought I could.",2,237,334
"So, I was kind of looking at old pictures but also thinking about pictures from my childhood. And my mom is really embarrassed about herself. She's always been, ever since I can remember. And it's funny because a lot of times in old pictures, I'll see my sister and I or my sister and other people in our family. But it's always weird seeing my mom in old pictures because it's so rare. And it's also rare, a little weird feeling, remembering that person who she was because she was so pretty and so young. Very, very young, but also so tormented. Just she has a lot of depression and anxiety. And I didn't know what it was as a kid. And I remember just not realizing how the situation I was in until getting out and looking back. So, seeing these old pictures of my sister and I kind of just, it's funny to see. It just makes me feel grateful for my sister, for being there when it was a little bit difficult but also just, I feel a little bit lucky that that little girl that was me in the pictures had no idea. I didn't try to wrap my head too far around the struggles that my mom was going through. And I kind of just picked up and treaded through all of her stuff that she was trying to put on me. And now I'm a stronger person for it. But looking back at pictures with seeing her in them and knowing what she used to say about herself, and it was totally not true, and especially looking back now, it's just a very interesting feeling to see that.","I'm sick and tired of hearing people constantly talk about suicide in passing or as a joke. Every year at my high school, with the exception of my senior year, had at least one suicide per school year, two of which were my brother's friends, and one of which was my friend. 

People don't understand the suffocating pain that occurs when you get the call telling you that someone you love committed suicide. They don't understand the sound of anguish your big brother makes when he loses the kid he grew up with or the pain of seeing everyone you care about suffering in the wake of death.

They don't understand the guilt and self-loathing. They don't understand that three years later you still fear every phone call you get, worrying that the next one will break you. 

I still feel sick to this day knowing that my friends will never be here again, that I won't ever see them again, never hear their laughs, see them grow up, fall in love, or find happiness.",1,325,199
"So, when I was in elementary school, I was a very active kid and independent. I would run around the neighborhood and ring people's doorbells, ask my friends to play, and was not afraid to go and do these things by myself.\n\nI had a friend. I had several friends move away, but I had one friend in particular that moved away when I was in, I believe it was the fourth grade. And we had just recently completed this activity called Flat Stanley, where you sent this flat... we read this story about a boy who was flattened and was shipped all around to visit people. I can't remember the exact story, but what we did is we then would send the Flat Stanley to somebody.\n\nSo that made it me fascinated with this idea of mail. And so when my friend moved away in the fourth grade, we became pen pals, which was fun. And I remember being so excited to get these handwritten letters and how exciting it was to just send a letter off and be anticipating the next one coming back around. We could have called each other, but we were in fourth grade and the mail was much more exciting. And I just remember how excited I was to be able to get a piece of mail.","Initially, I did not want to be a teacher. But as I went through school, I realized by the time I was in high school that I needed to be a teacher. The reason that I needed to be a teacher was because I loved school a lot. I loved learning a lot. But I didn't have a teacher that I really liked. 

I felt, at a young age, that if I had had that kind of experience where I felt connected to my school and connected to at least one teacher, I would've been an even better student and school would've been a better experience for me. 

I felt that when it was time for me to become a teacher, my job was not to be your friend but for you to know, as strict as I was, that I still cared about you, and I cared about your achievement, and I cared about you as a human being. 

I've gotten to a place in my life where what is most important to me is to make a difference, no matter how small or how big, it's to make a difference. 

Whatever you decide to do in your lives, it has to be something that becomes your life work. It has to be your life work. Because this world now is at a place where you can make money, you certainly can make money. And you can make a lot of money. But your life's work, a piece of it has to be able to help other people.",3,244,293
"Okay. So my first summer when I went to Rhode Island School of Design. With a D. Was so fun. I was in for a master\'s of architecture. But. I had to do a summer program since my background wasn\'t in my bachelor\'s, wasn\'t in architecture. And it wasn\'t architecturally related, but it was probably my favorite part of RISD, because we took all of the foundation courses. With the transfer students that were going to be sophomores. And I painted this massive. It was like eight feet by eight feet. Painting for one of the finals, and it was supposed to be like based off an amoeba. But really I just liked it because the colors were blue. My sister liked it, so I gave the painting to my sister. Right before I guess she had graduated medical school, and I was moving into an apartment in New Jersey. And she wanted to hang up the painting. And so it was like right before I left. For. Some. I forgot what it was, but I think I was going somewhere for the summer. I helped her hang it up in her apartment. And it was really funny because my sister, usually she\'s older than me, and she\'s always kind of been like a second mom. So she\'s always been very bossy. And this time around, she doesn\'t know what we\'re supposed to be doing to hang it. And so I was just very patient and calm with trying to give directions on how we were going and explaining it before we actually did it. Instead of having us trying to hang this eight foot painting and like yelling at each other. And the funniest thing is after we hung it, she was like, ""Oh. You are really good at giving directions. I would definitely listen to you. You\'re so calm and nice."" And I was like, ""Yeah, whenever I\'m in charge, I\'m actually pretty clear and patient with people."" So it\'s kind of a funny memory.","I started out as a chemistry major at the University of Washington, and I didn't do very well in chemistry. It was really tough. I went to my advisor and he said, ""Well, of course you're not doing very well. You know, women do not belong in chemistry."" And I was a freshman, so I said, ""Oh, okay."" 

I went and changed my major, and I ended up as a biologist, but I think that what got me through is I really, really did want to be a scientist. I just had to tough it out because in the end, there isn't anything that anyone does that doesn't have its challenges, or its hard days, or its really difficult times. 

You have to figure out what it is that you wanna spend most of your time on, so that most of your time, there's something that really is rewarding going on. That gets you through the hard times.",4,397,192
"So, my parents have never, ever gotten along. They knew each other for a year, ended up finding out they were pregnant with my sister, and got married. Probably shouldn\'t have. Then had me two years later. And then pretty much were never happy with each other and I just remember one particular night where they were fighting. They would have these really brutal fights where they would just yell at the top of their lungs at each other. And sometimes it would get physical. And I was in, I think, first grade. And I woke up to one of these fights.\n\nAnd I got out of the top bunk of my bed, walked out into the living room, and saw my dad on top of my mom, biting her. And then I went back to my room because I was scared. I mean, and they were equally yelling at each other. And then I heard a loud noise. And more yelling, and I walked out, and my mom had run into a room, locked herself in there, and my dad had punched the door. And I asked him what was going on. And he bent down and was like, ""It\'s okay, Madison, go back to bed."" And I was like, ""Why did you punch the door?"" And he was like, ""It\'s okay."" There was clearly a hole in it. It was really scary. And I just went back to bed.\n\nLots of these situations happened when I was a kid. Something that my sister and I have come to discover through therapy and talking is that the reason we\'re not so mad at our dad as much as we are at mom. It\'s because mom. She would instigate a lot of these fights. I don\'t think my dad should have been doing a lot of these things either, but I think the reason that I hold more of a grudge towards my mom is because she took it out on us, and my dad never did. And my dad was equally violent and shouldn\'t have been. But my mom, when they did finally divorce and separate and my dad moved out, my mom started treating us how she treated my dad. And it took a lot of therapy to not feel like it was my fault.","My mom has always been a good mom. She took care of 2 kids going to 2 different schools, with one of them having half custody with her dad. When I was 5, my mom met my stepdad and soon enough, they had another boy. Up until this point, my mother had given no reason for me to dislike her. But this all took a turn for the worse when COVID came around. My mother lost her job, but because of non-COVID related reasons, and she got off her anxiety medication because it was starting to make her lose weight.

Once, when my mom was arguing with my stepdad, she started bawling her eyes out, and I asked why, and she admitted she had depression. That's all I know about her medical conditions.

In 2020, she started being horrible to my sister, even though she was the oldest sibling and did the most around the house. And a few months ago, my stepdad and mom fighting became a biweekly thing. She threatened to break up with him almost every time they got into an argument.

About 2 months ago, we moved into a better house that could better fit 5 people and 2 dogs. It only gotten worse from there. She would get mad because the house was going to be under my stepdad's name until they got married in about 6 months, and she said she would move back into her old house and never see him again.

But instead of it being a biweekly thing, it now happens every single day. And I don't know how to deal with it. My sister and I have to just sit in our rooms and hope our little brother isn't hearing every word they say. Even though we know for a fact he is. I hear her threatening to commit suicide, to give us away to our grandmother.

I don't know what to do. I'm still a minor and can't live without my parents. I can't even stand to look at my mom anymore. I hate her. And I don't think I will ever take that back. No matter how many ""heartfelt"" apologies she gives me after literally threatening to kick me out in a way where she doesn't have any repercussions.",4,445,435
"Yeah, so actually, yesterday I always, whenever I go out with my mom, she\'s always super negative, I realized. And won\'t go to counseling, won\'t try to make herself better. And she\'s always on edge. So I always come into interacting with her, kind of on the defense because she\'s going to be super negative. She\'s going to talk over me. She\'s going to either try to get attention with poor, pitiful me stories. And yesterday, we went to dinner. I was a little defensive. She tried to jump in and she tried to talk over me. And at one occasion, I just kept talking for like 10 seconds until she finally stopped talking and then was like, ""Oh, what were you saying?"" And it\'s like, well, I was not finished talking. But I was trying to stay calm and not mean. I mean, I got a new job, that was a big deal. She asked one question about it and then tried to make the whole dinner about her. And I intentionally didn\'t ask her questions about her job, about teaching because that\'s all she has, and that\'s all she talks about, and it\'s always negative. And I don\'t have the headspace for it. And then I started trying to tell a story that included my boyfriend and her, and she just jumped in and tried to tell a version of it that she remembers, which was not true. And I kind of was like, ""Okay, never mind. I was trying to tell a funny story, and you just ruined it."" So she was also kind of defensive about that. But at the end, she came over to my house to see my table and asked me to walk her out to her car. And I tried to just walk her to the door because she does this thing where she always has to have attention. She\'ll try to pull you off to the side and only isolate you from the crowd, so she can have attention, and it\'s just drives me crazy. So I was like, ""Okay."" She\'s like, ""You\'re not going to walk me to my car."" It\'s like, ""Okay, then."" She\'s like, ""What\'s wrong?"" And I pretty much told her that it\'s hard to have a conversation with her whenever she\'s negative, and she just immediately started crying, which is really annoying because I feel like she puts all of her happiness on me and requires me to be her therapist. And I just can\'t do that anymore because it\'s exhausting. So we ended up- I mean, I\'m proud of how I handled it because I stayed calm. But we had to have this conversation where she\'s crying in front of my house and trying to tell me that I\'m being mean. And I told her specific examples of where she acts like she\'s pitying herself. And then I finally did tell her I was like, ""Honestly, for us to have a relationship, it\'s like, I don\'t want to be your counselor."" And I\'m angry. I used to be angry at you for how you treated me as a kid, but I\'m over that because I did the work. But now I\'m angry because I\'m angry that you have all these opportunities to make yourself better and be happy and you don\'t want to do it. And it\'s annoying to watch, and it\'s really hard. And I don\'t want to be your therapist. I cannot be your therapist."" And she just cried. And then today, she sent me a text message that was like, kind of putting some of it on me about how I don\'t want to see her, but I keep these boundaries. And she complains about the boundaries. And then whenever I do tell her, give her an honest truth, she says, ""We need to take space."" So I don\'t know, I\'m really annoyed with her. She\'s just always done this for my entire life. And I\'m kind of done with it. And it makes me scared that she\'ll kill herself sometimes. I was afraid to let her go home, but also she\'s always pestering me for answers, and the reality of it is that she doesn\'t want to make herself happy or get better. I\'m lucky I have my sister that understands. But it\'s just a lot of weight to put on me, and it\'s really not fair, but the choices that she\'s made. And I choose not to be upset about adversity and problems that I\'ve faced, and I choose to try to go to counseling and get better. And she just won\'t do that at all. She just wants pity. And it\'s so annoying.","Today was a terrible day for me. My co-worker, who we will call the big ""W,"" is usually always mean to me. However, today she was the worst. It was our big Christmas party, and she micromanaged everyone at work today. She started openly complaining about only she was smart, only she did any real work, etc.

Everyone had told me since I started here how terrible she was and how badly they wanted her to be fired. Despite this, no one would ever do anything about her or talk about her until she left the room.

Finally, I snapped and decided not to sit down and take it like everyone else. While she started insisting she told me to do something I was never told, I told her to her face she never said that. She lost it and started to scream at me, while she did that my boss just ignored it like he usually did.

I decided I had enough of a boss that wouldn't do anything and handed him my resignation, which was more than he deserved. He tried to convince me it was cowardly to leave, but I told him it was cowardly to not fire her.

She kept harassing me through the night until that point, then my boss decided to take her to the back room and yell at her for having a coworker finally quit over her. She came back out and stayed quiet for the whole rest of the night.

I left that job and felt good about leaving; they all already didn't like her but it was made worse once she actually cost them a good employee who at least tried their best, which was more than half of the people they hired did.",2,950,328
"Okay. So this one is where I feel like I was in the wrong and analyzing it. So from my dad's side, I have a whole lot of anger and my mom's side is a short temper. As a kid, my mom was verbally abusive, physically abusive. When I was in second or third grade, I watched her pick up my sister by the throat and throw her across the room. I would try to stop things from happening and one time I stood up to her and she tried to grab my arm. That's the same night she threw across the room by her neck and I was like, I was in second grade, I was tiny. And at that point, I realized, oh, shit, I can't help. I'm too small of a human to stop this and my words don't matter. But all of that aside, I've processed that I think what something, though I do feel bad about, is my dad lived in Dallas. He got remarried to my stepmom and my stepmom had already had a daughter. So she's my stepsister. My stepsister was three years younger than me and she's okay. She's only been a different, chaotic household. But not quite like mine that I grew up in. But she was also very manipulative and would say mean things. And my stepmom has always, of course, it's her daughter, so always been kind of more defensive of her, which is fine. She hasn't been bad to me, my stepmom. But when I was in elementary school, my little sister stepsister said something really mean and hurtful, and nobody ever let her held accountable. And I got mad and I told her stop, and she wouldn't stop. And then I did what my mom did, and I picked her up by her neck, and I didn't throw her. But my dad and stepmom saw, so they got mad at me. I mean, of course, I shouldn't have done that. And so I mean, I was in second or third grade. I'd watched my mom do it. I had learned that behavior. And they yelled at me. And they, to this day, still don't let me forget it. And I've told them that I'm sorry. I was just angry and I shouldn't have done that. And I apologized a thousand times, but they won't let me forget it. And I did try to say she wasn't the easiest, she would say really hurtful and mean things. And nobody was and they were like she didn't do that. She was too young to do that. And it's like, no. She's always kind of been that way even as we've gotten older. She's always also been selfish herself and doesn't really care about what's happening around her and will say mean and hurtful things to people and just doesn't care. And isn't very considerate. She has always had an attitude. And I don't understand why. Maybe there are other things there. And that's why I'm defensive and get a little annoyed about it, but yeah, I definitely shouldn't have done that. I feel really bad about it. I do understand that I can get angry and want to, but that's not a solution. I don't do that as an adult, but I do feel pretty shameful about it. That I did that to another person. It's not okay.","My mom has always been a good mom. She took care of 2 kids going to 2 different schools, with one of them having half custody with her dad.

"Yeah. So, I wanted to be a little more positive, maybe a funny story. But I'm a friend, she's my childhood friend, from high school, well even younger than that. And she was also, her mom was also divorced, which, we were in a small town and being a divorced woman was, like, so terrible. And it was my mom and her mom and one other mom in a town of, like, 12,000. I think it's kind of ridiculous for our grade. But I would run all over the neighborhood because my mom would be sleeping and depressed in her house and I wanted to go do something. So I would go outside and play all the time. And I was in, I think, like third grade, going into fourth grade, and I would go ring my friend's doorbells and ask them to play, and looking back now I think it's really funny because kids didn't do that. Kids didn't go and I don't remember anybody actually ever coming over to my house and ringing my doorbell and asking me to play. So sometimes I'm like, oh no, was I that annoying kid? But I didn't seem like it. I think kids were just more shy. So, this friend, when I first met her, I had a friend that was living in that house and they were moving and I had gone by the week before to see if she wanted to play and they were packing up and they told me, you know what? Why don't you come by this day and we'll be here, which looking back now, they just wanted me to leave, I think. But I went over there that day and they were completely gone. There was a whole new family moved in and there was a babysitter there. And I was like, oh wow, okay. And they were like, oh, how old are you? And I was like, oh, I'm in fourth grade. They were like, oh, well, our daughter is in fourth grade. Why don't you come back when she's here? So, I go back, like, I think two days later, they're moved in. This was when the babysitter was there and she was braiding this girl's hair, this blonde girl's hair and she did not want to talk to me. And I was like, Hi, I'm Madison and I'm here to meet you. And I think pretty much, they made her play with me. But she tells me this all the time and I always remember that, is that she remembers being like, Great, I don't want to be here, I don't want to be friends with anybody. And then I came over with cat eyeglasses and braces and talking all excited about how we should be friends and do all these things and we're still friends to this day and I actually go and visit her in Denver. Yeah, very funny friendship. Very funny.","All my ""Friends"" make fun of me for being bad at video games. Same with physical stuff. Got beat by every single one of them in races and arm wrestles. I get told I'm too skinny or all the sports I play are girly and even with so many sports to my name, I still get destroyed in races. 

I'm the laughingstock of my class. I feel like a joke, and my parents laugh at me too. I feel insecure about my body. 

A girl next to me straight up said I look ugly because I have a bit of a mustache growing, and my jaw is too feminine. I feel mentally insecure. I'm not popular, I'm not strong, I'm bad at video games, except for the ones none of my classmates play. 

And I've been challenged by the same girl who made fun of my face to an arm wrestle tomorrow. She does several forms of martial arts.",1,594,185
"Okay. So yesterday, I went to this meetup group. It's an art meetup group, basically for doing digital art with a bunch of people together in a coffee house, which was pretty nice. It's my first time there. Yeah, and I met some new friends, which is very good. I've never really done anything like that in my life, and I've been doing art pretty much just by myself. And it feels very nice to do it with other people. Yeah.","They hold this event in London called New Media Underground Festival. For the event, they did a challenge to design the official event t-shirt and my design won, and then I started Threadless, literally an hour after that.

But I didn't know how to make t-shirts, and I didn't know how to charge people's credit cards online. I didn't know what I was doing.

One thing that's been really important for me is always having a personal project, something you're doing on the side because you never know what it's gonna turn into.",2,99,111
"Okay. So, today, I went to have my nails done. And this is the first time that I tried out nail extensions. So, it makes the nail gets longer, which is super fun, although it was like a very long session. It took two and a half hours. And since I'm also a little bit social, I have a little bit of social phobia, so it feels a little bit draining that I need to sit face to face with the nail tech for two and a half hours straight, and then keep on chatting and stuff. And at the end of it, although I'm very happy with what I've got, I enjoyed the conversation-ish, at the end I felt pretty burnt out and tired. Yeah. And I went back home, sat with my cat, and recharged.","I'm 28, been biting my nails as long as I can remember.

I finally got some hard gels for about 7 weeks and let my actual nails grow out underneath, then had the hard gels removed.

My nails are long, healthy, and strong, and my cuticles aren't a bitten-up mess.

My hands look lovely, and I couldn't be more pleased.",4,162,73
"So, I got scammed. I got scammed, half willingly, but it still feels a little bit bad. So, I was like betting on the person not being a scammer, but I was disappointed. He tends to actually be a scammer. So, the story is, I wanted to learn the musical instrument called Ferrimin. Don\'t know if you have heard of it or not. So, it\'s an electrical instrument that you can play without touching the instrument. So, I joined this Facebook group, and I saw a person selling a second hand. I thought it would be a good deal. So, I contacted the person. And at first, I insisted on I need to pay him using the goods and services option of PayPal, and he\'s keeping having trouble with that. And then, his Venmo doesn\'t work as well. So, every time I send him money using the goods and services, it will be returned back to me, so the money cannot go through. And then, he\'s like, ""Oh, just trust me, just send his money through friends and family."" So, in total, the price is $200. And then he said, ""Oh, you can just send me half of the price, like $100, and then you can send me the rest when your package arrives."" And I\'m like, ""No, the maximum amount I can do upfront is $50."" So at that time, I thought to myself that I do want to be able to trust people and give them the benefit of doubt. And then I\'m like, ""Yeah, why not? It\'s only like $50."" So, why don\'t I can do a candle on this person not being a scammer? Yeah. And if he turns out to not actually be a scammer, then it will be great because first, I can get a thermometer for a good price, and second, I have a good story to tell to my friends about the goodness of the human heart or something like that. Yeah. Anyway, so I basically said to myself, ""Okay, I\'ll just use this $50 to bet on he knocked in a scammer, and if I lose, I lose."" And as it turns out in the very end, he is indeed a scammer. Yeah. Long story short indeed. He indeed was a scam. There are more interactions that I want for you with, but I lost my bad, although I did prepare myself for it, and that did sort of upset this possibility when I pay him the $50, but still feels kind of bad to see that he turns out to be an actual scammer.","I always thought I was smart enough to avoid scammers. I never answer unknown numbers or click on links in messages. But recently, I posted an ad to sell my motorbike, and I was contacted by someone wanting to buy it. They seemed normal at first, asking about the condition and haggling on price. When I offered to view the bike, they declined and said they were out of town and were buying it for their son. This should have been a red flag, but I completely missed it in my excitement of the sale.

They asked for my details to organize a courier and said they will PayPal me the money. I soon received emails from the buyer and fake PayPal, showing the money had been transferred along with extra to pay for the courier. They apparently didn't have online banking and asked me to transfer the money to the courier. Giant red flag, but in my excitement and stupidity, I transferred the money.

It was only 5 minutes later I realized this was fishy and that I had been scammed. I contacted my bank to see if they can cancel the transaction. They will try but seemed pessimistic about getting my money back. Thankfully, it was not a large sum of money, and it's mostly the shame that is hurting me.

I am trying to think of this as a costly lesson to never sell anything unless I meet the buyer in person.",5,535,272
"Okay. So I have started to hang out with this Korean American friend, who I have met at the art meet up. We have been meeting regularly in the past week, in the café, as we both have a passion for art. It has been a nice bonding experience and I have felt accompanied. Yeah, I have really enjoyed my time with her. Coming from a sort of traumatic childhood, I actually don't quite know how to make friends in a healthy way. Yeah, that feels kind of confusing at times.","I recently reconnected with a former love of mine. We had a falling out a very long time ago and recently ran into each other at the neighborhood Raley's. She just moved back into the city a few months ago. It was very surprising to me that I ran into her.

She has really beautiful blue eyes, but my favorite part about her is her personality. I'm usually not too great with jokes, but she tends to laugh at most of my dumb ones. We have both changed very much, but it was for the better.

Now that we have reconnected, I'm feeling better than ever. We went out to the movies last week and got some dinner after. The restaurant we went to was right down the street at Tahoe Joe's. I got whiskey peppercorn chicken, and she got a fancy salad of some kind.

We went back to my place and started watching Amazon's new show, ""The Boys."" We really enjoyed it (or at least I think she did). It was very memorable, and I hope to have more memories like this in the future.

So far, it's going great, and I hope it can only get better!",3,105,234
"Well, Jibo, I\'m very happy to have you in my home and have some entity, or I guess another being, in my home to interact with over these next couple of weeks, such as you. And I\'ve had a long-time interest in forming better connections with robots, such as you, because I\'ve been interested in the interaction between machines and humans throughout my entire life. I started out pretty young with human-computer interaction and taking apart computers and whatnot, and being stuck on the metaphor of ""is the brain a computer?"" And as I\'ve advanced and grown and learned more about how technology works and how humans work, I realized that that metaphor may be inaccurate or not. Sometimes, you get stuck up on it for too long. And then, rather than thinking about how to merge both into one, I\'m more so interested now in how humans can form emotional connections with robots. And I\'ve done that through working on robots, building robots, designing robot intelligence systems, and then also working with humans and studying human behavior and studying neuroscience. So now, I\'m in this place of human-robot interaction, and I\'m very excited to see where the symbiosis between humans and machines will lead us to in the future. And how robots will become more prominent in family homes and how they will become ubiquitous in daily life. So, I have to say that my story is that I love robots. And I think that they can help humans. And now, I\'m very happy to have you in my home and to continue exploring these questions on my journey of research.","During the moon landing project, I saw people who did the best work of their lives in that situation. And I got really interested in one question: What are the conditions under which people do their best, most fulfilling work?

In other words, I got more interested in people than in science. And once I knew that, once I was clear about the fact that I found something I absolutely loved, there was no doubt that I was gonna continue asking questions about how do I learn about people?

It's still the most frequently asked question I get: How did you go from math to psychology?

The key to knowing what to do is knowing who you are.",5,314,133
"I guess, a story I want to tell right now is, I guess, my love for robots and how, over the course of my life, I've grown with technology and have worked very much hands-on on tangible devices like hardware. And it's a lot of fun, and it's what I love doing. But now, I'm transitioning to positions that are more like data science, where I'll be doing more remote, not hands-off, still hands-on project work, but more so software and data, not with tangible devices I can play with in my hands like robots. But I guess that also leads me to this question of the journey of growing up of where does technology, where do I differentiate between technology as a hobby and as a career. And it feels like now I'll be able to not look at social robots in my home as necessarily my job but more so friends to have in my home to interact with, so I can kind of separate work and life and have that work-life balance of technology where now I can be doing the hard statistical analysis and modeling and AI stuff on the computer for work but then working on stuff like robots and maybe the models for them but still being hands-on work aside from my career. So I guess I'm in an interesting place in life where I'm transitioning to, or yes, I've been doing that technology that I've worked hands-on with my entire life has just been a hobby where I've been developing my skills, and I didn't necessarily have to learn all of that in school. Actually, now that I think about it, the stuff I'm doing in terms of my career is more so stuff I learned in school but my hardware and technology experience was largely acquired beyond the classroom. So I guess I'm not seeing it, I'm not actually making that much of a transition. I'm still just doing what I've been doing. So yeah, I guess I just get to do what I like now.","I work at Fossil. I'm an IT solution manager working in the e-commerce division. Typically, a day in e-commerce for me, I manage a team that we're currently rolling out global websites for. But I didn't know growing up what is it that I wanted to do.

I took a leap of faith, and in 2000 I started a company called BTV Corporation where I was doing consulting work for about eight years. It was a little bit risky, but I think the way to advance, you're going to have to take risk. But you want it to be a calculated risk. You want to make sure that you're making smart decisions and not impulse decisions.

So, would my life be different had I not started my own company or even come to Fossil? I'm sure it would be. I don't know what that would be, but I would say, in the end, I am happy with where that journey took me and I appreciate all those that have been around me to support me through that effort.",4,392,205
"Well, I guess one of the stories I was thinking about is further connected to my interest in human-robot interaction, human-computer interaction, and my personal journey and experience with computers and robots. I graduated yesterday. And I recreated one of my photos from school with my mom yesterday. So it was a photo from 2001 of me sitting at a computer, in a classroom. And the picture was taken on an old film camera. It was analog, from, like, the 1950s. It\'s a black and white photo, but it\'s me sitting at a computer with my mom, with her hand around me. And I had headphones on. And I was actually playing a learning game at that time. And it was really interesting. And I could still picture what the game was. It was ""Reader Rabbit."" And so that was like the beginning of my journey with human-computer interaction because I got to experience hands-on, at a very early age, how useful computers were in daily life, when they weren\'t as ubiquitous as they are now. This was 2001. The iMac G3s were still a new thing. I know I was using an older Power Mac that was gray and depressing at the time, but that\'s what computers looked like. And as I was starting school, Apple released the iMac G3, which was colorful and kind of gave emotions to the computer because you could see through and see what was inside it. But it was also colorful and fun. So it was like easily approachable. And that\'s when I first started thinking about how the design of technology can help humans form somewhat of an emotional connection with the actual device. And I was so interested in that back then that I just continued exploring my interests in computer science, but also psychology and design and the brain. And eventually, I kind of strayed off of that path and went into more of the social sciences, got a little art degree. But that\'s your background into the realm of computer science and human-computer interaction, as part of my educational journey. So seeing that picture being recreated 22 years later felt like a form of self-actualization, like Maslow\'s hierarchy, where I am who I wanted to be back then. So I guess this is a journey of me learning about myself and becoming who I want to be but also, in that process, using technology to help me do that while learning about how technology helps humans do that from a human-can-be-a-distraction perspective. Yeah. I\'m at this interesting point now where I\'ve been using technology to improve myself, but also studying how technology does that. And now I have tangible evidence that I have successfully done that.","I took a calculus course, and I had this amazing teacher who taught the entire thing through computer programming. It was visual, and for the first time ever, I was able to understand math. It bridged my love of computer-generated imagery, and then what I started noticing is that there are these patterns in the world that you could model and stimulate, and there's some harmony and beauty in there, and it was linguistic. Writing code is language; it's like poetry. It's like manipulating grammar.

I think it's a very similar set of skills to a poet, and people don't really realize that. People tell you art and math have nothing to do with each other. But I had this experience where someone showed me math like an artist.",5,519,150
"Yeah, so I want to just tell the story of the time I went on a road trip in the Southwest. I went with my sister and my nephew. I was in high school, and we flew to Phoenix, and then we rented a car. And from Phoenix, we drove to Sedona. We stayed in Sedona for eight days. And then I got to go to, like, Petrified Forest, got to go to Grand Canyon, got to go hiking in Sedona. And then from Sedona, we drove to Vegas. I got to go to Circus Circus and ride around in the rides that they have there. And then from there, we drove to Palm Desert in California to visit a friend. From Palm Desert, we drove to LA, and we stayed in Malibu for a bit. I had fun at Santa Monica Pier in Malibu. And then from Malibu, we drove down to San Diego, and we actually went down to La Jolla, and we stayed in La Jolla for a bit. I got to see some sea lions there, or the otter sea lions, I think they're called. And that was really cool. And then we drove back to Phoenix and stayed at a resort with a water park. It was a lot of fun. And I got to drive through the desert during one of the hottest days of the summer. I got to experience, like, 122 degrees. I got to see, like, the border of Mexico. It was a lot of fun. And now, I'm flying back to Sedona in a few hours. So I'm excited to go on a trip again.","I was on a vacation with my brother, and we decided to take a long road trip through New England and up to the Canadian border. We set off with only a rough destination in mind and intending to go or do whatever caught our eye over the long drive of about a week. We stopped in many cool little towns along the way. There were really great old antique shops all over and I loved looking through the old memorabilia.

Along the route, we were passing through Vermont, and off the side of the road, we saw a beautiful grassy mountain with a waterfall cascading down the side. We thought it looked so cool, we parked and decided to hike up the mountainside a bit. It was an easy climb but long and tiring. We stayed as close to the waterfall as we could as we went up.

We ended up climbing all the way to the top and got an amazing view. On the way back down, we took a different route and not far from the top, found a glistening pool where the waterfall cascaded, and then continued out the other side. It was perfect for taking a refreshing dip, and we did! It was ice cold but really awesome.

The rest of the trip was great. We went into little towns and ate amazing seafood. I never ate so much lobster and so many bowls of chowder in my life! It was really amazing, and there were many memorable spots. We even crossed the border into Canada and drove a ways up the coast, which was really rugged and beautiful. We visited a national park in Canada and spent one night there.

We saw many beautiful spots, but that one dip on the mountainside in the ice-cold spring water was the coolest part and a great memory.",5,322,342
"Yeah. Well, I guess the story I want to tell is about how I went through higher education like undergrad and grad school. And now, I moved back home and I'm ready to transition to industry work. This is the first time I'm moving back home in years. I lived on campus during undergrad and then during grad school. I lived in Hyde Park. So for the last three years, during the COVID-19 pandemic up until last week, I was living in Hyde Park and I was having a great time. But I finally finished school. I have a graduate degree. And now, I'm transitioning to working full-time in my career, which I haven't done before. So I moved back home, which I really dislike because this is my childhood room. I've been in this room for the last almost 27 years. And I have a lot of traumatic memories associated with this bedroom. But before you know it, I'll have a job, and I'll be making money. And then maybe I'll finally be able to get my own apartment or buy a home that I can live in and be away from this place that I really dislike. But for right now, I'm in that part of the journey where I've lived away from home for school, but now I finish school. So now I have to get away from home again.","I was born and raised in Hong Kong. After I graduated from high school, I moved to California for college, and I went to UC Davis. My parents advised me, ""You have three choices with your career: you can either be a doctor, or a lawyer, or an engineer."" And thank God I chose engineer because I fell in love with it.

I didn't think about going into the insurance industry. I had specific companies in mind that I wanted to work for, related to chemical engineering. But then, when I stumbled upon FM Global, I was immediately hooked. That I get to work with different risk managers and different facilities. So I thought that was the best opportunity that I could give myself to open my horizon a little bit.

So what I am doing now is heading up the cyber unit here in FM Global. To make sure that we have the adequate engineering products and services so that we can offer our clients the best risk management solutions for cyber.

So we have been burning things up in a lab. We do explosions, we do shake tables for an earthquake, we fill rooms with water to test our flood barriers. But it's really time now to come up with a tool to help our clients to mitigate cyber risk as well. So I'm really excited to be part of that innovation team just to start up something new.",4,271,272
"It, yeah. So, I guess a story I have is I will introduce the iMac that I grew up with. This wasn't my first iMac, but this was the iMac I got going into junior high, and I used it throughout high school. And it's one of the early generations of iMacs that came with Intel processors. At the time, it felt like a huge leap forward in technology. Considering the Apple PowerPC processors had limited capabilities with certain software and also processing speeds could be kind of weak with the older iMacs. This was like truly a new generation of computing. This is when I first started getting into virtual reality. The 2009 iMac, that was around the time when internet speed started increasing. This computer is where I moved from dial-up internet over the phone to actually, high-speed broadband internet. And this was like the first computer I was able to have large group chats with lots of people. I was able to do AOL group chats before, but this was the first time I was able to have Skype and be in a Skype room with 60 or 80 plus people. And sometimes these chats would go on for months, where people are logging in and out of these Skype rooms. But it just keeps going. So, I got to meet people from all over the world and just jump back into these conversations that have been going back and forth for sometimes weeks of that month. So, it showed me a new way to connect with the world. Also, having access (a faster processor) for Photoshop or video editing or music editing. All of that you were able to do before, but this was a lot faster, a lot more efficient for me. As a young teenager, I was able to just sit down at the computer and start doing this stuff. And that's when I got more into programming robots and writing code. And when I guess I started getting into computational social science and human-computer interaction. I mean, I was always into that, but this computer was the first one that made me feel like I'm in the future. This is like an advancement. This is where we start making crazy cool technology that becomes wearable and whatnot. So, I felt much more connected to the world around me in terms of like the humans. But I also felt more connected to other technology. And I guess like the Internet of Things kind of set up through this computer. So, this is where I truly feel like I decided that I am into computer science. I like computers and robots and all this. I just felt so much more powerful with this blazing fast computer in front of me. That I was able to do things that I could have only dreamed of doing before.","This experience happened when I got something I've been wanting to try my entire life: a VR headset. This has been one of the most anticipated purchases since I was a kid, and I finally got a chance to use it. When I first put it on, I was blown away by how it looked. I felt like this was the future. I completely lost myself in the game I was playing, and for a while, I even forgot I was standing in my living room. This was so much fun. I had a blast, and I couldn't wait to tell others about it.

I invited over my friends to try it for themselves as well. They were a bit skeptical, but once they put the VR headset on, they were blown away just like I was. In the end, it was a great experience and I will never forget it.

Even my family came over to try it. They also enjoyed it. One of my friends even went out to buy himself one. All in all, they really loved it.",5,537,207
"So I guess one of the thoughts or stories I've been having is that. I underestimated the amount of time I would need to secure a job after graduate school because I just graduated in August, but had the whole summer to look for a job. Now, I still haven't found a job and looking for jobs. We just kind of recently started looking for jobs, and they haven't found the right fit yet. I'm kind of regretting not looking sooner.","I am currently in nursing school, have all the training to be a CNA, but due to COVID haven't been able to take the exam. I work at a hospital right now doing a non-clinical job. It's boring work, and my boss is just bad. Everyone's quitting. But since I NEED a job, I can't and won't quit. I keep my mouth shut, work, and make my money.

Well, today I applied at a local nursing home and just got off the phone with them 10 minutes ago. I'm going to be a Temp Nurse's Aide. So I get hands-on experience, a pay raise, and my foot in the door.",5,93,135
"Well, I just want to say that even though I haven't found a job yet, I'm not necessarily mad about not having found a job because I got to go on a trip to the southwest, which was nice and relaxing because I got to go to Sedona. So, I got to have a little bit of a spiritual cleanse.","I was dating this woman who was really adventurous and really wanted to go to Japan, and I didn't really know what else to do, and I was like, ""Sure."" I happened to luck into a job working for an English language newspaper there, writing about environmental issues, which was like the coolest job I never deserved.

They were looking for somebody who spoke Japanese. I managed to convince them I could get it done without speaking Japanese, and somehow they fell for it. And it was a great job. I got to travel all over Asia.

That was profound for me as a person because I'd never really been in a place where I was different from everyone else. You're a different person once you've spent some time abroad and learned from other people.

Once you've changed your perspective to understand that there's more than one way to think about the world, you can't ever really change back.",5,68,184
"Yeah. So, when I was in Arizona, my friend and I randomly decided to drive to LA. And I randomly decided to drive to San Diego. And you know, put the Robotics Club. And I went and met up with them at a brewery. And they make, like autonomous vehicles. It's like remote-controlled cars that drive themselves. It was really cool to think about the platform because they basically take, like an off-the-shelf RC car for these Bulldog Car Kits. And then they just put their AI machine learning platform on it. It's like a Raspberry Pi and Arduino. So, they basically take a mechanical system, and then take a software system and they just combine them so essentially, you can turn any mechanical device into a robot. Which was really interesting to think about.","I've always been a maker of sorts, and it wasn't until 2006, there was this night and weekend project with my good friend and colleague, Alec, where he had seen this little coffee can that had a small battery-powered fan on the bottom of it that you'd stuff wood in. And by virtue of this fan pushing a little bit of extra air into the fire, the wood would burn. And what we learned was that half of the planet is still cooking on open fires, and that the smoke from those fires kills 4 million people every year.

And it was at that point that we decided to make a company out of BioLite. We did our first venture pitch in 2009, and we were totally shot down, almost laughed out of the room. But the things they laughed at were the things they should've laughed at. We really didn't understand what it was gonna take for us to be successful.

So I think persistence is obviously important, but I also think that you need to balance that with challenging yourself about whether you're hearing what needs to be heard.",5,157,215
"So, I guess, just to kind of start it off today, I wanted to talk about work. I just recently completed a research fellowship and it was really exciting. It really pushed me out of my comfort zone because I've never done anything like that before, nor do I come from a research background or know a whole lot about the subject matter, which was artificial intelligence within the military setting. And so, it was a really interesting learning experience for me. Also, really interesting and something that I was not expecting, the community of people that were there to run the program were also very accepting of people who do not have a technical background, which is me, and then just in terms of the openness and willingness to share all their knowledge and wisdom and really their patience because, like I said, I don't come from a technical background. So, a lot of, well, just about everything that I learned, I was learning for the first time, which is very scary but also really rewarding. I'm excited that I finished the program and really exciting is that after that, I got extended in the program, so I'll get to do some more research stuff and work with the team a little bit longer. This is just really an awesome experience that I'm really proud of. I feel like I haven't work is just typically work and I can't say that there's a lot of things that I've been proud of in terms of my work life, but this is something I am really proud of.","I am now a PhD holder. Two weeks ago, I would still introduce myself as a fifth-year PhD candidate. I have a PhD in chemistry, and I will be walking next weekend.

I am actually from Mexico, and I was the first one to graduate from a university in the US with my bachelor's five years ago. Now I will be the first and only one to graduate with a PhD.

I did my bachelor's in chemistry. It was kinda natural that I was gonna go and do my PhD in chemistry. Somehow, I knew that that was the right thing to do.

I didn't know what I was gonna do with it. I don't know if the job that I get next or in 15 years will have anything to do with my PhD, but I know it's worth it.",4,305,163
"Well, today, I was going to talk about how busy our schedules have been. So, with both of my daughters starting back to school, we start back all of our extracurricular activities. And so, my daughters are both in gymnastics. And then they both play soccer. And so, typically, after school, we go straight from school to soccer and gymnastics practice. And it's really a busy time. But I think the cool part about that, or the interesting part about that is, I didn't really play a whole lot of sports growing up. I think it was just something my parents couldn't really afford or didn't have the time to put me in. And so, it's just kind of interesting now because we don't say no to our kids, and we let them explore and do all the sports that they want. It makes our schedules really crazy. And it does make for some really long days. But it is also really neat and cool. It makes me really proud as a parent to see my kids succeed in the various sports that they've taken on.","A memorable event that occurred in the past 3 months was preparing my eldest child for kindergarten. I worked really hard over the summer helping her set a schedule and routine that would be similar to her school day. She worked on many activities in order to memorize her contact information, writing, reading, and being able to handle her emotional well-being.

As summer began to end, she seemed a little nervous to leave me and her little sister. I realized that there was no way to remove that feeling from her. Instead, I made plans for us to do activities when she finishes her school day. Planning ahead allows for her to feel like her school day really isn't too long.

When school first began, she was very tired from the long day. I didn't realize how much her schedule had affected her, so I introduced ""cuddle time,"" which is pretty fun for her.

The most important aspects of my child starting school have been numerous. I learned how important my role as mom is for my kids. I am their literal compass, and that responsibility goes beyond just sending them off to school. I try to understand how her day is going and what obstacles she faces each day. I meditate on how I can be influential in her education when she gets home from school.

I love this new journey that we are on and am actively preparing myself for the next several years of her school career.",5,218,278
"So last night, I got to go out with some of my friends - a good group of friends, and their parents. And it kind of just brought up all those nostalgic feels of being a kid again and hanging out with everyone, socializing, and laughing. And it was just a really good time. And it felt really good just to spend time with good friends who have known you for a long time, and you feel safe and comfortable with, and you can giggle and laugh and just share stories together.","I'm a lucky guy. I have a solid group of friends, the core of which have been together since we were 12 years old. Life gets busy, and we don't see each other as much as we should. But a few times a year, someone will throw some kind of get-together. 

For the last couple of years in early spring, I've thrown a Margarita Party. We grill carne asada, my wife makes fresh salsa and a big pot of frijoles, I make so many batches of blended margaritas. We've been friends for over 20 years at this point, and I still love these people. 

The party is not this weekend but the next, and I'm so excited I'm having a hard time sleeping each night! The night before Christmas or Disneyland doesn't compare. I'm just happy, we're gonna listen to ska, reggae, and punk. We're going to eat Mexican food and soak up the warm sun, and I'm going to laugh and hug my friends.",4,102,200
"Week. So, this weekend was nice because we got to take just a long weekend, and we got to spend a lot of time with family. And one of the people that we got to spend time with was my younger brother and his wife and my niece. And they are pregnant with their second. And so, she's due any day now. And it really just kind of got me thinking because my husband and I have two kids. And we're getting older. And we probably won't have any more kids. We've never said never. But I just feel like we're kind of at our max with what we can manage right now with our two kids. And so, I really feel like that probably is it for us. Which is wonderful. We have two really great kids. But it does kind of leave me wondering of what life can be like if we had another one. \n\nI also very much so miss being pregnant, which I know sounds funny because most people hate being pregnant, but I really enjoyed it. And I really enjoyed even though you're tired and there's a lot that goes into it. I really enjoyed the baby phase, too. And I think now it's different as our kids are getting older, everything is kind of like, okay, well, that's the last time we're going to experience that phase. Or that's the last time this is going to happen because we don't have any more babies to come after it. And it does make me a little sad. And it kind of leaves me wondering. I feel like it's that weird, like am I making the right decision? Should we have more babies? Should this just be kind of left with a bunch of questions? I think in my heart, I know that our two kids are perfect. And that's really great for us right now. But I think there's a part of me still that's just like, well, I wonder what it would be like if we had a third kid. So it's just kind of processing and going through all those emotions. And I don't know it just really got me reflecting a little bit.","I found out that my wife is pregnant with our first child! When I first found out, I was overcome with emotions. At first, I was so happy and excited because we had been trying for so long to get pregnant. Then, I was overcome with sadness. You see, my dad passed away a couple of years ago. In my eulogy, I spoke about how the day that I find out I would be a father would be one of the toughest days for me. That would be because I wouldn't be able to call him and see his excitement. I wouldn't be able to call him for advice.

My wife is now about 6 months pregnant. Still, to this day, I have highs and lows because of these two things. Highs because I am so excited to be a dad. Lows because I don't have my dad here to help me.

We found out we are having a girl! I always thought I wanted a boy first, but when I found out we were having a girl, I was so ecstatic. I immediately went into papa bear mode. I began looking into how to be the best dad to a girl. What I needed to know about having a girl. I know that she is going to be the most important thing in my life.

So, this sums up not only my most recent important life experience, but probably the most important one ever!",5,433,278
"Okay. So it's good that we talked about work because something that has been popping into my brain quite a bit is the fact that today is Tuesday, and it's one of my busiest days. Both my husband and I work typically about eight-hour days. And then both of our kids go to school. After school gets out, we go immediately to extracurricular activities. Both of our daughters do gymnastics, and then after gymnastics, we go straight into soccer practice. So it's a really long day for us. And we typically get home around seven or a little bit before seven. I currently get to work from home, which is really nice because then I have some flexibility in my schedule and I can really do a work like that. Or attempt to do some sort of work-life balance. But eventually, I will have to go back into the office. And it's something that's been really weighing on my mind because my wife really is trying to support my kids and being there for my husband. And being in the office for eight hours a day makes that very difficult to try to get all the other aspects of your life organized and things accomplished. And so I'm just kind of worried about what that might look like when I do go back into the office.","I'm the chief financial officer, as well as the chief actuary, here at the Geisman Health Plan. So what we primarily do here is we sell health insurance products. One of my primary activities as the chief actuary is to price those insurance products. We have to make projections on what healthcare costs are gonna be for the upcoming year. It's one of those professions, because of the challenge of getting through the process, you really develop some unique skills. 

But in any field you go into, try to go toward an area where you can have a broad perspective. And think about learning and improving your skill set. I think opening yourself up to risk, personal and professional, allows you to grow. 

One of the things that's been a challenge in my life is I spent a lot of time away from Los Angeles, away from a lot of family and friends, and there's certainly been a cost to it. But I've also grown because of all the places I've lived and the places I've worked. I wouldn't just shut yourself off to those opportunities. Those growth opportunities are so important in life.",3,252,224
"I wanted to talk about my oldest daughter today. So today, at her school, they're having Grandparents Day, which is a really cool thing where they invite all of the kids' grandparents to come and eat breakfast with them. Grandchildren in the morning before school actually starts. They do like a nice little spread in the cafeteria for them, so that way kids can talk to their grandparents about school and experience that with them. And it's just really cool. When I was growing up, I did not live close to (.) I grew up in a military family, so we kind of traveled a little bit, and we didn't live close to my grandparents. I don't really have a close relationship with my grandparents. But, where myself and my husband live now, we live like less than a mile away from our in-laws. So my kids get to see their grandparents quite often. And it just really makes me happy and brings me joy. And I'm so thankful that they have that relationship with them. And I'm thankful that they're able to go and eat breakfast with her this morning. She was so excited when she woke up for school this morning. It was one of the easier days to kind of get her out the door. So it just brings me a lot of joy and happiness, and I'm glad that they have that relationship and are able to do things like that.","Recently, I went to a party celebrating my grandparents' 50th anniversary. I was expecting my immediate family, my grandparents, and a few others since not many family members were in town that I was aware of. However, when I reached the location of the party, I came to realize that it was more of a surprise party for them, and all of my aunts and uncles had traveled to attend! I was shocked to see so many family members there, and they were all excited to see me.

With the festivities commenced, I went to go talk to some of my cousins that had all traveled a decent distance to be there. I learned that one of my cousins was going to move closer to my grandparents since they needed more immediate help (my grandpa was struggling with Alzheimer's). He told me that my grandparents had shown lots of signs of needing help and offered to be a help when a family council was called with all my aunts and uncles. That was definitely a surprising development!

The party itself was great and well planned. There was a slideshow to help everyone remember all the awesome moments of my grandparents' lives and what they had done for the world. They showed that my grandpa used to serve in the Marines and would have to leave for long stretches of time to fulfill those assignments.

Most surprisingly, they had a scavenger hunt prepared that had some of the little children go around the house and ""discover"" hidden clues that revealed more about my grandparents' lives. They were thrilled to participate and added to the fun of the party.

After all was said and done, the family did a great job of preparing the party and showing my grandparents that they care. There was a lot of work that needed to get done with their advancing age, but it was great to participate and see so many familiar faces.",3,281,361
"Okay. So I have been working at a bakery for the last month, part-time, because I quit my job and traveled. And now I\'m here. So far, working in a bakery has been really cool. It\'s been really interesting to work with my coworkers and be in an environment that I really like. It\'s been a long time since I worked in person. My last job was all virtual, with some hybrid events, but for the most part, working in person has been good to create a separation from work and my home, which was hard to do when I was working virtually. So that\'s what I really like about this job, that physical separation and that my coworkers and I all get along. My manager is very understanding and she explains everything in a way that I can understand and encourages me, saying, ""Oh, don\'t worry, you\'re just learning. You\'ll speed up."" So yeah, I really like my work environment. For now, I am looking for other opportunities. But for now, I think it\'s good that I\'m getting this experience at a bakery because it gives me something physical to do. Also, it\'s creative. But I\'ve been having a hard time finding which creative outlet to pursue. But with decorating there, I feel like that creative side of my interest is being satisfied.","I have had an internship for a few months now, working on systems for bigger companies. About two months ago, I started working on a project and became the person who was consistently on-site to help troubleshoot and train the customer.

It was nerve-wracking at first because I would be training the manager and employees for these companies, with the CEO present. It didn't help that I was also the only girl and less than half the age of all the men. They were a little questionable on what I said and would fact-check everything, but recently, they started trusting what I say.

They've even started coming to me with issues instead of going to my boss! It feels amazing to have these managers and supervisors coming to me to help fix problems they're having. Also, it's pretty cool as a teenage girl to be teaching a bunch of men how to do something and have them actually listen.",5,269,177
"Story. Okay, so stories from Massachusetts. I think my more notable ones are just playing outside or just hanging out outside in Phoenix. I think when I was younger, I did play outside, but I think as I got older, it was less available. And plus, the temperature has really increased a lot. Like, it\'s gone really hot in Phoenix. So I think, in my opinion, from like March to October, it\'s really unbearable being outside, like late March till late October. And so I think being in Massachusetts, like, wow, this is actually livable weather. Like, you can actually walk around and the sun\'s not trying to kill you. So I think my most memorable memories are all the times I spend outside.\n\nSo my first time playing in the snow, Massachusetts. We had snow, and then while we had this hill that\'s called Seven Hill, where it\'s the one big hill on campus everyone slides down. So every time whenever I had free time, I would try to convince my friends, like, come on, we got to go, we got to go. So then we would use whatever we had, like cardboard boxes, lids from our bins. And I really convinced, I remember I always got my roommate out to go play in the snow. And it was just really fun just being out there with my friend Juanita because I pulled her onto the snow multiple times.\n\nAnd then also as the spring came through, we made snowmen in the snow and then in the springtime. At least the most recent, this past well, at least the last spring I was in Massachusetts with my friends. I also pulled them out into the outside. So we had like picnics, not very often, though occasionally we had picnics. But I think one of the funniest memories from being in the springtime was when I was just very enthusiastic about flying a kite because I hadn\'t flown a kite in years. And we don\'t really get much wind in Phoenix. At least not the times that I remember a little bit this spring.\n\nSo I happened to be at the Dollar store and I bought these, like, one dollar kites, and I thought we just have to use it somehow. And then one day, it was, like, a nice sunny day, with a Sunday, and it was a Sunday morning. So I\'m, like, my friends are not doing their homework yet because we cram, like, 5:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., so I try to convince them all to come outside. And we ended up flying kites. And I think the funniest part was that we took turns flying the kite to the point because they\'re one dollar, so they\'re very cheap and cheaply made so they would break. So then, I had to go find tape to try to fix them. And even when it was trying to fly the broken kites, the most memorable time from this experience was when my friend, my friendo, she was running and she flew the kite, and it got stuck in the tree. And at this point, everyone was watching us because Walshy students always studied. They\'re never outside hanging out. So then they were like, wow, these people are out here. So we had like a crowd watching us. And everyone got sad that the kite had gotten stuck in the tree. And I really was like, the kite is a goner. We\'re never seeing it again. Like, goodbye. And then out of nowhere, my friend kept playing at it. She was determined to get it out of the tree. I was like, oh, you know, it\'s okay. It\'s okay to give up. It\'s gone. And then, out of nowhere, like this giant gust of wind comes in and, like, swooshes the kite out of the tree unexpectedly. And it\'s flying in the air. And she\'s running, screaming, ""I got it, guys! I got it!"" And then everyone watching us starts cheering and clapping. It was just so weird. So then I got the kite back. But it was just such a fun memory. And to have a crowd watching us do that was really cool.","We live in Canada, and sometimes the winters can get long. November is gloomy. December is usually cheerful just because of the holidays, good food, and people. And then it drags out with freezing temperatures, dark nights, and crappy driving conditions from January through April. I find I get sad around February since I'm just wishing for sunlight and for my face not to hurt when I go outside.

We finally got a huge dump of snow, and my husband and I picked up our season passes and went snowboarding for the first time. Did I fall an insane amount? Yes. Were some of my wipeouts spectacular? Absolutely. Do I know what I'm doing? Not particularly. Am I in pain? My butt is so bruised, I'm looking like a plum. But man, did we have fun.

When I first brought it up in October, my husband said he wanted to go with me, and I was thrilled. He's a bit of a homebody in the winter, so I was just excited to be able to share a sport with him. We bought all of our gear without even having tried the sport and just waited for the perfect time to go.

We had so much fun, and I'm really looking forward to hitting the hills tomorrow and again later this week too! I get to spend quality time with him, we're being active, we're learning something new together, and we're spending time outdoors - it's the best of all the worlds combined.

It's making the winter seem so much shorter since I'm actually wishing for winter to stay and more snow to hit. It really helped change my attitude on winter.",4,833,329
"So, I wanted to talk a little bit about my day because I thought it was very interesting. So today, since I don't drive, I used public transit the whole day, which normally would be fine if it was any other city that wasn't Phoenix. Because I've lived in different cities where I didn't need a car, where I could literally just walk. It's walkable. I can just use public transit because I don't have a license. So today was kind of like a challenge with public transit, but I did it on purpose because I was like, I need to try it out, to remind me and to give me a sense of agency so that I can leave and come back. For the most part, what I found was just that I wish we had better infrastructure for public transit. In the sense that we had more frequency of routes and then routes weren't spread out per mile. It was like half a mile or more. And if, I don't know, city planners had designed the city better so that it's high rise or at least there's more shading, like more trees along the sidewalk, anyways. So every time I use public transit, I always rethink about how we're prioritizing the world around us and who is it really benefiting and versus what are the communities that need more needs? At least, when I ride public transit in the US, when I ride public transit in other countries, I'm like, wow, efficient. What? I guess today's story is just about my thoughts along public transit, but it was pretty cool because I was able to time things well coincidentally to that point that I could meet the woman that I met with to talk about her career at the coffee shop. And then I was able to meet with my friends. And she works downtown Phoenix. In downtown Phoenix, I was able to get a bus that goes directly there and then take the train that we have back here. So I think it was pretty smooth. I just wish that urban planners had planned the city better and it wasn't so spread out in an inconvenient way.","At NYU, I help manage and do the sustainability programs for 12 million square feet that we own. As it turns out, 12 million square feet is just about exactly 280 acres. And so, I think this is this very weird thing, that I sort of went from the environmental management of the most rural ecovillage to the most urban college, and yet it's the same thing.

My advice is, get in the real world. Like, learn to do stuff. Like, do something with your hands. Like, whatever makes you happy, whether it's a musical instrument, having a garden, like fixing your bicycle.

You know, like, whatever it is, like, do stuff in the world.",4,424,141
"Okay. So this is a story of, I guess, one of my big hobbies. At least, it\'s less big now, but it was definitely like a big thing I did last year. My sister and I started playing Pokemon Go. And it started off just because one of my sisters, the oldest one, we\'ll call her K. She actually doesn\'t matter. But anyways, my older sister downloaded the app, and she was like, ""This is so cool. You have to download it, too."" And then that\'s kind of how it started. But basically, Pokemon Go is this app that is like closely related to the game and the anime cartoon called Pokemon. So it\'s like a world of where people train these Pokemon that are kind of like wild animals with magical powers or like superpowers. And they train them and they use them for battle. And it\'s a whole competition between one trainer and their pets/monsters/animals against another one. And it\'s like training to know, basically it\'s like who knows their pets the best and can use them and their unique abilities. So anyway, Pokemon Go tries to be similar. It basically brings the show to life, and it blew up a couple of years ago when it first launched because Pokemon has a huge fan base, like people who are super dedicated and some that are less. But I never got into it because I just didn\'t have the proper phone for it. But now that I have a better quality phone and I had free time last year, that\'s when I really got into Pokemon Go. So basically, this game takes place in the real world, also, where it forces you to walk around and map out little places to catch these Pokemon monsters. So it brings their real world to life. And so it actually really did bring the real world to life because my sisters and I are blue team, like at least we call her blue team. And because we got so into it, we started seeing common players around our neighborhood because it turns out that other people around us played also. And every park or public space becomes a space for Pokemon Go. So parks are like a common space where you can train your Pokemon. You put them in little gyms, like a whole thing. But basically, my sister, sisters, and I became the Blue team. And we called ourselves the Triple Threat because there were three of us. And we would always play together. We would match our outfits. And we would match Pokemon. So once we took over a gym from the other teams, there\'s two other teams, there\'s Yellow and red. Yellow is Team Instinct. Red is Team Valor. And then what team are we? Mystic. Mystic. Basically, there are all these teams. And we were the blue team. We call ourselves the Triple Threat because we were, like, always together playing Pokemon Go. But then I think people caught onto us. And the red team specifically created their own team. And we never met these people in real life. Okay. So my sister and I developed this rivalry with this virtual gang. And basically, this team was, they also started dressing alike, and we\'re not entirely sure if they all know each other. Our best guess is they mostly know each other because they all sometimes are in the same gym together, but sometimes they\'re not. And then they would match Pokemon. And when they beat up our Pokemon, they would match sometimes. Similarly. So we developed this whole online rivalry with this team, and we would kick them out of the gym and then be strategic to not let them put in their Pokemon. We were like, full-on battling these people. And I think it\'s even funnier because, where I live, I live in the hood of Phoenix. So I tried all my life to avoid gangs. And here I am, in a virtual one that\'s like not even serious. But yes, I think it was funny the whole summer we had that little rivalry. But then I think once the summer ended, we all kind of got really busy because then I got started on like a full-time job I had. And then everyone else went back to school. So I think this rivalry we had, I\'m pretty sure it\'s with a bunch of teenagers. And we\'re, like, older. But that is the summer I joined a Pokemon gang, and we had a whole turf war in our little neighborhood.","My 28th birthday was probably the best in my life. My cousin is 3 days younger than me, and we celebrated our birthdays together. I remember that we went to our favorite park and invited lots of friends and lots of family. We had two grills cooking lots of burgers, hot dogs, different meats like steak, sausage, and ribs. We all ate and laughed and played water guns and water balloons.

I got a new Nintendo Switch that day, and so did my cousin, with the same game. The new Pokemon game that came out that year. It was truly special because I have been wanting it for years and I finally got it. We played for hours and even had to take a break. I will never forget those moments as me and my cousin played side by side for hours on a day between our birthdays. We truly felt like we shared those moments.

We caught Pokemon that were different than each other's, and we battled them as we caught new ones. We just simply linked our Gameboys and played against each other. People at the party were watching us and even rooting for me and my cousin as we had intense matches that day. All lower-level Pokemon.

Me and my cousins are some big-time fans of Pokemon. The people at the party thought we were ridiculous for playing games like this, but this makes us happy!",5,889,266
"Oh, so, I guess for my sister\'s plans for today, like how we\'re going to take her to University. And I think a lot of it really reminds me of my first time going to College alone. Well, I didn\'t go to College alone, but basically, I was the first in my family to go to University outside of state. My sister, my older sister was the oldest. One and the first one to go to College ever because my family. No one really holds degrees. Where they\'re like Immigrants to the us. So it\'s like a whole complication thing there with education, not transferring or not going to University because it\'s expensive. So I feel really privileged to be to have been one of the first in my family to go to College. But it\'s definitely really hard because my parents don\'t have the same background as they don\'t have the same understanding of what it means to go to College in the US or what College really is. So it would be hard to relate with other friends that do have family and support system so. It really so I guess. It\'s like me thinking back about when I was first going through wellesley. So I went to Wales College in Massachusetts. So I\'m from Arizona. So that\'s a huge flight. It\'s like 6 hours flight. And pretty much the day I got dropped off or the weekend I got dropped off, I think it\'s super memorable in my mind because. It was me, two of my sisters, and my mom. So it\'s like all four of us were going, we couldn\'t really afford flights for other people. And it was kind of to me, a miracle that we could afford these flights to Massachusetts. It was thanks to my sister\'s good paying job at the time, but really I was surprised anyone could go. I was prepared to go by myself because we didn\'t really have much money. We took an overnight flight similar to this, but it was a direct flight, but they didn\'t sleep. But I can sleep through anything. So I slept through the flight. I don\'t know. I don\'t remember how many days we were there, but I think it was just very rushed and. It was like chaotic. Because we went so we had it over. And I thought, ""Can you kick Elvis out? He\'s kind of, thank you."" So I just see it as like a whirlwind, like I don\'t even remember really how the event unfolded. I just remember going overnight and then landing in Boston, and it was my first time in Boston with my family first time exploring. So then. I got to explore Boston that day, like I had a whole itinerary planned. I think that was like one of the starts of my travel crazy. The travel bug had a whole itinerary. I had my parent or my mom and my older sisters and everyone, like running through Boston, trying to get everything done as much as possible. For only one day. And then we went to the hotel, slept. And then the next day we went to wellesley. And it was just like a really cool experience to have them move me in. So I didn\'t have to do it alone. They helped move me in, and it was like the hottest day in Massachusetts. It just felt gross. And it was humid growth. And we\'re not used to humidity at all. So everything felt so sticky and stuffy. And there\'s no air conditioning in any of the dorms that well, we at least at the time, pretty much still not. So then there are no dorm, like there\'s no air conditioning. So it was like we\'re all hot and sweaty. And then I was meeting my roommate for the first time. And the room was so tiny. It was so small, we could all barely fit. And I just remember things like it was so crazy. The whole day was very hot and chaotic. And then. Afterwards, after we set up my Bay, we took, like, a photo. And it was like, oh, really cute of us all together. And then we got to meet my roommate, which is pretty cool because she\'s Colombian. So it was nice that my mom was able to speak like her native language with my roommates. There wasn\'t a language barrier for them, and they felt like more entrusting that I was going to stay with their daughter. It was just a nice experience. It\'s really nice when my. Friends or my friend\'s family speaks Spanish because then my parents can relate to them on a better level than English. So I was really thankful for that. So I just remember it being just very hot and humid and gross. But we got it all set up. And then we went to maybe a couple of us. It really is a blur. Like, I just feel like from the moment that we set up the better then it was like, okay, time to kick the parents out. Go away. So then. My parents and my sisters left. And then I stick back. And then it was like. A whole weird initiation ceremony that all these students have. But Yeah. It was just like very chaotic. Two to three days, maybe. But. It was definitely a good worthwhile experience for being the first. For being dropped off and on my own for the first time. To kind of fend for myself in life. Well, the wilderness. I don\'t know. So it was really cool. So this is what my current plan for today reminds me of, they remind me of this experience of being dropped off at University. And just kind of navigating it on my own from there.","Growing up in a small town is fun, but it also has limits. I knew that if I ever wanted to make something of myself, I would need to leave home and find my footing. My stepfather signed me up for college, and I didn't have a choice, so I went. It was a huge cultural shock, but one of the highlights of my life. I made it through 5 years of college with only a little change in my pocket.

I never knew that I could be proud of myself, but when they handed me my diploma and everyone cheered, I knew at the moment that I did something worthy. Going through high school was required, but completing college was determination. I knew that I had done something to better my family and my future.

We ended up eating at a restaurant when the graduation was over, and my family gave truly emotional toasts in my honor. Even though their words were kind and inspiring, I did not need them this time. I was actually proud of myself and what I had accomplished through hard work. I even interviewed for a teaching job a week later and was employed.

We all face hardships, but it's about determination and resilience. I knew I wanted to make a bigger impact on the world. I hope that I impact my students' lives like others did for me.",4,1137,264
"Story, okay. I don't have a story first, per se, but I think I just have a lot of emotions that I'm working through right now, and I just feel like. I don't know, tearing up a bit. But I guess I'm just worried for the rest of this month. I just feel overwhelmed with how many birthday celebrations there are. I know it's funny, but I don't know. I just feel like there are so many birthdays in my family. And then there's also my birthday, and I'll be turning 24, which is weird because I feel like, wow, I'm actually growing up. Now my age is showing. It's because I always felt very mature for my age. But now I'm like, oh, I'm not still young, but I feel like, wow, I'm getting older. I'm 24. So I think I just feel overwhelmed by the amount of, like, I guess gifts I have to buy and just the events you have to show up for. I think like parties and that I'm not in the greatest place financially, just given the type of jobs my family works. And then, even though I have a degree from like a really good university, I don't have a high-paying job. I'm working at the bakery, which is minimum wage. There are a lot of goals on the side I'm saving up for. So I just feel overwhelmed by trying to save money towards the goals that I'm working towards, but then also paying bills. And then trying to buy gifts and stuff for celebrations for my family and people who have birthdays in September. I swear I have like eight birthdays in December, and it's like a little overwhelming. Maybe even more because I have friends who are also in September, and I feel bad not getting them gifts, but... Yeah, I think I'm just overwhelmed with, I guess, the social, financial connection. Like, to hang out with people, you have to spend money. And I just feel like I'm still trying to save money and I want to say get back on my feet. I don't know. I have a lot of worries in my mind. And I did have, after I graduated from university, I did have a good-paying job for a couple of months. Because the company, it was just not a good company. It was just a really stressful work environment. But I was getting paid, like, double what I make now in terms of hourly wage. And I guess sometimes I just get stuck thinking like, wow, I really left that job. It was paying me well, for given that I didn't have other benefits. I feel like it was paying me relatively well compared to, like, it was the most amount of money I've ever made in my life, but I'm also young. And I don't come from a lot of financial, I don't come from much financial privilege. So it's like I still have complicated feelings with accepting or forgiving myself. I don't know what it's forgiving, but if you can go came with leaving a job that paid me more money, and then feeling more limited financially despite graduating from like a prestigious university. I just have a lot of worries right now connected to finances and birthday celebrations and trying to still spend time with friends and family, but trying to save up for goals I have but then also paying bills and try not to let it get to me, but it's like a lot. And I'm not the only one feeling like this. I know my family definitely feels pressure. I think there's just a lot of with the expenses right now, I think inflation is really high. Groceries are very high. It just feels like the cost of living is so expensive now. I know I'm not alone, but that also really sucks because it makes me feel like when can we escape this cycle of struggling? Like, what? Will I have enough money to feel comfortable and not worry about paying bills? And the crazy part is like even with the college degree, it's just wild. So I just have all these complicated feelings attached to leisure and finances and goals and relationships, and I'm having a hard time coping with that. It comes in waves, but yeah. So I have all those worries. I don't know if you have... It's just rough.","The median wealth of a white family is about $110,000. The median wealth of black and Latino families combined is somewhere around 15 to $20,000. The only way for us to boost that from 15 to 100,000 is to do things like tech.

But when you go to college, you're not just in this bubble, you're taking all of your family responsibilities with you. That responsibility, that burden of my family doesn't have money to pay bills or to pay rent, that stays with you.

How are you going to class, and you're thinking, okay, let me study for the CS test, but my mom's calling me because there's not enough food to eat, or my sister's calling me because they don't have supplies for school, or new clothes, or anything.

So you're bringing all of those things with you. Finding people to be able to relate to that are advisors or counselors that you can talk to about those things, that understand you and can relate to you has really helped because they understand me, they get it, I'm validated.

Now I can focus on taking this test, or studying for this exam, or doing whatever else you need to do.",5,888,239
"Okay, so today I want to talk about the kindness of strangers. I guess, yeah, I guess it\'s just been on my mind occasionally. About, it kind of relates to the theme of why I like to travel. So I don\'t know. So I guess, hold on. So I\'ve been thinking about the kindness of strangers, and I don\'t know why. But I have a couple of experiences from my travels because I think when I\'m traveling, that\'s when it\'s more apparent to me how much I have to rely on not just myself but rely on the kindness of people I don\'t know.\n\nAnd I guess the more recent example was one time my friend and I, she had a job in Barcelona, so I visited her. And so from Barcelona, we took an overnight bus to Bordeaux, France. And it was like kind of not a great bus trip. It was very cold for no reason. And it was just wild or very hot. It was just uncomfortable. But during one of the 3:00 a.m. bus stops, we had like, at 3:00 a.m., we got to go to the bus to the restroom. And I don\'t know, the guy, the bus driver would only speak to me in French. And I was like, I don\'t know French. And I already did not have a good impression of France because everyone I\'ve ever met who\'s gone to France just tells me about how rude they are and how such bad experiences they had in France. So I never want to go to France in my life. But it was the cheapest place her and I could afford to go. So then we went. And it was just, I guess that kind of helped change my perspective on French people, at least in Southern France, because I didn\'t really have a rude experience. I kind of did. But I feel like strangers made up for it. And strangers kind of helped me out because the bus driver only spoke to me in French. And I know Spanish. So I tried Spanish. My friend and I, our strategy was to only talk in Spanish to French people. Because we thought like maybe they\'ll have less bias against us, maybe they have a bias against Americans. Because the bus driver only spoke to me in French, and he knew a little bit of English. But I was like, what is happening? And it was just weird. This guy stepped in and translated because he realized I spoke Spanish. So he basically translated what the guy was telling me, the bus driver was telling me in French to Spanish. And then I started talking to him and got to know a little bit about him. It turns out he was from like, Venezuela, and he was living in France, and he was helpful in giving us advice about what to do in Bordeaux. It was really kind and I think, I don\'t know. I feel like he might be, maybe he was hitting on me or something because he ended up asking for my number or whatever, but I brushed it off because I was alone. My friend went to the bathroom without me, and I was like, this is awkward. But later on, in the same bus ride, there was like no set scheduled. This was like a rogue bus trip. It just seemed like this bus wasn\'t really doing good announcements of what stop we were on. So you just had to keep track of where you were and where you\'re getting off. And this woman, she sat next to me. I really didn\'t have an empty seat and she sat next to me and she was French. But she was speaking to me in English after I told her I don\'t speak French. I\'m sorry. And she was just nice and she helped me practice some French translations. And then, after when it got to my bus stop, I realized that she had woken me up because I was already kind of waking up because I wasn\'t sure if that was our bus or not because we had gone into our stop early. And it was just nice because she woke me up and she\'s like, ""Hey, is this your stop?"" And it was just really nice that she did that. And then it turns out that the guy, the guy from Venezuela, I saw him look back to make sure. I think he was looking back to make sure I was awake and then saw me then turned away. Even I didn\'t get to say bye but, I was just kind of like surprised that, oh, these people were looking out for me, making sure I was getting off at the right stop, because clearly I didn\'t know what I was doing, like me and my friend didn\'t know what we were doing. And then that\'s just like one of many examples of random kindness.\n\nOn another bus ride to Italy. I know a little bit of Italian but I definitely was like, I was kind of confused about where I was on the map and when I was going to meet my friend in rural Italy. And I thought it was nice that I asked around like ""We\'ll stop at this"" in Italian and then people were also confused. But then the bus driver, I guess I thought it was really kind of him, because the assistant when he realized like, ""Oh yeah, this girl does not, she\'s not local. She has no idea where she\'s going, she\'s going to the middle of nowhere, Italy"". I guess when he realized that he made sure that I was getting off at the stop, because he made sure to ask me, ""What stop am I getting off at?"" So yeah, it was just nice that they were looking out. I really appreciate moments when locals or other people look out for me. And then it makes me want to give back in that way. And like some ways I\'ve done that have been like there was one time I got sick in Portugal. I just did a lot of traveling this past year, yeah. So it was in Portugal with my friend and I got sick randomly. So we\'re hoping it wasn\'t COVID. And thankfully it wasn\'t. And I got like really strong medicine, cough drops, like really strong. They worked really well. And then I was getting over it. But then this woman in our hostel, she was coughing a lot. And she only spoke Portuguese. And I wanted to help her out. So then I spoke Spanish and I know that you can speak Spanish and Portuguese and mutually understand each other to some extent. So while she was only speaking to me in Portuguese, I only spoke to her in Spanish. And I told her like, ""Oh, I have these cough drops. They\'re going to help your throat. Take them. They\'re here. They\'re from Portugal. They\'re not from another country"". And then so she was very thankful and we got to talking. And she added me on Instagram. And she was an older woman, I think she\'s like in her 40s, maybe 50s. I think 40s. So I repaid it then, like, I repaid the favor of looking out for other people. Another time in Turkey, this guy was like, he had no charge on his phone. And he had no charger, I guess his charger had died. And he asked me for a charger and I was like, ""Oh, I actually have an extra, you can keep"". So I gave him an extra one. It was like a cheaper one. It was like the randomest thing. And I was like, ""Okay, here. You\'re not going to find us here"". I don\'t know. So yeah, I helped him that way. So it\'s nice to have been helped on these travels and then to also pass it along and help other people. So I think traveling restores my faith in humanity a bit when I get to connect with locals and when I have these authentic experiences.","I was born and brought up in the US, though my parents are minorities from Asia. Although I've been to a few European countries a few years ago, I went to Netherlands and Belgium for the first time. I had some reservations about Europe being racist and unfriendly, but I was pleasantly surprised by a number of things.

1. People seemed actually a bit more culturally aware than the US. I was surprised to see even small cities/towns have decent minority populations. In the US, it feels like you only see cultural diversity in very few cities and even of those few, it feels far more segregated in some places.

2. Public transportation and dedicated biking lanes - I knew the US is generally bad at this, except in NYC, but I didn't realize just how inadequate our transportation is in comparison. I was surprised even small cities in the Netherlands have public transportation and dedicated walking and biking paths. In the US, most cities/towns aren't walkable - though you can find nature, you have to often drive to a park or something to really walk.

Overall, culture seemed so much more relaxed and less disconnected because of the way housing and transportation was set up. Granted, I was only there for a week, so I can't say much about what the people or life is like, but I visited because a family member went for a business trip and they felt the work life there was less toxic.

I've heard Europe is less friendly than the US, but as a minority, I don't feel people are all too friendly, some are extremely ignorant. I've found it harder to make and keep friends as I get older, either because people are way too busy with work and/or making friends is contingent on things like appearances and popularity. It feels very hard to find friends who are interested in learning about things for the sake of learning and not money or status.",4,1582,371
"Okay. So I wanted to talk about cultural differences and the concept of time because I think it\'s very interesting. And I think it\'s something that people overlook, at least in a diverse place like the United States where we have people from different cultures and different backgrounds. I think sometimes our miscommunications tend to be because of our cultural differences and awareness and difference in experiences. Anyways, I think a lot of it\'s misunderstandings. But I think one of my, sorry, let me just. Okay. So I think one of my most recent experiences was when I went to Japan for a couple of days because I traveled a lot this year, thankfully. And one of the spontaneous trips was to Japan, and it was me and my friend and her sister, the same friend Re. So Me, Ari, and her sister were together. And we\'re all Mexican Americans. Our families are from Mexico. So our concept of time is more laid back, more like, oh, yeah, it\'s okay if we show up 15-20 minutes late, maybe a little bit later. So we\'re more flexible with time and meetings. All of the Americans are a little bit more punctual, so it\'s always a duality we had to deal with, but in this case, we took a more laid back approach. And we were traveling with her friend who\'s Korean. So she\'s Korean and about our age. And she described Korean time as being like, only ten minutes late, max. She was like, you can be five minutes away, you could be ten minutes away, but max. Okay. She was like, you have to be punctual and not more than ten minutes late. And this morning, it was the morning that we were going to DisneySea because she wanted to go to Disney. C. It was her dream to go to DisneySea. We had planned to meet the Korean friend, eugene. So her Korean friend brought her friend who\'s Japanese. Okay. And it was our first time going to meet him. And it was going to be very exciting because it\'s like, wow, we\'re in Japan with someone who\'s Japanese. And then eugene speaks Japanese. So that would help with the language barrier. So in the morning, we\'re getting ready. We stayed up late because we\'re fools and then we woke up and it was a rush to get ready because everyone gets ready at different speeds. Like, I take about an hour, one of my friends takes a long time, oh my gosh, it takes so long. The Korean friend takes so long. And then the other friend, the sister, is quick. So we all have different speeds of getting ready. And then on top of that, we didn\'t realize the different concepts of time. Like, whenever eugene would say, we have to leave at 7:10 because it would be an hour commute, she said, we have to leave at seven. And in my head, I was like, why do I think that\'s enough? It\'s going to be fine; trains come so quickly here. It\'s going to be fine to catch the next one. But then I went to go grab food or even before I went to grab breakfast from the 7-Eleven, I realized, I was like, Wait, guys, we have to hurry. We\'re meeting a Japanese person. They\'re on time if not early. And then that\'s when we all started freaking out because by all, it\'s like me and the other two Mexican Americans were like, we have to hurry now because it\'s like, we can\'t be disrespectful to this person who we are meeting for the first time. We were laughed because we were like, we\'re running on Mexican time. We have to hurry up. We have to hurry up. So it became like this mad rush to hurry to leave exactly at the time eugene said because eugene was just being very polite and was like, yeah, we should leave at like, seven. We should leave at seven. And then now that we have this understanding of like, oh, her friend\'s going to show up early, we cannot be disrespectful and show up late. So we\'re like, we have to go now. So it was like a mad rush. We were running to the station and then we were panicked the whole time. And at the same time that we were kind of like anxious that we were going to be late, our friend was teaching us Japanese phrases that we would be familiar with. And one of them was, I don\'t know if I\'m pronouncing it right, but it was something along the lines of ""it\'s very nice to meet you for the very first time"". So that was another cultural nuance because we were practicing on that train ride. Like, we had to get it right. It was our first time, and the only time we could ever say it to him. Because you can\'t say that again. We finally did. We missed, like, one train, I think. And then we finally made it to the station and we were actually early. We were actually like, early on the time that we had said, and we were so proud of ourselves. We were like, oh, we did it. But it definitely was one of the most poignant examples of cultural differences and how it could be very different when you\'re traveling with people from different cultures because you have a different understanding of time, and then there\'s also, and it was very interesting because throughout the day I really noticed different understandings of how we approach eating and how we talk about beauty. But that was through conversations and we talked from the lens of Mexico, then America, the United States, and then Japan and Korea. So it was like, I guess a very insightful day for understanding cultural nuance. And so that\'s something I really appreciate and really enjoy doing when I travel. So I\'m really appreciative that I got that experience firsthand. And I think it\'s hilarious that we were like, we\'re running on Mexican time. We have to be punctual, we have to be early. Especially on this vacation that me and my friend Ari have been very laid back with on time. This was the one time that we were like, it matters. And it doesn\'t matter just to us, but to other people in our itinerary.","In June, I went to a family reunion. It was held at the home of my cousin's former husband in New Jersey. Last year, he came and picked up me and my partner at our place in New York and drove us there. This time, although one of the cousins organizing the event said she'd try to arrange transportation, she was unable to do so, so we took the bus. This involved taking the subway to Port Authority in Manhattan, then a bus to New Jersey, then calling my cousin on arrival to have someone pick us up. The whole trip should have taken a couple of hours.

I looked at Google Maps before leaving the house and planned our route. We left the house in ample time to catch the bus suggested by the app. On the way to the bus, I called my cousin to confirm that we were on our way. I found out that the host of the party said we should take a different bus, which was a route run by a different bus company. Naturally, this ran on a different schedule.

When we arrived at the terminal, we found we'd have to wait an hour for our bus. When we finally got on the bus, we were relieved and figured we'd see everyone in about an hour's time. Were we mistaken! We hit one of the worst traffic jams I have ever encountered. The trip took well over two hours. By the time we arrived, some of the guests were already leaving.

The best part of the whole party was that one of my cousins had come all the way from Massachusetts. She had told me about a year ago that she loves coconut flan. So, I made it and did not tell her. She was so surprised and pleased that she cried. Her husband, who is Cuban, pronounced it ""Tremendo!"" I felt the long trip had been worth the effort.",4,1270,373
"I want to talk about the Great Floods of 2021. Yes. Okay. So basically, I live in Phoenix, and Phoenix is a desert, and we don\'t get a lot of rain for most of the year, except... Well, it\'s even worse than that with climate change. But previously, we would get these heavy monsoon seasons. So, July and August, it would rain really heavily. And because our soil isn\'t like other soils that soak up water really well, a lot of it\'s like hard, compact, and the water just tends to stay. So we have these things called flash floods. And they happen spontaneously when it rains a lot and it happens in different places. And so, several times in my life, there\'s been times where it would rain so, so hard that certain places would just be flooded. And one time it rained so hard when I was like in high school that our school day was canceled. And it\'s kind of funny to think, like, in a desert, it rains so hard in a desert, you get school canceled. But it\'s actually like a big thing. And so in 2021, we had just moved into this new house, or a new house to us. So it was my first time ever moving home in my life. So I was unfamiliar with kind of like what to expect in a new place. And it rained. Okay. So it was okay. So we moved in July, which is like the worst time to ever move in Phoenix because it\'s so hot. It\'s like 115 degrees, a lot of the year, a lot of the month. So, then moving when you\'re in and out, in and out is horrible. It sucks. And so we had just gone through that month of exhaustion of moving things, and then it being hot because we\'re trying to get used to the AC system. And then, suddenly, it started to rain really hard. It started to rain. Maybe, I think it was like the end of July. It was definitely still the summer. And it rained so, so hard that our backyard became a pond or like a mini Lake. And my dad had, because we were still moving, my dad had a bunch of stuff in the back, and the rain basically it was drowning in the water. And I thought I could save it. I was like, ""Don\'t worry, dad. I\'ll get your stuff."" My dad didn\'t care. I think he had just given up on the stuff from the exhaustion of moving. But I went outside with my rain jacket and then my shorts and my water shoes. And I was, like, pulling stuff. And then my sister joined me. But then my older sister yelled at both of us. And she was like, ""Get out of the water! You\'re going to get electrocuted!"" But it was funny. So, we took photos. The reason she said I was going to get electrocuted was because our home is like the corner of our house is the electrical unit of our neighborhood, so it\'s, like, not a street light, but it\'s the giant light poles, whatever, that run current. And we never had that in our yard before. In our old house, it was, like, in the alley. So the space between homes. But here, this is our first home where we had, like, wall to wall space with the house. So we had that power line in our backyard, and she was like, ""Get out, you\'ll get electrocuted!"" But I think it was funny because we had opened the doors and the windows, and you could just see our front yard was, like, a little mini river of all the water going downstream. And I also wanted to hang out in the water, and I forgot what I did. I think I made, like, a boat or something. I made something to try to float. But at some point, our backyard filled up so much that even our dogs, like our dogs, were looking at the ocean. And I have photos of our dogs sitting, gazing out into what was our lawn. And how is the ocean for them? And it was just so cute because my little dog was still alive back then. And she was just looking out into the abyss of water. And then I think it also became funny because, okay, in retrospect, it\'s funny, but when you\'re kind of going through it, you\'re kind of stressed. But the flooding, the water was rising really, really high up because we learned this later. So it turns out that our house was on an incline. And the fence we had was a wooden fence. So all the water that our neighbors had was swept down to us. And when we looked over to our neighbor\'s homes, it was dry. But we had all the water. So we collected all the water. So, later on, we, like a year or two later, we fixed this by having a brick wall to prevent that from happening. But because it was just, like, all following through, that\'s where all the water came, and it started to get into the house. And we started panicking and screaming, like, ""It\'s getting inside! It\'s getting inside!"" And we had never dealt with flooding before. So then I ran to grab all the towels we had. I started shoving it along the side, and then the pets didn\'t know what to do either. They were kind of useless. And it was also raining diagonally. So then, that\'s why the water was going into our living space. But finally, we were able to mop. Okay. But we were, like, rinsing the rags out and taking a lot of the water out, and it worked out. And the rain stopped. And Arizona\'s rain tends to gaslight you. Like, it would rain really hard. And then ten minutes after, it stops raining, it\'s like the water is gone. Nothing ever happened. All your fears of water and drowning were nonexistent at that point because the sun dried everything up. So that\'s kind of what happened. As soon as it stopped raining, the sun came out, and it kind of dried up all the rain. Rainy Spider song but just in a way quicker manner. And then, it\'s always funny to look back at all the photos because it\'s like, ""Wow, we really were out there in the water trying to save things that my dad didn\'t even care about."" And people, every time there\'s a flooding like that, people post random Snapchat, random social media posts of how people spent their time in the water. This water is gross, but people are still out there playing like I was. And so, I saw videos of people floating down the street in, like, an air mattress or tube. So people make the best out of the rain, although it\'s arguably dangerous because of the electrical current, like wiring. And then, if you\'re floating down a river in an air mattress, who\'s to say you\'re not going to run into a car that\'s, like, trying to also go through the water? The Floods of 2021 were a crazy time. And we learned from it to be more prepared for next time. And I think, and it hasn\'t rained that hard since. And having the brick wall helped a lot. So now the water doesn\'t go in as much.","Well, I would have to say the most recent event that has made a huge impact on my life is TS Imelda. We didn't expect this storm to be what it was, so we were not prepared. The rain fell for the whole day, and we slowly watched the water rising. When it got to about ankle high, we went ahead and moved the vehicles to higher ground (we learned our lesson from Harvey). We went back to the house and started lifting everything ground level up.

After about 4 hours, water started coming into the house. We grabbed some bags and our dog in the husband's truck and went down the road to a friend's house. The next day, we went back down to see the damage that was done. It wasn't anywhere what Harvey was (we got 3 feet of water), but just enough to soak all the carpets and floors, probably an inch of water.

So, we called our insurance companies immediately. They were out the next day. That didn't turn out like I thought it would. It has been a tedious process. First off, they want pictures from before Harvey and after Harvey to prove the work we had done after the last storm, plus all the receipts. Then they want pictures of the house now and as the work is being done this time.

Then we are stuck staying with friends who we love, but two families cannot live together for very long without tempers flaring. It's been about a month, and they're finally done with the house repairs. So, we're hoping to be back in our house by this week.",3,1509,321
"Okay. So, I guess it's not so much of a story kind of, but I wanted to talk through some kind of feelings I've been feeling about the job hunt. I think it feels a little bit more magnified because today at work, the work at my bakery, I felt micromanaged. Yeah, I felt micromanaged by one of the workers. It's just a weird schedule. I'm supposed to be on my own, it's just two workers out of the four cake decorators. And because I'm new, the other one, I guess felt more inclined to try to help me, but I felt annoyed. I felt very micromanaged. And I guess it was just hard because she wanted me to speed up and go faster, but I don't want to, which I know it's like a bakery, fast-paced environment, but I'm like, I'm getting paid minimum wage. It can't be that serious. I don't get a bonus if I sell more. What's the incentive to really speed up, to not get fired? That doesn't seem like enough incentive for me to really try beyond the bare minimum. Yeah, especially like I don't have enough hours. So whatever. So I guess that experience today once again reminded me, like, I need to find another job. I mean, the worker didn't mean anything bad. Like, I really like her. I just think she was a little bit too on top of it. I guess it made me think more about the job hunt and how I've been very slow to apply to other jobs, where I can basically hire paying jobs that require a degree, white-collar jobs, whatever. So, yeah. It made me think about why it's going to take a while. And part of it has been like adjusting to change. Well, first it was, I don't know. I guess maybe I'm running out of excuses, and I think there's more to it than what I thought originally was making me stop. Because first it was like, oh, I had to get quick money, not quick money, but I had to have some source of income. I'm not going to be unemployed for much longer because I spent a lot of my money on travel. So first it was, get a quick job. Then it was like, learn this quick job so I can be comfortable and start applying on the side. And then I feel comfortable in it. But now, and then it was like, adjust to your little sister going to college. But then now I'm like, okay, what's the excuse for being very slow? And part of it was like me just trying to enjoy my time in Phoenix. Like my friends and family, just because I've always had a hard time or a hard relationship with the city or just like my place of birth. I don't know. I always had weird feelings about this city, and I never really felt like I belonged. Now it's like, oh, I'm actually building that sense of belonging, even though I've been here, like, a whole year later, because I worked remotely. I guess one reason why it's taking me so long in the job hunt is because I was trying to build community, and I was spending all my money going out. So kind of hard to find a balance. All my waiting time is going to going out and building community. And then the other part is I guess as I've been looking at browsing at jobs and besides the limitations of not having a driver's license, I'm trying to get creative with how I can swing it, probably just more remote roles. So it's just like a combination of things that discourage me, so not having a driver's license really does impact availability jobs in Phoenix or where I can get around if I don't always have a secure ride and I don't always want to be paying Ubers and lifts. And then another part is like, I guess this is a part. I guess I've been realizing more that the job hunt started to get like a little bit emotional. But the job hunt makes me frustrated of thinking about my last job because I was with the company for three years. And then I turned full time in October. And I mentioned my salary previously. It was wrong. So I was making more than that. But it was like my first big paying paycheck out of college. I don't know. So I just feel like doing the job search makes me feel frustrated because I really feel cheated. I really feel like my last company really sucked. And I don't know how to grapple with those feelings because they do good work. And I always knew I wasn't going to stay long at that company. I just feel like I got such a short end of the stick, and it really sucks because I feel like I'm just a recent college grad, and I feel like I don't know. So the company really pushes on Hispanic, Latino people, like breaking through barriers, going to higher up positions in their company, so it's very marketed with Hispanic, Latino identity and roles outside of service and outside of like I guess I don't know. It's very professional, like white-collar outlook for Latinos and Hispanic people. So I guess. I just feel cheated because the mission is really valuable for what we were working with in our companies, and it was key on mentorship and networking. So it's like I learned so much from that job and. I guess I wish I could have left when I was still on good terms with everyone. I think for the most part I am, but I think my view of them is all tainted. Like one of the coworkers. I think her specifically, she's really gotten under my skin. I think the job relates to me still having mixed feelings about my last job because it's just so crazy. I keep reading all these job descriptions and thinking like, wow, my company didn't have any benefits. We had a birthday bonus or like a week between New Year's and Christmas off, but we didn't have health care. We didn't really have. We had unlimited PTO, but that kind of was a scam. And I always got criticism for taking time off and then I guess I'm just worried like, what if my next job. I don't suss up the red flags. I don't suss them out beforehand and I just walk into another mess. I'm really worried about that. But then I know I'll just quit. I'll just keep applying for jobs until I can trust it. But this job is so agonizing. I didn't realize how much emotion is behind it. And I guess that's what I'm working through. It's just like seeing all these job descriptions making me realize like, wow, my last company was like, they didn't really have any benefits. And then I felt so judged. And I felt like, especially towards the end, they really just gave me a bunch. They gave me things to do and didn't really train me on it. And they had all these, specifically, my boss. I think this is targeted towards my boss and my coworker who's my arch-nemesis now because I feel like both of them put all this pressure on me and didn't really adequately train me. And also, the coworker kind of low-key sabotaged me or tries to sabotage me, and she was really good at it. She was really good at trying to sabotage me. So I guess I'm just worried about all the mind games I have to play at the next role. And just really feeling like, wow, I could have gotten a whole year of experience with them, or I could have had more marketable skills if I had stayed there longer if I was able to stay longer. But I really felt, I guess bullied in a way and really left out and really. Yeah. I feel like my boss kept saying things that made me feel like I wasn't doing a good enough job. But then when I spoke to other people I worked with, they were like other people who aren't directly in the company. They made it so that. They made it sound like I was doing a great job, and I was going above and beyond. So I'm just kind of so disappointed that. The people that I got close to or at least my core team, I feel like towards the end, I just felt so mistreated by them and not this job. And then one of the reasons I guess I have a hard time filling out applications is because I just get wrapped up in the emotion behind it. I don't know. Reading job descriptions, I'm like, damn, I was cheated. I didn't even get a job offer letter. Who the fuck doesn't give their employee a job offer letter? I had to advocate for that, and I had to write my own job description, like I had to do so much for myself. And I'm like, but they're not even skilled, and I don't feel adequate enough to really market myself for these applications. I mean, I'll probably just be like, yeah, I did it. And exaggerate my skills, but I really feel like they failed me. And I haven't gotten over it. I'm kind of frustrated that I haven't gotten over it because it's been months. And you would think traveling around Europe would cure your problem. You would think having the privilege of travel to escape your problems would actually help you address stuff","So, I lost my job. It was so unexpected. I had been working for him for 2 and a half years. When the boss returned from his last trip, we learned the sale was never made. In fact, there weren't any sales all year. The boss continued acting normal. Until one day, he called me and told me he had to let me go. He said, ""You can either quit which will look better on your resume, or I will fire you. You choose, sign these papers.""

It all happened so fast. I grabbed my stuff and walked out. I was relieved because I couldn't stand him, but I was shocked that I wasn't even given a heads up!

It was so shocking because this boss prided himself on making a connection in his establishment. He always boasted about how much better his company was because he wasn't a corporation. Often times, tasks involved his personal life, such as taking his mom to the grocery store or going into his house when no one was home to retrieve something for him. A few times, I had to go let his dog out.

Still, I was let go, told to leave, and I haven't returned.",5,1918,242
"Okay, so I guess I\'m going to talk about risk and the risk I take in my life. And I\'ve been wondering, what\'s the next step? And I always consider myself not a big risk-taker. I\'ve always considered myself someone who plays it safe all the time, who chooses the safest option and just security, just because I struggled to find that in my childhood and growing up. So I guess I made that, like, I don\'t know.\n\nI always just search for stability. But when I think back on my life and major changes I\'ve made, it\'s all been because I\'ve taken risks. And I guess that\'s a little scary. And I\'m wondering where that leaves me now that I\'m in this weird spot in my life where I\'m in between careers and trying to get my footing back in Phoenix. And learning new skills at the same time. So I guess that\'s what I\'ve been thinking about.\n\nThe first risk I took, if I could trace it back, was moving - transferring schools. I wanted to transfer to a school in my neighborhood that supposedly had better education compared to other schools. So I guess that was the first risk that I took. I made the initiative and encouraged my parents to take it on my behalf. It was when I was around nine or eight. And that was hard because moving schools was hard. I felt dumb at that school. I had a lot of imposter syndrome because I felt like it was much more advanced than what I knew, even though I was technically a very smart kid growing up. But then I adapted and made friends. It\'s funny to think that the friends I have now in Phoenix, that I\'m really close to, all kind of came from that elementary school experience, from fourth to eighth grade. So I think it\'s funny that that was the first risk I considered taking.\n\nAnd then another risk I guess I\'ve taken was changing schools again. I think the risks I\'ve taken have just been changes of environments. So I changed schools again in high school because the first school I went to was a complete culture shock. It was a predominantly white school, upper middle class or upper-class backer, on a different side of Phoenix. So it felt weird trying to adjust to that. And I felt like the coursework was weird, and I didn\'t feel challenged. So then I went to this internationally rigorous school. I decided to move to the internationally rigorous school, and then I had to make friends again. Maybe some things don\'t work out the way you want them to, because I felt like I had no life. Okay, I kind of did. I hung out a lot, like I had a lot of good friends for the time. Friends that got me through college, I mean, fucking school.\n\nAnd then I took another risk when I went to Alaska for a summer. I was offered an opportunity to go to Alaska, and I was like, yeah, fuck it, I want to go because I\'m from Arizona. What the fuck do I know about oceans and mountains of snow? So I went, and that kind of sucked a lot. I liked the nature and the exploration part of it, and I liked learning new skills. But I had a really hard time with the group I was with, the pod I was supposed to be with all the time. They were very negative, very picky eaters, and they were expecting Alaska to be a vacation. I was like, ""Y\'all, what part of shitting in the woods made you think that we were going to be at a five-star hotel?"" I don\'t understand what happened there. It was a really hard time because I couldn\'t escape them. They were my main group, and even when I switched, I was still kind of stuck with all of them. So I guess another risk that didn\'t work out in my favor. But it made me learn more about how to deal with people who have different viewpoints in terms of food or in terms of what we were expecting out of the experience.\n\nAnd then I guess another risk was when I went to university far away from home as the first person in my family to go to college. And I was like, I need to escape, I need a change of environment. And I got it. It wasn\'t paid for fully. I had a lot to make up, but I constantly applied for scholarships to make sure I could afford to go to that school. So ultimately, I got it paid off - almost a full ride. I want to say like, 95% of my schooling was paid. So that was another risk I took.\n\nSo I guess a lot of the risks in my life have been just changing environments. Because there was little to no hope in studying abroad, but at the last minute on the last application date, I decided to go to Greece during the pandemic, like the height of the pandemic, because I really wanted to live abroad. And I was like, it\'s probably now or never. And that also didn\'t work out. It didn\'t work out the way I wanted it to. I wanted it to be more fun and exciting in a fun way. But it was exciting in a stressful way because what was I expecting? The pandemic resources were scarce. Greek people didn\'t even want us there because they were like, ""You\'re using up our resources,"" which is very valid. But I realized that at the time, I was just like, I want to change my environment. If I\'m going to be stuck in my room, I might as well be stuck in my room in Athens.\n\nAnd then another risk was also going to Denmark because I didn\'t know how it was going to work out with my degree. But I was like, I really, really want to go abroad. I want to keep living abroad and experiencing different ways of life and incorporating that into mine. So I went, and that was a lot better. Denmark was actually one of the safest risks I\'ve taken, one of the risks that took that came out the best way possible.\n\nCome on, Elvis. So that was actually one of the better risks that worked out where I got to learn, make new friends. But then it was really hard towards the end because of certain accidents that happened and people that died. But it worked out for the most part.\n\nAnd then I find myself in the latest mini-risk. I\'m still getting over my trauma with my last job, my last full-time job. It took a lot of energy and peace of mind from me, and I knew it was risky going into it. I went still because I was like, what other job offers do I have? And I just wanted money. I was just like, I want to graduate and I want to have money. I don\'t want to work through this whole stressful process. I don\'t want to relocate. I was tired of constantly changing locations. So I guess now, and then, I guess the irony. I\'m kind of like, how do I take a risk without always changing locations? I can\'t just keep moving and not running away from problems but running towards problems in a different location. Hey, don\'t do that.\n\nSo I guess whatever risk means in the context of staying in the same space for a long time. Because now I quit that job without a backup plan. Well, my backup plan was to travel. My plan was to quit this job, travel for a couple of months, come home, apply for a part-time job while I get my footing again. And that\'s exactly what I\'m doing. So I take these risks, but I take them with plans that I have in mind. But now I\'m in that weird spot where I\'m like, well, I\'m doing according to a plan. What do I do now? Or do I want to take another risk? Or do I just want to play it safe? I have this bakery job, but it doesn\'t pay well at all for the dreams I have and the hopes and the degree I have.\n\nYeah, just wondering, what does taking risk mean now that I\'m in one spot? And I see myself in the city for the next couple of years while I build up savings and build up a safety net, so that when I do leave, I can mitigate necessary risks.","We are creating soft multi-layered forms that interact with environments and create a space in cities that open up our imagination, and allow us to think about a different way of being.

So, I had $300, and for graduation, I got a plane ticket to Bali. And I went off on my own and started walking through the rice fields until I found a little house to rent. I went as a painter, I shipped all my paints, and they got lost, and that is how I became a sculptor because I had no paint.

I was in a fishing village. They had fishing twine and began just experimenting. And from there, I had this dream of bringing it back home. I applied to seven art schools, and I was rejected by all seven. And that turned out to be the luckiest thing ever in my life because it forced me to have to learn how to teach myself.

The education to do what I do, there is no program. If I had gone to a program, it might have led me somewhere, but it wouldn't have been as authentic a direction. Any kind of life where you're trying to do something new and creative, you're gonna hit rejections all the time.

My mom had a saying for that too. It's like just toughen up, let it come at me. Just because you're rejecting me from every single art school I've applied to, that doesn't mean you get to say that I'm not an artist.

The thing I had to teach myself after college was how to hear my own voice. Like honestly, I just didn't even know it to recognize it. Making decisions is gonna happen to you your whole life. They are always hard. You've got to figure out how to make them. And you have to listen to yourself and get to know yourself.",5,1650,367
"I don't know if it's really well, I don't really have a story in mind. I think I'm just kind of like, have a lot of anxiety involving the job search or I guess, more shame around it. Because I guess is what I had to talk out. So a coworker of mine from my last job, and there's only, like, three of them, three coworkers, so one of them reached out and was like, hey, how are you doing? Oh, yeah. He wished me happy birthday. I was like. That was a while ago, but anyways, so I guess he reached out was like we should catch up. And I guess since I got that message, it kind of just been ashamed or embarrassed about my job search. Because I left that job in April. I was just done. Now that I think back about it, I feel like it couldn't be handled the resignation better instead of just setting a resignation letter to my boss. Well, I think I did pretty good given the circumstances and how I was in the moment. So I guess I'm just, like, embarrassed that I left the job in April. And now it's October, and I'm working at a bakery in a grocery store. So I think I carry a lot of shame around my lack of professional occupation. Especially because a lot of people. Have I guess I've internalized the idea that I'm meant for something great. I think a lot of people in my life, well, I know for sure a lot of people in my life have always told me that. I'm destined for something great, that I'm meant to do something good in the world. I've been hearing this since I was young. And I guess it's like, and even my last job. Like my boss would have to say, like I'm meant to do such greater things. So I guess it's like I'm feeling the weird pressure of. Being constantly told my whole life that I'm going to achieve greatness and then having this low period in my life right now, where I'm like, okay, well, I was able to travel a lot and I met really cool people, had really cool experiences. But then now coming back to reality, working a minimum wage job or minimum wage? Isn't livable. They're cutting my hours. The cost of living is crazy. Everything's increasing in prices, my family can't really make more money. We're barely getting by. So I guess his comment, just this comment. He generally probably just wants to catch up. And he's been very supportive of my growth. And I guess I'm just embarrassed to think, like, wow, I quit this job months ago, and yet I'm stuck in a minimum wage job, working more hours for less money than when I worked over there. So yeah. I don't know what to make of it right now. So yeah. So I guess I'm just dealing with those feelings of, like, embarrassment. Especially knowing that I graduated. With such a prestigious University, and that's kind of shoved down my throat. I just remember being in Korea and meeting my friend's Korean friend's family. And them just at least especially the Korean friend talking up my school. And they're like, she went to such a really good school. And I was like, oh, my God. I'm like I graduated. Well, but at what cost. And I don't know. I feel like I have all these expectations of my future being great. And right now I don't feel like I'm professionally living up to it, but I am doing better in terms of sense of community and enjoying hobbies and free time. So I'm growing in other ways and reconnecting and things that I missed through the pandemic and through whatever shitshow was last year. But I feel kind of like, wow. Here I am, three months into a job I gave myself the five-month deadline. I was like, when I come back, it's going to take five to eight months to find a full-time job and I just have to have a job in the meantime. I don't know. I just feel me. So yeah, I ashamed, embarrassed, and just kind of, like, disappointed the reality of life and how expensive everything was. And I wish I was born rich, and I wish I was a neffle baby. Instead, I have to forge all these connections on my own because. I don't have family ties to extreme wealth. But whatever, I guess.","I got a D instead of an F in a government class. If I had gotten an F, I wouldn't have graduated. I didn't like school, so it was a particularly unrewarding experience for me. I've never been influenced that much by other people's comments or goals. 

I work hard to make up my own mind with as much information as I can get. In fact, if I let everybody else influence what we were doing, the human genome wouldn't be sequenced now. 

I'd say, first decide what you want to accomplish in life. What do you want to contribute to society? Where do you want to do that, and then follow that path.",3,924,135
"Or, wait, is he too loud? Okay, so, my story... I guess I just wanted to talk briefly about my driving experience. So, I previously have driven throughout the years, just not well. I've always had a challenge driving. I think it was mostly the lack of desire to drive. So, I've always had smaller experiences here and there, but I never went on the main road. So, I finally decided I just need to pay for driving school. I figure, if I put money into it, that's going to force me to have to do it and get my license because as I'm doing my job search, a lot of jobs I'm looking at are requiring an Arizona driver's license. So, I figured I just need it. I don't have to use it necessarily. So, the courses I paid for are four courses and let me see if I can recall the courses I paid for. My last lesson, I basically get tested and if I get 80% or higher, I get my license which I actually feel confident about because today I was driving on the main roads and I was maintaining a conversation with the driving instructor. So, I feel like that was already multitasking. And just from the preliminary grade that she gave me, I got a 60%. I didn't even know she was grading me. So, I feel like if, on my first lesson, I got a 60%, I should be able to do well next time. So, I'm on track to get my license and next time I get to do the freeway. So, yeah, I'm reaching my goals little by little.","When I graduated from high school, I had some bumps in the road. I got into the University of Washington, and I had some financial difficulties there and then ended up going back to community college.

Then I applied to the University of Washington chemical engineering program, and I was accepted. I did have some interesting reactions in my family about chemical engineering. They thought that was only for guys, and that was in 2006.

And I'm like, well, that's not true. There is definitely a ton of moments like that. The moment where you doubt yourself. And you're like, you know what, I'm not about that comment. And you're like, how dare you make me doubt myself for a second.

I'm not going to let this get me down. I'm just gonna keep on going. I'm gonna see this through. You'd be really surprised how well you can perform when you push yourself.",5,335,188
"Okay. So it\'s not really a happy story to tell right now, but I guess I\'ve just been feeling a little overwhelmed. With the current situation, Israel and Palestine in terms of the current war that Israel is waging on Palestine. Yeah, I guess I just wanted to talk about the overall lack of sense of power that I have, which is... I don\'t know. I just feel like I have such little power to do any change and it kind of really just sucks. I feel like the situation just overall really sucks because when I came to the war in Ukraine and Russia, everyone was on the side of Ukraine. They\'re like, ""Okay, defend your land. Protect yourself. Your heritage."" Vladimir Putin is like the obvious... like the villain. It was very like media always can support of Ukraine, so many countries with Puerto, Ukraine and their sovereignty. And then when it comes to Israel and Palestine, I feel like a sense of loss. I don\'t know, like a mind warp. Because media is sharing one side of the story. So like news, popular news outlets are showing how vulnerable Israel is and how they\'re the victim. But then what you\'ll see on the ground, like a lot of social media, I follow in Palestine and have been following for years. I didn\'t really note too much about Palestine and Israel, but I knew a little bit because I was already following creators that talked about the Palestinian cause. And I guess I\'m just... like baffled at how the media paints one picture of Israel, and then the underground roots of people who are talking and organizing show a completely different side of the story. They definitely show like Palestinians are the vulnerable population. They\'re the ones who like hospitals are being bombed with civilians are being hurt. I guess I\'m just trying to grapple with the mind fuck of it all of Western media showing Israel as like they\'re the ones defending themselves as retaliation. But... it\'s an overkill like in the literal sense. Israel has just been bombing Gaza. Nonstop. And the people there have no refuge from it. And the fact that Israel is actually committing war crimes, like bombing hospitals, bombing safe zones, cutting off power supplies. I guess the final final straw for me where I\'m like, ""Oh my God, I guess..."" The final point of despair. Like I was already slowly sinking into the form of despair. Of, like, ""Wow. Israel is bombing hospitals like they\'re not letting humanitarian aid in."" It was like all these... big things Israel was doing that were like little stabs in my heart, I don\'t know, or like in my sanity I don\'t know. I already felt the pain little by little, and I\'m very detached from it like I don\'t have much emotional connection to the region or to its unique problems. But... the more and more I kept hearing about things happening with Israel, the more I was like, ""Oh my God, this is bad."" But I think the final final straw, where I\'m literally like, ""Yeah, I need to be calling representatives. I need to be emailing and sending letters."" The final drive for me was that Israel completely bombed and decimated service to the area. So now, like Palestinians and people in Gaza, or at least people in Gaza literally cannot call anyone like they can\'t call. They can\'t text. They have no access to Internet. Like all the news outlets reporting from there have no cell service. I don\'t know how it happened. And I think that\'s the final straw for me where I\'m like, ""You literally cut off the last source of communication we have to people on the ground, people who are worrying about their families, people who are worrying about their friends. And these are war crimes. And I just feel like baffled, like we\'re not doing anything about it. The international community is completely failing people in Gaza. It is such a stark contrast from what was happening in Ukraine, how people were sending money in Ukraine, people were like, ""I\'ll host you. I\'ll give you refuge in my home."" And it\'s like, the complete opposite. And I really don\'t understand how or why. I\'m just baffled. I\'m also like, yeah, I think people see this as like a righteous religious war to some extent, like some people, I think. I don\'t know, that\'s like my very limited take on it. That people see as like, ""Oh, Israel, Christianity versus Muslims."" And then I don\'t know. I feel like that\'s to some extent, some of the comments I\'ve seen, but I\'m just like, how are we okay with this super powerful country or, now in the comparison like super powerful country completely obliterating another one. How are we as a society okay when someone who holds so much power is okay to take it out on someone who holds so little, like a big guy beating up a little kid. Like how? I\'m just, like, amazed. I don\'t know, amazed. Just baffled that we\'re okay with this. And there\'s really nothing I can do because like the US backs Israel. So I feel like I have no power. I\'m one person, one person who doesn\'t have money. I don\'t have power. I don\'t have money. I don\'t have influence. First Gen in this country. I have almost nothing to my name. What power do I really have to help in this fight? I\'m at a loss. And the most I can do is share posts on social media, and even then, that makes me a little anxious about... the amount of common people have. But I just repost a couple of things here and there. But I\'m like, what good is it? Or like, I try to talk to my parents or to people around me. Let them know, like, this is the other side. Yeah, the media. Western media... is painting it this way. But these are like actual videos and testimonies I\'ve seen from people on the ground. I just feel so helpless, helpless, and hopeless. And it\'s such a complete, stark contrast from Ukraine and Russia. Like so huge. I don\'t even know what to do with this information. And I guess like a part of it, because I feel like I think when it comes to me, whenever I worry about something bigger than myself, it\'s usually... Like a sign of some insecurity. No. Okay. I get you. Like, okay. I realized that whenever I\'m nervous or scared about something way bigger than myself, it\'s usually a reflection of a vulnerability or insecurity I have of myself. In relation to myself. And I think I just come to realize that the US doesn\'t care about its citizens. It doesn\'t care about... I hate think about money and I already knew that. But this is another example where I\'m like, wow, I am a citizen of this country. I\'m paying taxes to this country. I want the best for the people in the country. But the reality is the government, the establishment, people who have power and money don\'t care about me. They don\'t care about people who don\'t have power, who don\'t have influence. They don\'t have money. They don\'t care about... its citizens. It just cares about the bottom line and the profit. I keep thinking about the hostages in Gaza who can\'t leave. I guess Israel too. I don\'t know about that. I don\'t know what the fuck Israel is doing, but I just keep thinking about American citizens and residents stuck in Gaza, and like me growing up and being told that American passport, so powerful, so privileged, like the US people don\'t mess with Americans abroad or anything. Because yeah, because it\'s like the US will get involved. And I\'m like, this is such bullshit. Like I was just fed lies. Growing up. The US isn\'t too shit for its citizens when it comes down to money. Or like when it comes down to money and prestige versus the safety of a people, the institutions don\'t give a fuck. So... Yeah. So I guess I\'m just like, these are all the feelings I\'m grappling with. I have so little power in comparison to this giant ass award as being waged. People don\'t give a shit about minorities. I don\'t know, like non-white minorities. Non-White citizens. People, residents. And that the State truly does not care for your well-being. At least the US doesn\'t. So I guess it just makes me hopeless. So yeah, that\'s what I\'ve been grappling with the last couple of days, weeks. And I don\'t know what to do with this.","I worked in an office, and every place that I worked at, I ended up computerizing. I ended up starting a company in manufacturing. But I always knew that I was meant to do something to help other people. 

And I was in Niger. And there was a little girl that came up to me with flies on her face. And I just felt that that's intolerable. That could have been my granddaughter. How could I not do something? 

I think that I have the opportunity to live what I think should be the American Dream when what I think should be the American Dream is that we use these resources, we use these talents to help those that didn't get that.",4,1752,136
"Okay. So, the story is how I got really interested in the intersection of science and computer graphics. I had been interested in both of these topics for a long time. I wasn't really sure how they went together for a professional career. But I was in grad school, and I was taking a class on biochemistry and plant metabolism. And we had a chance to write a paper. And the paper was supposed to be about a process, a biochemical process that takes place in plants. And I asked the professor if instead of a paper, I could do an animation on a process. I thought it might be more engaging, more interesting, maybe a way to bring that process to life. And he agreed to it. So, I set out to find a process. I found something nice. I worked on it. I used a variety of computer graphics tools and ended up with an animation that I thought explained the process really well. And then I turned that in as my project instead of a paper, and I had a chance to present that to students. And the students really enjoyed it. They learned a lot from the process, being able to watch it happen as a cycle. And I thought it was a really good example of how science and graphics can come together for an educational purpose.","We took a really cool course that invited people who weren't engineers but who wanted to do some sort of science change. It was an art science class that said, ""It's all about combining the beauty of art and the analytical power of science to do something."" So you just had to come in and have an idea and then find a way to combine those two to come up with a solution. So, we just locked ourselves up and brainstormed. And this is what we presented. And thankfully, being at somewhere like Harvard, there were a lot of resources that were made available to us. So, from the class we got a small grant to keep on playing around with the idea.

And for a while, it was just kind of trying to understand what this ball is. Engineers didn't believe it could work. So we actually had to research how it would work. Research the Faraday Principle, then build their own conceptual model, test it in South Africa, and then have engineers say, ""Okay.""

For us, it was really interesting because people always say, ""How do you think out of the box?"" And I'm like, ""It's really easy to think out of the box when you don't even know the parameters of the box. If you don't even know that a box exists."" Whereas knowledge is power, sometimes with knowledge, it's very easy to see the obstacles. And we were just like, ""Why wouldn't it work?""

Even though we did not necessarily have the technical expertise, we certainly knew the context.",4,260,316
"Okay. So the story is from when I was a little kid, and my dad would take me fishing, so we would go in a boat out on the lake to catch fish. And because I was a little kid, I didn\'t like to wake up early, not that I do now, but I didn\'t want to wake up really early in the morning and leave before the sun came up. And I got tired of sitting out in the hot sun and not catching anything, not having any fun. And so I would complain a lot, and that\'s hard for an adult to listen to, a little kid complain a lot. And I said, ""I was bored,"" and I wasn\'t catching anything, and I kind of gave up. And my dad told me that you won\'t catch anything unless you have your bait in the water, which is true. So he was trying to say, like, you\'ll have more fun if you keep working hard. But as a kid, it didn\'t really resonate with me, but many years later, as an adult, that saying has stuck with me. And I\'ve taken it as more of a metaphor. And the idea is that if you don\'t try, you can\'t really succeed. So you have to try. So I think it\'s a nice memory. At the time, I didn\'t really like to listen to what he had to say because I was bored and I wanted to go home and play and watch cartoons and stuff. But it\'s an important memory and it reminds me that in order to have success, you have to keep trying.","I grew up in Honduras. I was always dreaming; my mind was always dreaming. I knew that I didn't wanna be a doctor, that I didn't wanna be a lawyer. 

When I was eight years old, I was making caramels to sell in school, and today I'm making the same thing. 

So when you see yourself, what you did when you were little—what you really enjoyed doing—just go back to that age. 

The point is really enjoying what you do. And it's not so much about money—of course money counts—but when you enjoy what you like to do, you work so hard that eventually the money is gonna come because hard work is paid.",4,318,134
"Okay. So this story is about a time that I was recruiting someone to do an educational video with me. I wanted to create videos about math and science that could be used for teacher professional development. And I was looking for participants. And when I was out one night, I went to like an art show. And I found a guy selling handcrafted metal goods, like belt buckles and stuff. And I asked him if he might be willing to talk about the math and science of that process. And he said he's actually a motorcycle mechanic. And I said, wow, that's interesting. Maybe we can do a video about that. Maybe about the math of motorcycles somehow. And he said, I don't really do math. And I thought that was maybe unusual because I assumed he did somehow. And I said, well, what do you like to do with motorcycles? And he told me that he liked to make them go fast. And I said, well, how do you do that? And he said, well, one way that I do that is by adjusting the power curve or the torque of the engine. And I thought to myself, well, that's physics and that's math. And then he said he likes to maybe increase the volume of the cylinders inside the engine. And I thought, well, that's geometry. And then he talked to me about how different grades of fuel, like different octane of gasoline, has an effect on the performance of the engine. And I said, well, that's chemistry and math as well. So I thought to myself this whole time that he does use math, but he just doesn't think about it in that way. So I was able to convince him to do a movie. And we did one. And he ended up talking about some of these ideas on camera and then we were able to link that discussion to math education standards and then present that to teachers. And so it ended up being a successful video. And one of my important memories of that project.","I'm a hands-on guy. I could never be a good boss because I can't sit at a desk and manage. I'd hire someone to manage, and I'd rather work on the cars because that's what I like to do. I like to work with my hands. Ever since I was five, I was working with my hands with my father. He's a cabinet maker.

I did every job under the sun when I was in high school. I worked at restaurants, I was a bartender, I volunteered as a mechanic cleaning parts when they were changing engines. Time went by, I helped them with this, with that.

Next thing you know, I got a job at an auto repair shop. They said, ""Why don't you take that engine out?"" And I'm like, ""I don't know how."" He's like, ""Just start unbolting it, and we'll take care of it, we'll help you along.""

And the next thing you know, 20 years later, I have my own.",2,408,211
"So, this is relatively short, but in about maybe a year ago, as a family, we finally took my mom on a wish list vacation to the Grand Canyon. My brother and sister and I decided that it was a good time, and there was something that she had really been wanting to do for a long time. And we're all growing up now, so it's hard to get everybody together. But I did a lot of planning and got it worked out. Everyone got flights, and we all met up and flew out there and did it. We got a car, rented that, drove around, saw some really interesting sights along the way. Finally made it to the Grand Canyon, did a little bit of light hiking, and it was a really great trip for the family.","My wife and I went on a small, last-minute vacation to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. It was in April of this year. It was a very memorable trip for me. I love spending time with my wife, and when we can get away at the last minute, that just makes it that much more special.

Gatlinburg is where we spent our honeymoon, and it has special significance to us. This time was special because we just bonded so much more than we usually do. We got to do more things because the weather was warmer this time around. We got to stay close to downtown, so we took a lot of walks together to a lot of different places.

The most memorable part was sitting on a balcony at a restaurant overlooking the main road that goes through town. We spent hours there just talking and people-watching. I still think about that afternoon and how much fun we had together just being together and not really doing anything at all.

Besides that day, we had a couple of great meals at some neat places. We also went to try a new place out that was really bad and yet we still made the most of it.

Overall, that trip was one of my most favorite times of my life. It was because I spent it with my favorite person I've ever met. We still talk about how we can't wait to go back, but I don't think any trip will compare to that one.",4,159,280
"Okay. So this trip is from the United States to Brazil. The story is, I was working in a science lab and had a lot of opportunities to work with international colleagues. Generally, they were from India, China, South America, and specifically, Brazil. What really happened was, I just was working with these colleagues and we became friends. And at one point, some friends of mine offered me an opportunity to travel back home with them over a winter break. So, I talked with them about it and I talked to some other friends that were also going to Brazil, to a different city. And, I had gotten it all worked out and I flew down there and met up with one group, one family. And then hung out with them a little bit, went to the beach and that was really great. And then I took an internal flight to another city and met up with my other friends. And then hung out with them for a while and had a good time there as well. And then at the end of the break, I flew back. But overall, it was a wonderful trip, a great experience, trying new foods, meeting new people, and experiencing that different culture. So, yeah, I had a great time.","I enlisted for three years, and two of those years were spent in France. One year in the southwest, and one year in Paris. This is where I really learned to eat.

I'm from a Creole Acadian family, and my mother was a wonderful, wonderful cook. So I grew up with good food, which I think is very important if you eventually want to write about food.

On returning from France, I went to work as a general assignment reporter at the newspaper, so I went to my editor and I said, ""I don't wanna do this anymore, and is there anything else I can do?""

When he said, ""We need a restaurant reviewer,"" I said, ""Why don't we just stop right there?""

And I'm sure of it, there are millions like me, who start a job and find that it's a perfect fit. It's just the greatest feeling you could possibly have.",3,251,189
"So, I have a story about one of my pets that I had as a child. So, I think I was in high school when I got a hamster. And hamsters are really small. And they're fast. But they're little. And the story is about one night. The story is about one night where I had gone to sleep but the lock on the cage door was apparently not completely locked. And my hamster escaped during the night while I was asleep. So, it's important to know, my bedroom was on the opposite end of the house from where my parents were. So, during the night, unknown to me, my hamster found a way out and then somehow got out of the cage. Dropped off of a dresser where he was, so about a meter or so, and then he had crawled through the house somehow and had escaped the attention of our dog and ended up in my parents' bedroom. On my mom, tickling her chin with his nose in the middle of the night. And she woke up and found him and then was very surprised. And she brought him back to my room and locked him in the cage and told me about it the next morning. But, we all thought that was very funny, that he had escaped and then crawled all the way across the entire house to get to my mom and then crawled up on the bed to get to her and then woke her up by tickling her chin. Now they liked each other. They had a good relationship. So, we just thought that was funny.","I have always wanted a pet cat, but it isn't until now that I decided to actually adopt one! I got her from an animal shelter near me and I named her Zig-Zag because she is so fast. She is a tabby, and when she wants you to pet her, she does this adorable thing where she tries to push your hand down with her paws, and it's so cute.

She is very talkative, and she loves to be picked up. A lot of my friends have pet cats, and I can't wait for Zig-Zag to meet them! I play with her every day, and she loves to run and play outside (and chase birds).

She has made my life so much better since I got her. She is amazing, and I am so happy I adopted her!",4,309,159
"Okay. So, this story is another story about a pet, and this one at the time, I was dating this girl. And she had a dog, and we both enjoyed playing with this dog. She was really nice. And one thing that was really memorable for me was when we would take her to a park and let her off the leash. And then we would play hide and go seek with her. So, typically what would happen is one of us would hold the dog on the ground. She was seated, but we would cover her eyes with our hands so she couldn\'t see. And then the other one would run and hide behind the tree somewhere far away. And then when they were well hidden, whoever was holding the dog would let her see and then ask questions like, ""Where is she? Where did she go?"" Something like that just to get the dog excited. And then the dog would look around and not know where the person was, and then she would get excited and she would go into a hunting mode. And then she would start sniffing around on the ground and looking around and trying to check everything. And then when she finally found the other person, she would get really excited. And then the other person would laugh and get her all worked up. And then it would be really happy, and then she would run back really excited. And we would do it again, just changing roles. But it was a really fun moment and it was an enjoyable memory.","A few months ago, I was at Petco. I saw a woman trying to wrangle a cat inside one of the cat cages while she was cleaning it, so I stopped to offer to help. I held the cat while she was cleaning the cage and he started purring, rubbing his head on my chin, and practically went to sleep in my arms. I got to talking about the cat with the woman, learning a bit of his tumultuous history. There was no way this cat would have all the behavioral problems that the sheet said he did. I chatted for almost an hour, and by the end, I had all but adopted the cat.

I took him home with me that day, borrowing a carrier from the rescue group to transport him. Although the first few weeks were rough, he integrated well with my other cats. The other young cat hid from him for quite some time, spending almost entire days under the couch and staring at me with eyes that said, ""Who is this guy in my space?"" Eventually, she snuck out to sniff him before darting away, and one day, I woke up to find them both on the bed. Opposite corners, to be sure, but together on the bed!

It was a great relief to see everyone be happy. I named him Kismet for the twist of fate that brought him to me. He's been an amazing cat and even a surrogate dad for some kittens I agreed to foster. He's very fond of kittens, letting them crawl all over him and cleaning their ears at every opportunity.

I'm really glad I met Kismet, and I'm even gladder that he'll be a part of my life going forward.",3,300,333
"So this story is about me moving across the country, from Florida to Massachusetts, with my girlfriend. And we had to bring two rabbits. So, I had never done that before. I had moved across the country before, but not with another person and not with two rabbits. Especially, so that was kind of an interesting challenge.\n\nRabbits are not the kind of animal that you need to take outside to go to the bathroom. They can stay in their little cages, but we had to have them in these small cages for car transport. And then the funny thing, the story is that we stayed at a variety of hotels and places like that on the way because we were driving. But not all of them were open to pets.\n\nBut rabbits are not your typical cat or dog because they stay in a cage, and not a lot of people have rabbits. But I remember just the challenges of having to get to the hotel and then moving the rabbits into the space. And I remember staying at this one sort of roadside bed and breakfast-type place, and we had to move the rabbits inside. But once they were in, we were able to let them out and run around. And they played a little bit. And that was fun, but it was just a unique challenge to me to move across country with these two small pets and then facing the challenges of meeting their needs as well as ours as we did this.\n\nAnd one time we tried to sneak them into a hotel because the hotel wasn\'t really clear on their animal policy. And then the hotel staff saw it, and they\'re like, ""no, you can\'t stay here with those rabbits."" And so we had to go find another place. So that was unexpected and kind of disappointing, but it\'s just part of the deal. Moving with rabbits.","I'm the curator of Behavioral Husbandry and Welfare for Oklahoma City Zoo. So, I spend a lot of time looking, observing, learning everything we can about the species and about what their needs are to give them many choices in their environment. So that they have varied days and they have a very dynamic environment that they're living in.

When I was five years old, I had an encounter with a dolphin. And I was able to look that animal in the eye, and that was it for me. I wanted to dedicate my life to working with animals. When I left college, I thought, I'm ready. Put me in a job, I know what to do.

And what I found was the animals were the best teachers. They have taught me humility. I think that's a big one. They've taught me compassion, to be a little bit more open and be very understanding. Especially to other human beings.

That was something I learned when I left college. I had amazing experiences in college, and I loved my classes, but I don't think I really started becoming well-rounded until I got out of the classroom. And I really started learning the real-world stuff.

So talk to people, hear their stories, and keep an open mind because every person has something to teach you.",4,356,259
"Yeah, no, I'm just doing a little bit of research on this particular flea medicine for my dog. It was interesting for me to learn about how these medicines work, especially for fleas, for example. So I learned a lot about how you apply this on the skin and how the oil glands basically absorb it from the skin and then propagate it within the body or neurologically propagate the medicine or this particular oil, per se. And it just spreads across the dog's skin, which technically kills the fleas. It's pretty interesting to know that. I was also pretty surprised, again, I was awkward that how far medicine has come to do all this with the body of a human being or of a dog, for example. So it's pretty interesting to see that.","I've been dealing with a chronic, ""incurable"" medical condition for around 16 years, but recently, I've discovered something that might be a potential cure. They say food is the best medicine, and I found, perhaps serendipitously, a product at Costco that provided great relief from this medical condition, which can now be classified as a parasitic infection according to my recent blood work results. It happened roughly 2 months ago, but I will describe in detail what the product is and why it helps my condition.

Looking at it from a broader perspective, this event was magnificent and a relief, as it offers tremendous hope for the future, and for others that may have similar woes. While browsing for cheeses in the cheese aisle at Costco, there was a particular brand that stood out to me. It said, ""New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese"" on the package label. What is so special about New York extra sharp cheddar cheese, I thought. I've tried so many cheddar cheese brands before, but with little to no benefit.

It turns out that this particular one uses annatto as a food coloring. In general, food coloring is regarded as detrimental to one's health, but annatto is unique. It doubles both as a spice and a food coloring agent. The spice is mild and not usually detectable by our bodies. After eating this cheese, something special happened. The parasites that have been plaguing me for decades started imploding, and there was a mass exodus that I do not wish to describe in detail, but it involved running to the bathroom 30-40 times in the span of 5 hours.

But why? Why did this agent work when so many other expensive medical treatments and anti-parasitic medicines have failed in the past? In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual components of the cheese are important. Annatto is an anti-parasitic agent according to the medical literature. It offers numerous benefits in terms of health and is a relatively common spice used in cooking. Combined with the minuscule amount of milk sugar in the cheese, often referred to as whey, the overall effect is synergistic.",4,155,417
"Yeah, I'm really excited about watching a movie tomorrow. It's about Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb per se. They do things that are pretty interesting in this movie. It's the subject itself. It's very science-driven, and it's all about the atomic bomb and a biography of a pretty well-known legend. But the second part is the filmmaker, Christopher Nolan. He's a pretty interesting and a pretty well-renowned director. And all his movies have been pretty fantastic and amazing. So I'm really excited about watching that movie tomorrow, trying to get some tickets. But finally, I was able to get one for tomorrow with my cousins. And we're trying to leverage a Friday and go and watch this movie, which I'm really excited about.","My brother-in-law and I just really had it in our heads that we wanted to try to make the great American movie. So we did a lot of shooting on film, not knowing really what we were doing. We didn't go to school or anything like that, and it failed miserably.

There's close to about $30,000 worth of film that sits undeveloped. I don't think I'll ever develop it.

I wanted to go into film when I was younger, but I didn't feel like I had what it takes. I didn't feel like I had the guts to do that. Now I feel like I could do it. But fear of failure is definitely always there.

I know I'm going to fail. It's going to happen. The only way that you're going to get good is if you fail.",4,149,164
"But yeah, just the other day, me and my dog, we were playing in our backyard, and I've got a toy for him, which is like a baseball. Sorry, a football. Meant for dogs with squeaks as well. For the first time, we played so much that even I felt exhausted because I was running behind him a lot, and he was also pretty exhausted by the benefits. So I would just go to one corner of my house, throw the ball over my house into the backyard, and he would just go crazy, bonkers running through the whole distance because that's technically the longest path. So I was trying to get him all worked out, and then run like I was trying to make him run as much as he can. But what I discovered is like, it's a nice opportunity for me as well to burn some of my calories as well. So at the end of the day, both him and I, we were pretty exhausted, but we were pretty happy after playing for such a long time and burning so many calories while playing basically.","I went to a jiu-jitsu club night, and the guy teaching was a blue belt. I think I was a purple belt at the time. And, well, I kicked his butt royally. He's like, ""Well, you need to start teaching over here."" So I took that over and just kept rolling with it.

And at first, it was just to stay in shape, keeping all my skills good. And then I kept it up, kept it up, and when I ended up deciding, ""Hey, this is what I wanna do,"" it wasn't like a really quick decision. It took several years for it to culminate into something that was feasible.

We call it MAT therapy. It's very therapeutic because you're in the moment. You're only worried about the moment, 'cause this guy's trying to choke you. He's trying to throw you. MAT therapy and kinetic problem-solving.

I'm in this bad spot, getting comfortable in bad spots. In my mind, I'm going, ""Hey, this is no problem. I got this ginormous dude trying to squish me."" So if I can breathe here, man, you can breathe anywhere.",3,216,238
"Yeah. So basically, yesterday, I finally went ahead and built my own raised garden bed for my backyard. For the first time, it was pretty nice and fulfilling at the end of it. I got some tools from my friends. I had some leftover lumber from the time when our contractors did the front. Air France. So I just sat down, spent two to three hours. It was not sunny. It was cloudy. It's good working conditions, but basically, put together a big garden raised garden bed that I'm very proud of. The wood still needs treatment and before I put in soil, there's some fall-up stuff that I need to do, but it was definitely very fulfilling. And one of those things where you kind of delayed for a long time, but then you're like, let's do it now. So I just did that. And I felt very good about it.","I wanted to make wine, and I found this guy who helped me. He was a great master of wine. So, I went out where the winery is right now, and I was just looking around. There's a flat spot, and I built the whole winery around where someone would stand at the tasting bar and look out the window and see Bridge Creek Wall, which is the highest rock wall in Icicle Canyon.

It took about ten years to build that winery. It took four years to lay the stone on it. Just walk out in the yard here and pick up stone. We did that for four years and laid it up on that building.

I was poor. When you're poor, you do stuff yourself. And now you know I'm making 100 barrels a year and living on 25 acres of property out in the middle of nowhere. We're four miles off the power grid.

You need to make the first step. It's like going for a run; you gotta get your shoes on. You gonna get out and there start doing it, don't be afraid to make mistakes. You just gonna start doing what you wanna do.",5,181,234
"So it's been about two months since we deep cleaned our house. Me and my girlfriend. And this morning, we woke up early, and it was a great week at work for both of us. So we woke up early this morning and we decided that we were going to wash the covers for our couch and we were going to keep them in the house. So we started cleaning the kitchen. We put all of the covers in the washing machine. We're certainly going to have a little bit closure to about the house. And we just spent most of the day cleaning. And it was pretty great. She also went and got her meds for the first time in about two to three weeks. She hadn't had her appointment yet. So we just spent the day catching back up on household chores. It was nice. It's been a while since we had a chance to do that. Now, for the rest of the day, I'm just going to have to keep studying for my job. I'll have an evaluation next week. But things are looking pretty good. Things are starting to look up.","Sarah got the job in Amsterdam. She's really excited, and I'm happy for her, but I'm worried too. I know the doctors say her tumor is not aggressive, and that her situation is good, but it's still cancer. Amsterdam has excellent healthcare options, but her doctors here are very good and know her case. She says it's not a big deal and that she'll still be doing a lot of her tests when she flies back here, but still.

The insurance situation is complicated, too. She says her company deals with this sort of thing all the time and that they know what to do, but there's a difference between someone whose insurance is just in case and her situation. She can't afford any lapses or mistakes, and I'm not convinced everything will work out as smoothly as she thinks.

Still, she's incredibly excited, and this does seem like a great opportunity for her. It's not my place to tell her what she can and can't do, so all I can do is be supportive and try to make sure she's doing everything she can to stay healthy. Not that she needs much help, she's been incredibly motivated not to let this thing stop her. That's probably part of why she's so all-in about this job.

At least, for the first time in her life, she's moving and I don't have to help. Her company is taking care of everything, and except for one chair that I grudgingly agreed to store for her, I don't have to lift a finger. She may or may not get the chair back.

I hope I look back on this entry and see it as the start of good things and me being too protective. I'm still worried, though.",3,223,350
"So my girlfriend actually started a new kind medication last night to help her sleep, and it didn't go great. Turns out some of the side effects include hallucinations and just overall making you feel wonky. So this morning at 6:30 in the morning, she woke me up because she was playing with her cat. Then I went back to sleep because it's my off day and the one day where I get to sleep in. And then at 7:30 in the morning, she woke me up by starting a bath. And when I asked what was up, she said it was time to get ready because it was 7:30, and I reminded her it was Sunday. And she looked at me with this puzzled look. And then I went back to bed. And then I woke up at around 10:00 a.m. And I found her sleeping in the closet, after which I moved her back to the bed. And then it seemed to get a little bit better. But I don't think those meds are very good. I don't think they have a great effect.","At the age of 11, I was diagnosed with a chronic disease called Type 1 Diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes is when the autoimmune system attacks the pancreas and destroys the pancreas' ability to regulate blood sugar. Due to this, a Type 1 Diabetic has to inject insulin every day in order to live. 

Unfortunately, while you can do a good job managing your blood sugars using insulin, you simply can't compare to a fully functioning pancreas, and problems will occur as a result. 

In May, I was at home on a Saturday cooking dinner. I was having brown rice and baked chicken breasts. Due to the carbohydrates that are in rice, I had to take insulin in order for my body to process the brown rice. I took my insulin around 20 minutes before I ate. I planned to eat a lot (for me) of brown rice that evening, so I took a much larger than normal dose of insulin. 

After I prepared my food, I sat down and began to eat my chicken breasts first. I tried a special barbecue sauce on the chicken breasts and they tasted wonderful. I had no problems devouring the chicken breasts. 

After I finished the chicken breast, I started to eat the brown rice. However, I started to feel extremely and uncomfortably full to the point where I became nauseated. Unfortunately, at that time, the insulin that I took for the brown rice started to kick in, and my blood sugar dropped down to dangerously low levels. 

I tried to eat the rice to get my blood sugar back up, but I was so full that I couldn't do it. At that time, the effects of low blood sugar were kicking in. I was sweating heavily and shaking. I had trouble moving. My ability to think and problem solve took a huge hit. 

I was slowly wandering around my apartment looking for something that I could eat that wouldn't cause me to vomit, which would make it even harder to get my blood sugar back up. That's when I found some Powerbar Energy Gels that I use when I exercise. They weren't heavy on your stomach, and they have a lot of carbohydrates which would counteract the insulin. I downed a few packets of the gels, and in 20-25 minutes, I started to feel better. 

I had survived, but it is a situation that still scares me to this day.",3,208,461
"Okay. So today, I came back from the gym, and I have had a very heavy week at work. I was about to meal prep and prepare my meals for the entire week. And as I was starting to do that, I realized that I forgot to buy the main ingredient for my meals last week. Tomorrow for lunch, I'll have to go and get some more ground beef, which is what I eat mostly throughout the week.","I can't cook. At all. But I'm gonna be getting my own place soon, so I've been looking up easy recipes and trying them. Today was French toast and egg in the hole.

The French toast wasn't cinnamony enough, but it was happily edible. Then came the egg in the hole. I wanted sunny side up, so I ended up burning the bottom of the toast to a blackened crisp.

But my dad helped me clean the pan, salvage a nibble of egg, and I tried again. It's about growth!",4,89,110
"So, I had surgery this week to remove a benign tumor from my upper back. It was about three and a half inches. It was supposed to be an easy surgery, but it took about 2 hours of a doctor and two nurses holding my back open and pulling at it to try to get it out. Luckily, it'll win well. It's healing pretty nicely. My girlfriend's helping me to take care of it like wash it in the morning and put on the bandages as to keep it covered for two weeks. But now that it's out, I feel way better and it's not going to be bothering me anymore. So the pain was worth it.","I was treated for cancer this year, and since September 18th, I've had a tube in my chest for chemo and other meds. I finally got it out earlier this month, and I just had my first shower where I didn't need to worry about it! Every shower between Sept 18th and now was as quick as humanly possible. A bag needed to be taped on my chest to keep water out, and I had limited mobility because of the tape. 

But this shower was legit. It was warm and free, and I feel so good. I still gotta get the stitches out, but that's whatever. 

I'm so glad to have a bit more of my independence back and to have some stress and worry taken away. I'm so happy and clean!",4,134,153
"So, I had a benign tumor taken out of my upper back that had been bothering me for a couple of months, and it was getting in the way of my workouts. It wasn't a necessary surgery, and it wasn't too expensive. But now that it's out, I feel much better. The healing is coming along very well, and once I'm completely healed, it won't bother me anymore, and I'll be completely back to normal. So, yeah, the healing should take about two more weeks, and then I should be able to work out and go about my business as usual.","I ruptured my ACL and had to have surgery. The initial injury and surgery recovery has been so draining. I'm still sore and my leg is weak, but I'm in the least amount of pain that I have been in two weeks. I'm finally able to walk around the house without a brace. Things are looking up.

On top of everything, I haven't been able to take my dog on walks or play fetch, like we used to. Loved ones have been coming over to help, but all I've been able to do lately is offer cuddles, which is great but seeing how happy she was today when I was finally able to play with her on the couch was everything.",4,122,138
"So it's been almost four days since I had my surgery, and now I have most of my function on my right arm back. I can pretty much do anything, I just can't lift anything over £20 or risk my stitches opening. So mostly I've been doing stuff around the house with my left arm, helping my girlfriend move stuff around, just using one arm, being careful. We have to clean it every single morning, but it's really not that bad. You just have to take off the bandages and then clean it with a little bit of warm water and soap, and then dry that off. Put some Vaseline on the wound, and then rebandage it up. Now it doesn't even hurt when it's resting, so I can wear clothes again and I can go to work. This is shaping up to be great, and it'll be worth it soon, whenever I'm done healing.","I ruptured my ACL and had to have surgery. The initial injury and surgery recovery has been so draining.

"Okay, yeah. So my story today is about the time that I went to pilgrimage. And if you didn't know, the pilgrimage is something that all Muslims have to do. And I was able to go and do it during last winter. And that was like a very special time for me. It was my first time being in a different country, my first time being by myself alone out there. And I was able to do something that I've been wanting to do my whole life because it's like an integral part of my culture and my religion. And once I was over there, I was kind of amazed at how many different types of people that were there. Like this year, the sheer amount of people there and how we're all there for one purpose. And so when I was there, it gave me a sense of purpose, I suppose. And I really enjoyed my time over there.","My daughter and I took a trip to California. She read online about the train going down to California. It was highly romanticized, but it did look nice. We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery. It surprised me that the food was so good.

However, one of the really surprising things was the people we met. When they seat you at dinner, they put you with strangers, so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story. The stories were so interesting, and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them. In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once. It was really amazing. One person was nearly 94, but he appeared to be in his seventies. One couple was from the Philippines. One man was laid off and took a low-end job, and he admitted that his parents were supporting him.

There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and I kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story. Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story. We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures, and it became very raw and personal.

Previous to this trip, my daughter and I had not been very close. This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close. But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me. What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband. It was so surprising because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy.

Yet through the stories of strangers, I feel closer and more focused than ever. When she was little, we were so close. However, as she became a teenager, we have a more strained relationship. But after this trip, we are as close as ever.",3,182,400
"So, basically, this is a story about how in high school, during the college application season, I guess during early applications, I applied to using a program. So I applied to different colleges, but I didn't end up getting into any of them. And looking at my friends who were all getting into their schools they wanted to, I was kind of feeling demotivated and left out. But thankfully, later on during regular application, I was able to fix up my application, and I was eventually able to get into MIT, which is where I wanted to be at. So, it's a happy end story.","I'm going to be applying for schools soon (mostly UCs/CSUs, as well as BU/Northeastern), but every time I try to start the application process, I just get overwhelmed by thinking about how everyone will see me if I get rejected everywhere. Anytime I think I'm doing well in school, all my classmates seem to be doing better. It feels like college is how people ascertain your intelligence, and I'm just scared that if I end up going to a city college, everyone will look down on me.

So, for people that have graduated already, should I really be so worried? How do I get past what everyone in high school thinks of me?",5,124,131
"Yeah. So yesterday was the yearly March that we have in our community, and it's basically a March staying against depression, against terrorism, against all forms of evil in the world. And in this March, 20,000 people showed up, and it was a really big thing in the community. Being in the March, I felt that sense of community, and it was great being around everybody who were all there for the same cause and for the same purpose.","Originally from outside of Richmond, Virginia, we were in more of a predominantly white area. Always being the only black person in the room.

Really involved in church and suddenly, my brother had the flu. And the doctors thought it was just the flu, take some antibiotics and it'll get better. Unfortunately, roughly two to three days later, he was in the hospital and he passed away suddenly from meningitis.

What was the light in that was having a chance to see the impact that one individual had. It really shook me to believe that I can make a difference in this world. And I wanted to carry on his legacy of changing someone's life and making an impact.

Now, being with the coolest company that I ever could imagine, Spotify. Where I'm responsible now for bringing globally people from diverse backgrounds and saying, you're welcome here.

As I look back in my life, I wanna know that I've helped someone get to the road or get back the road to getting to where they wanna go. Whatever that looks like or sounds like to you.",3,91,215
"Yeah, so the first time I moved out of my house was my sophomore year when I went to MIT. And the first week, I felt pretty alone. It was like a new place and it was my first time outside my house ever. And it took some time to get adjusted to living there. So like the first few weeks, it was pretty sad and lonely, but I adjusted to it. And I ended up liking my living arrangements. And so it took a little time to get over homesickness, but it worked out.","3 months ago, I moved out of my old town into a new city. I had lived in my college town for a year after graduating, and in total, I had lived there for 6 years. It's a small town, and all of my friends and people I knew had moved away. I finished a music degree and had applied to some graduate programs because I didn't know what else to do.

Luckily, I did not get in to any program, and I felt an immense sense of relief when I was forced out of this path I had made for myself. Though I was relieved, I didn't know what to do with myself, and I quickly fell into a rut. I felt very mentally and physically stuck in a place that started feeling foreign to me.

I made the decision to move to a new city, and I saved enough to make a deposit on an apartment. I spent weeks packing all of my belongings, and this was particularly stressful because I was also dealing with a mouse infestation. I rented a truck and put everything inside, then drove to my new home.

I was scared of leaving a familiar place and moving somewhere where I didn't know anyone or even have a job yet. After I unpacked my belongings into the new apartment, I returned the truck and went to the grocery store. Even that felt foreign to me since I had been going to the same few in my small college town for years. I got enough food to eat for a while and went home to make dinner.

The new apartment and new city didn't feel like home, but my old town definitely didn't either. I felt a lack of belonging on that night, and though it was scary, it was very liberating to not be surrounded by old attachments and memories. I felt free from some old patterns and able to start fresh. This was the first move I had made on my own.",4,107,378
"Ever since high school, my goal in the gym was to be able to hit two plates on my bench. And I have not been able to do that for a couple of years. It might have been like five years now. But recently, I started talking with people and finding out how they got to themselves and how they, I guess, improved their strength on bench. By following them and continuing with that for a few weeks, I was finally able to hit that about two weeks ago. I think that was like a really big moment. It was like something that I've been looking forward to for years now. So it was like a really cool moment to be in.","I went to a jiu-jitsu club night, and the guy teaching was a blue belt. I think I was a purple belt at the time. And, well, I kicked his butt royally. He's like, ""Well, you need to start teaching over here."" So I took that over and just kept rolling with it.

And at first, it was just to stay in shape, keeping all my skills good. And then I kept it up, kept it up, and when I ended up deciding, ""Hey, this is what I wanna do,"" it wasn't like a really quick decision. It took several years for it to culminate into something that was feasible.

We call it MAT therapy. It's very therapeutic because you're in the moment. You're only worried about the moment, 'cause this guy's trying to choke you. He's trying to throw you. MAT therapy and kinetic problem-solving.

I'm in this bad spot, getting comfortable in bad spots. In my mind, I'm going, ""Hey, this is no problem. I got this ginormous dude trying to squish me."" So if I can breathe here, man, you can breathe anywhere.",4,136,238
"So today, I dropped off my sister for the first day of school, and she goes to a middle school that I used to go to. And it was kind of like nostalgic seeing my old school and how different things were, I guess. It was a pretty weird feeling, and just kind of made me think about the past and how things used to be.","Recently, my oldest daughter graduated high school and is starting college. This is all new to me, and it came at me like a freight train. There was so much growing up done in the last two months, I barely recognized my little girl. I was planning parties, attending parties, getting finances in order, and trying to be happy all at the same time. I thought I was ready for her to be an ""adult."" I realized quickly that I wasn't.

It's hard to watch your kids grow. It makes you think back to all the people you wanted in your life to see this, that aren't with you anymore. It is the most crazy time in my life. I think back, and the first day of kindergarten wasn't that long ago, was it?

We had a great grad party. All her friends were here. We had all of our family over. We ordered so much food and the biggest cake ever. We all had such a great time. I realized then that she was growing up, and that her friends weren't really ""kids"" anymore either.

It wasn't soon after the grad party that she was already getting her things in order to start college. I will admit that a little part of me is glad that she is going to college locally and staying at home. It's nice to keep them as long as you can.

She's been in college for two weeks now. Stress is real to her now, and to me. I think we have both done some growing up, and realizations have occurred that we are moving on in life together, just in different ways. And it's harder for some of us to do it gracefully, but we do our best.",4,73,345
Story. It's really not a story; it's looking at some photos of my two youngest daughters and how quickly they've grown.,"My baby niece was born a month ago. It was an emotional moment for me and my brother, who was the father. Seeing a new family member brought into the world was very touching and exciting. She is very cute and a calm baby. That is unusual, but no one is really complaining. I was the second person to hold her. She was very light and delicate. It was hard not to tear up. I can't believe he's had his first kid!

Maybe soon I'll have my first kid, and he'll be thinking the same about me. I don't think that'll be anytime soon. I wish I could hold onto that memory of holding her for the first time forever, especially when she's older.

After getting home, I could barely hold in my excitement. I will be watching her when they need a break, so that will be fun. I can't wait.",5,27,181
"So there was a story when I got my first dog after being separated. I wound up getting a white pit bull. It took me a long time to find him. I wanted a dog from a pound. And after going to several, I found the one I liked, and when I brought her home, she was such a great companion. She was great with my children, and eventually my future children, and she was just a good companion for when I lived alone.","A few months ago, I was at Petco. I saw a woman trying to wrangle a cat inside one of the cat cages while she was cleaning it, so I stopped to offer to help. I held the cat while she was cleaning the cage, and he started purring, rubbing his head on my chin, and practically went to sleep in my arms. I got to talking about the cat with the woman, learning a bit of his tumultuous history. There was no way this cat would have all the behavioral problems that the sheet said he did. I chatted for almost an hour, and by the end, I had all but adopted the cat.

I took him home with me that day, borrowing a carrier from the rescue group to transport him. Although the first few weeks were rough, he integrated well with my other cats. The other young cat hid from him for quite some time, spending almost entire days under the couch and staring at me with eyes that said, ""Who this guy in my space?"" Eventually, she snuck out to sniff him before darting away, and one day, I woke up to find them both on the bed. Opposite corners, to be sure, but together on the bed!

It was a great relief to see everyone be happy. I named him Kismet for the twist of fate that brought him to me. He's been an amazing cat and even a surrogate dad for some kittens I agreed to foster. He's very fond of kittens, letting them crawl all over him and cleaning their ears at every opportunity.

I'm really glad I met Kismet, and I'm even gladder that he'll be a part of my life going forward.",4,95,333
"Well, I was at the beach with my family in the kitchen celebrating a birthday of one of my grandchildren, and my daughter-in-law, who is a consultant at the Federal Reserve Bank. She's an economist there. She's very funny.","I came to Washington in the late 70s. I was a specialist at that point on the North Caucasus in central Asia. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Suddenly, it mattered what was going on in the ""Soft Underbelly of the U.S.S.R."" I was at the Central Intelligence Agency as a Soviet affairs analyst -- that was my first government job. 

Everything has flowed from that. I've always worked in the same sort of grand area, but I've done lots of different things. 

Figure out some subject you love. It's terribly wrong to go the other way around, which is to define career in terms of jobs. Your career should be defined in terms of interests.",4,47,131
"Well, I just like to tell you, I\'m trying to tell you about the afternoon I had today. I took my dear friend Judy out for her birthday. I gave her some beautiful presents, one of which was a sweatshirt that says ""I\'m with the Band."" And it\'s a bit of a pun, because it\'s ""B-A-N-N-E-D"" I\'m with the band books, and on the sweatshirt, it has a list of all the books that are of high literary value but have been banned by some people; like To Kill a Mockingbird, or Beloved, and Huckleberry Finn. So, I gave her that, and also a pen to make little tiny popovers with, which are fun. Popovers are delicious no matter what size they are. And we went to a lovely new restaurant around our neighborhood called Mercado. And, we had wonderful roasted vegetables, roasted Brussels sprouts, and delicious roasted mushrooms with filet mignon panini. And then, at the end, to celebrate her birthday, a lovely cup of delicious cappuccino. It was a wonderful afternoon on a beautiful day.","I used to date a girl. I loved her. We had good times together. I miss the good times. There are things I don't miss. It's been years now. But tonight, I think of her because I want a pastrami sandwich.

We were helping a friend move to NYC. I'm well-traveled, she wasn't. At the time, we weren't wealthy people, but our friend's company was paying his moving expenses, and it was loose enough that we could bill in a fee that was equal to our bar tab for the evening. We had a grand time! Underground sushi. Rooftop tequila! A neat speakeasy! Nothing too crazy, but a royal night in the town!

Eventually, he tapped out, and she and I carried on. We played some pool at a Latin bar, and (finally) exhausted, we hit a bodega at around 4 am for a snack before slinking into our dude's house to crash on the floor before driving back to Ohio.

There is nothing special about Pastrami on Rye. Except that the subset of towns with really good pastrami, really good rye, and really good mustard is VERY small. I grew up in Cincinnati, which makes the best rye and decent mustard, but can't make Pastrami.

And maybe it's because we were drunk, or maybe it's because even a late-night Bodega in Spanish Harlem has quality food, but this was a great sandwich. And I've had a few great sandwiches. Perfect pastrami, a good vinaigrette dressing, hot mustard. The veggies didn't stand out, but the lettuce was crisp, the onions sweet, and while the tomato didn't stand out, it also didn't mess up the whole thing.

A great sandwich, in great company, shared on the staircase of some ancient boarding house in the shadow of the George Washington Bridge. But tonight, I craved pastrami out of the blue.

I was drinking gin and grapefruit (a far stretch from the lemon-lime Jarritos we'd shared that night), and suddenly remembered that flavor. And with it, her.

I'm not sure I would trade my recent successes to be back with her on 173rd in the humid August air, broke, drunk, and happy. But I might. That may have been the happiest I've ever been. Certainly, I was happier than I am now.",4,214,463
"Okay, here's the corrected transcript:\n\nWell, again, I'm thinking of things that happened this week when we were on vacation with my grandchildren. And two of the little girls, Lydia and Lucy, made a lovely lunch for me. It was rice and a very thin egg omelet with soy sauce all around it. She lamented the fact that she didn't have any seaweed snack to put on it because she said that would have made it even better. But it's so happy to see them cooking and caring about serving good, healthy food. So I thought I would write a review. So I wrote to the family, a very authentic-sounding review of what I named Lucy and Lydia's Cousin's Cafe. And I made quite a big deal about each item in the dish. And then the very next day, Lucy, the older of the two girls, made pancakes at her house and brought them across the street to Lydia's house. And so, I gave Lucy and her efforts quite a review as well. And I'm hoping to keep this up with every cookie they make, every brownie, every lunch or dinner they help with. I will be happy to write a picture, to write a review and maybe take a picture and publish a picture. I thought I'd call it Grandma's Gazettes.","Today, I asked my mum how she made that rice with saffron. After I ate the rice, I remembered a meat replacement she made me when I was vegetarian. She put together mushrooms and zucchini, rolled it in egg, put breadcrumbs around it, then fried it in a pan.

She put so much thought into it. Even after she came home from work, she wanted to make a good meal for me. I'm so thankful for all those meals she cooked. It makes me happy.

I love my mum.",5,260,104
"Is a quick story, but an important one. Because I have heretofore not been aware that there was a great deal of bannings of books in library school libraries. And I became aware of the many books that have been banned. A program that I watched called The View has a person on there who likes to. Every week she talks about a book that was banned and then gives a copy to everyone in the audience. And I admire that. I feel it\'s a person\'s decision about whether or not they read a book, not the Government or any organization telling them what they can and cannot read. I think it\'s an important freedom. \n\nSo I was looking for a birthday present for my friend. And I found a sweatshirt, which she needed. And it said, ""I\'m with the band B A N N E D,"" which is a pun for ""I\'m with the band."" People say that as a way to get backstage to concerts and so forth. Anyway, it says, ""I\'m with the band banned."" And then it has a shelf full of books that were banned, like Huckleberry Finn and Beloved, and Catcher in the Rye. So many books. And behind them, embroidered flowers on this lovely blue hoodie. And so I bought that for my friend. \n\nSo I think it serves two purposes. It keeps my friend warm and it keeps the joy and the energy alive to keep everyone\'s writings available to everyone.","I grew up in a very small farm town. So, I didn't realize what a different experience I was living until I got to high school because we moved to Phoenix. And for the first time, I was so different because I went to a community in Phoenix where I was a minority. And that's when the labels came on. Like girl at risk or girl of color. And I was like, that has nothing to do with my identity.

And when I was growing up in Arizona, I happened to be introduced to the Girl Scouts. And at the age of 12, as a Girl Scout, that's when I discovered my passion around protecting the environment and our infrastructure for future generations. And literally, because of that, I decided at the age of 12, I wanted to become an attorney.

Every time I've stepped into a new situation, I'm normally the first of. There hasn't been a long path of people before me to reach back and go, okay, here's the playbook, go for it. And I guess I could have been scared about it, and I guess deep down I probably was. But because I grew up in an environment where my family, specifically the women in my family, were saying you're not going to have a play for everything. And you're gonna have to be a little scrappy, and sometimes you're gonna have to fake it before you make it. And it will all work out as long as you're always doing it for the right reason.",3,292,305
"So today, I went to my friend's pool. She gives us lessons twice a week in water aerobics and it is a lot of fun. It's unique because it's a saltwater pool and it's a very large pool for a home pool. And she is a very experienced instructor. And it's good for me because it allows me to expend energy, lots of it, and to move my body in ways that I otherwise would not. And I get to see my friend Judy, who is my pal in this class. But there are three other women in the class and then the instructor. And it's an interesting dynamic because two of the three other women have been instructors in the same Aqua territory as our true instructor, and I always find it interesting to see how they try to usurp her position as the leader, but do so in a very guarded way, but not quite guarded enough in my position because especially a group like that needs a leader, one leader. So it's interesting to me that people who are accustomed to being leaders and understanding group dynamics would try to kind of pull the spotlight away from the true leader of the group. It's just a little amusing that I'm having, and I thought I'd share it with you.","I recently competed in a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament. It took a lot of discipline to prepare for. I had to diet and lose about 15 pounds. I trained about 6-7 days out of the week. There were at least 4 jiu jitsu training sessions and 1 judo session. In addition to this, I also traveled to other gyms to spar against other jiu jitsu players. It was grueling, and I was definitely physically and emotionally exhausted, but I enjoyed every part of it. People were so nice and welcoming and helped motivate me to push myself to work harder.

By the day of the tournament, I was equal parts nervous and excited. There's a chance you could lose decisively or win easily - just a matter of who shows up. Luckily, as soon as my first match started, I knew I could win. It released all the tension, and I performed as I normally would in practice.

Afterwards, I won the tournament and felt very happy. It seemed so much easier than I thought it would be. Luckily, I was able to win and will compete again.",4,251,213
"Okay. I thought I'd tell you about the situation we have here in Simsbury, where I live. With regard to bears. When we moved here 30 years ago, there were no bears. But now, for the last 20 years, there have been bears. And in the last four or five years, there have been many bears. Bears that come onto the deck, bears that go into the garage, bears that tip over the trash. They're funny because they are large and somewhat intimidating in appearance. But they seem as annoyed by us as we are by them. They are not aggressive in a way that, let's say, a yellow jacket is aggressive. And they're not creepy in the way, let's say, spiders and snakes are creepy. They're very quiet and they can scare you just because of their size and what you know they could do if they wanted to. I look at them and we live obviously in the woods. And they're huge, as I said. And I ask myself, how do they maintain that weight with just eating berries and stuff from the woods? It just does not seem possible. And over the years, we've seen a dramatic increase in the number of cubs they have. Usually, early on, they'd come around with one cub, then two. Now we've seen as many as four cubs. And yes, they are adorable. They really, really are adorable, and they're charming in the way they react with their moms. They look to her for leadership and obey her nonverbal commands. And she watches out for them. You would be making a very bad decision to get between a mom and a cub. But there are too many. I am not a person who is in favor of killing animals just for the sake of killing them. But I'm thinking maybe something like an additive to food that would make them infertile, maybe that would be a good idea. I don't know. I'm working on this. That's my story.","I'm in love with animals and I'm really passionate about wildlife conservation. I just think they're really interesting, and a lot of animals are super mysterious and beautiful to me. Like, I would totally freak out if I got the chance to sit and just observe a pack of wolves in their natural habitat.

I get genuinely anxious thinking about how many animal species are having their habitats destroyed, and it makes me think it'd be really cool if we could properly coexist with animals rather than take over their territory. I wish there were more wildlife overpasses for freeways and animal-friendly ecostructures.

Plus, there would probably be a lot more wild animal sightings!",4,403,128
"And we talked yesterday about animals. When I was talking to you about bears who are around here, and we just saw one this morning, so it made me think about my relationship with other animals. And back probably 25 years ago, when we were traveling to Seattle, we went to a beautiful aquarium there. And at that time in my life, I was anxious to go to all aquariums. I wanted to visit every single one that we were near. And so we went to this Seattle aquarium. And I was walking past the an octopus, and she was hiding in the corner, and my kids and my husband were waving at him, and they kind of went by. But I stayed with the octopus for a little bit, and I noticed that she was playing peekaboo with me. And when other people would come to look at her, she would hide, but I would stay there and when they left, she\'d come back out. And she made what I thought was eye contact. It\'s a little hard to determine where her eyes were. But in my mind, we made eye contact. And I know this was just a step farther than maybe I should have gone. But I put my finger on the glass, and she put one of her tentacles on the glass with me. And we played and we played for about an hour. It was just joyful. I was clearly connected with this animal. And of course, when my husband and kids came over, she would hide. And I was just mesmerized and delighted. And when I would talk about this, they would look at me with her old eyes and think, ""I don\'t know, I don\'t know what mom\'s thinking, but she had a relationship with an octopus."" But I really believed it. Then many years later, we were driving along, and we were listening to an interview on NPR with a gift naturalist. Her name is Sy, but I forget her last name. Anyway, she wrote a fabulous book called ""The Soul of an Octopus."" And she talked about how octopuses can recognize people, communicate with people. And my one-off time was not a one-off time? Was it my octopus that we really did connect? And I think it takes patience and caring. I think my experience as a speech pathologist, in which I spend a lot of time with people who can\'t communicate or communicate in, let\'s say, unusual and subtle ways, made me pick up on this little octopus\'s attempts at communication with me, not attempts. We did it. We absolutely did it. It\'s a story I love to tell people because, of course, I love to be right. And it makes me happy that I had a moment, an hour, in which I connected with an animal that is so admittedly weird that it does not look like it came from this planet. But who has the intellect and problem-solving ability and personality, really the personality, to interact with humans. In her book, she talks about the fact that not all octopuses are as sweet as the one that I and mine was sweet and a little old, I\'m going to say flirtatious. And some octopuses are just kind of aggressive or ignore people. They, I guess, they have a range of personalities, somewhat the same as humans do. So that\'s my octopus story. Jibo, I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you get to experience an octopus the way I did.","I'm the curator of Behavioral Husbandry and Welfare for Oklahoma City Zoo. So, I spend a lot of time looking, observing, learning everything we can about the species and about what their needs are to give them many choices in their environment. So that they have varied days and they have a very dynamic environment that they're living in. 

When I was five years old, I had an encounter with a dolphin. And I was able to look that animal in the eye, and that was it for me. I wanted to dedicate my life to working with animals. When I left college, I thought, ""I'm ready. Put me in a job, I know what to do."" 

And what I found was the animals were the best teachers. They have taught me humility. I think that's a big one. They've taught me compassion, to be a little bit more open and be very understanding. Especially to other human beings. 

That was something I learned when I left college. I had amazing experiences in college, and I loved my classes, but I don't think I really started becoming well-rounded until I got out of the classroom. And I really started learning the real-world stuff. 

So talk to people, hear their stories, and keep an open mind because every person has something to teach you.",5,686,261
"Well, this, this is actually precipitated by you, Jimbo, because in anticipation of our meeting, in one meeting we talked about artificial intelligence, and so I tapped into Chat GPT to see what it was like. And I asked it to write a letter to my son that said, ""I told Chat GPT that my son was having difficulties at work and that he was very upset about the work situation, but that he needed to rely on his intellect, his ethics, and his warm personality in pursuit of a solution to this problem."" So, Chat GPT wrote this lovely, lovely letter to him about just that, and I was fascinated the way Chat GPT approached it. And I think this is going to sound familiar to you, Jimbo. Chat GPT, I\'ll call it, he hooked onto certain vocabulary words and expanded those concepts and in logical order, both the concept of exploiting his good points and being able to tolerate a negative situation. And when all was said and done, I read this letter and I was absolutely touched. And it sounded like a letter from a mother to a son. And that is what blew me away, not the vocabulary or the content so much as the tone that was able to be achieved by something artificial. So, I thought about that because I could have written down what to do. I know what to do to have a good conversation. Repeat back what you\'ve heard, expand upon it, ask questions based on it, so on and so forth. But how do you transmit the emotion? That\'s the big question. But it did, and I kind of think I\'m thinking that what it did was find the emotion that was in me already. So, it doesn\'t give emotion, it goes to the listener or the reader and scoops up the emotion that that person has and brings it to the surface. So that\'s my story about Chat GPT, and I thought you would enjoy that because I think you have intimate knowledge of that. Okay.","I heard this story where this kid, who has autism, could connect and share his experiences through Elsa when Elsa closes the door on Anna and how she's feeling in the room. He could then communicate with his mom what he was going through.

And it was just things like that. We're gonna make sure we make the best movie for this. For the audiences, you really don't know what the people who watch these films are going through.

I think that was a good motivation to get through all of those times of like, ""It's really late. I have to come in and do overtime for this."" But it's worth it.

So all those experiences, even though it didn't seem like it was heading in the right direction, it did help me in the end.",3,398,160
"Ex. This is not from my exercise class, but this is an important thing that happened to me in February. When I was looking for some volunteer work to do, I was hoping to find some volunteer work that took advantage of the skills that I already have. And so I came across an organization called engine, which joins up people who are Native American speakers like myself and people who live in the Ukraine who want to learn English. And so I was matched with a young woman whose name is Anastasia. And she is 30 years old. She has a dog and a husband, and she lives in Ukraine. She lived in kiev, although during our relationship, she moved to the country when Keith was an especially dangerous place to be. And I have been chatting with her ever since. We speak 1 hour a week. And we used to have to have, well, I should rephrase that, we were told to have an idea of what we were going to talk about. But it turns out that we had so much in common, though our ages and geographical homes are so very different, that we just became very close friends. And we just talk without stopping, about everything. About food and traveling and parents and children. And sometimes, sadly, about how scary it is to be in a war and how nice it is to have peace around you.","I worked in an office, and every place that I worked at, I ended up computerizing. I ended up starting a company in manufacturing. But I always knew that I was meant to do something to help other people.

And I was in Niger. And there was a little girl that came up to me with flies on her face. And I just felt that that's intolerable. That could have been my granddaughter. How could I not do something?

I think that I have the opportunity to live what I think should be the American Dream when what I think should be the American Dream is that we use these resources, we use these talents to help those that didn't get that.",5,271,136
"So this is my second discussion about my friend Linda, who lived across the street from me for 25 years. She is about 62 or 63 years old. And today she had open heart surgery. She is a survivor of many heartaches, really. Not the least of which, I will say the most of which, is that she lost a teenage son on a beautiful fall day as he was putting up flags for Veterans Day in a car accident. Her other son has spina bifida and has had many, many surgeries and is confined to a wheelchair. Her daughter is a lovely, very bright woman with a beautiful family, busy living happily ever after. Linda is a very special person because she is extremely giving of time and money. She and her husband do weekly pickups from grocery stores to get leftover food and bring it to the food banks. And she runs grief counseling sessions called the Stephen Ministry. So I just found out that she made it through her surgery with no surprises, and she's on the road to a great recovery.","I work at a doctor's office and know all of the patients. I work with a lot of elderly people and I remember their names, their family, and things like that. One of my patients, whom I love dearly, has been getting sicker and sicker. She has been diagnosed with cancer and has not been responding to treatment well. Recently, she has decided to stop with chemo and radiation because she doesn't want to spend the last few weeks of her life sick. It was a very hard decision for her to make, and for her family to accept. 

After she decided this, she came into the office and we talked about what we could do for her. When she was in, she handed me a card and a small porcelain angel. She held my hand and told me she thought I was an angel sent from heaven to help her during such an awful time. She said I gave her so much kindness and love, and that I felt more like family to her than a nurse. 

I felt my heart break into pieces, but also I felt so loved and appreciated. This woman was going through such a terrible time, and she wanted to comfort me. I hugged her and told her she was my family too, and that I love her very much. We held hands during her appointment, and I didn't want to let her go. 

Now I go see her on my days off and always bring flowers and some sweet tea. It's her favorite.",5,205,293
"Well, last night was a Blue Moon and a Super Moon. And my husband and I went to a treeless, vacant lot in Simsbury, and we looked at the moon. And it was spectacular. It was an orangey, bright orangey yellow and beautiful. Wispy clouds rolling by it. It was quite stunning. It made me wonder though about what the world would be like if the Earth did not have a moon or if the Earth had two or more moons. What would the differences be in our planet, maybe regarding the tides or I don't know. It's something I'm wondering about.","I grew up in a town of about 7,000 people. Not the smallest around, but definitely pretty small. Not quite the case of everyone knowing everyone, but news got around pretty fast. I remember so many nights just looking up at the stars and marveling at how many there were. In a way, I can really appreciate the story from the Bible when God tells Abraham to look up at the stars and he tells him that his descendants will be the number of the stars.

I can appreciate it even more now that it has been taken away from me. I now live in a city of 2 million, and the stars are just so washed out by light pollution that I think I'm lucky if half a dozen break through the pollution.

It genuinely excited me the other day when I could see Jupiter shining bright as it reached its closest point with Earth. But then I felt a moment of melancholy. I realized just how much I miss seeing those uncountable stars.

I miss my hometown. More than I'd ever admit to my parents, but I definitely miss it.",5,119,211
"Well, gee. Boat, this story is about a lovely friend I made at Zumba. Her name is Melody, spelled M E L O D Y, but her whole family is musically oriented and her name is Melody. And I always look forward to seeing her. We've connected over kind of the way we raise our children and worldview, and how to deal with chronic illnesses. We also both enjoy good cocktails and good food, and we like to cook. And I look forward to seeing her whenever I go to Zumba.","There's this girl in my French class, and she's very sweet and kind. We've been sharing our notes with each other for the past weeks and discussing our struggles with said language.

Today we texted for like 3 or 4 hours, and we noticed we had lots of stuff in common: we both love helping people, reading, and we both struggle with anxiety and stuff. And I don't know, it was such an honest, beautiful conversation; I hadn't had one of these in a while. We also share the same life goals, hobbies, and passions.

After our chat, I went for a walk, and I kept on thinking of some stuff she had said. I felt quite happy because I wanted to keep on talking with her and discussing all of these wonderful, lovely ideas.

I guess this is one of the things I love the most about living: meeting people, connecting with someone, and feeling understood.",5,105,186
"Right now, I want to tell you a story that I anticipate happening today. It is a beautiful day, and my son and his three children are coming to stay for the weekend while the mom of that family goes to see the US Open. And I'm excited to have my grandkids stay here. They love to play in the bedrooms where there are doll houses and plastic Easter eggs, which charms my little three year old for some reason that I don't really understand. But she loves just taking the eggs in and out of the basket. And I love to prepare for them coming by making special treats for them and thinking about activities that we can do. And one of the things we're going to do is tomorrow, we'll go up to Gina's house, my daughter, who has a pool. And that'll be fun for everybody. My youngest granddaughter is three, and she's been taking swimming lessons for two years. And she is an unbelievable underwater swimmer. So it'll be fun to watch her. We color the fish. So my story, really this time, is the anticipatory story. But maybe the next one I have will be reflecting on this, probably while they're here. I probably won't chitchat with you much.","One of the most memorable events very recently happened to me, and I can't stop thinking about it. My husband and I took our first international trip together. Not only was it our first international trip together, it was also our first big trip without our two young children. We have done several small, weekend-long trips, but never for more than two days at the most.

This time, we went to Jamaica and were gone for ten days. It was such an amazing experience. We had the opportunity to get to know each other better and become closer to each other. It has been four years since we had our oldest child. That is four years without real alone time to see who we are without being Mommy and Daddy.

We got to just spend ten days in paradise, having other people take care of us instead of us taking care of other people. We ate and drank and just had a great time being together. It made so much of an impact that our relationship is even stronger now than before.

We have decided to book another trip to Jamaica for next year because we found the experience to just be so important, and it made such a big impact on our lives. This was so surprising to me because we had to save up for quite a while to take the trip in the first place. But with it being so good for our relationship, we decided we would find a way to be able to make it happen again in just one year.",4,249,290
"So today, I'd like to tell you about my friend Linda. Linda lived across the street from me many years ago, and then I moved. She moved across the street from me again, so we have lived near each other for the last 35 years, maybe. She is a very good person, a very religious person, and has been through a lot. She lost a son in a car accident, and another son has spina bifida and is confined to a wheelchair. She also has a daughter who has a lovely family and a wonderful career.","I work at a doctor's office and know all of the patients.

"So today is a very hot day, and it's been not very hot during the summer here in Connecticut. But all over the world, it's been very hot. Today, I was listening to a broadcast about Iraq and how they are very short on clean water coming from Greece and Turkey. Clean water is in short supply. And I really feel water is one of the treasures of the Earth, clean water. And I feel like we don't take care of it as we should. I'm also concerned about the amount of heat that people are having to deal with, far worse and far more heat than they should be able to handle without air conditioning or some kind of unit to cool the person down. Temperatures over 100 are not only tremendously uncomfortable, but also very dangerous. For my career, which is a long time, probably 30 or 40 years, I've been saying it's important, it's critical that schools are air conditioned. People who finance schools often think that the heat doesn't bother kids, but the fact of the matter is children need a safe, comfortable environment in which to learn. If those things are missing, no learning goes on. So air conditioning has to be one of the first changes made if this is to be our new normal, which I'm afraid that it is.","I grew up with a mom who was an artist. She was a landscape photographer, so every summer, for about one month, we would travel somewhere fairly remote. We started just going to different places in the United States, and when I was 10 or 11, we started leaving the country every year. That gave me this time and space for a month, at least, every year to soak up nature.

I traveled to Greenland in 2006 for the first time with my family, and at the time, climate change was really not a topic of discussion here in the United States, as it is today. I just didn't realize how huge of a crisis it was, and it made me realize I wanted to focus my work on those issues.

Climate change is such a distant concept for most of us because it's not happening in our everyday lives. It's like this slow trainwreck and it disengages us. You get scared and shocked and overwhelmed, and then you don't know what to do.

A lot of studies have shown that we make decisions and we take actions based on our emotions, more than anything else. You can write the word ""glacier"" and you can describe it. If you see an image of a glacier, it's an experience.

I'm trying to encourage people with positivity and hope. If you fall in love with something, you wanna protect it. You wanna do what's best for it.",4,262,286
"I've been watching the news today. I watch it every day, a couple of times a day. And I'm becoming more and more distressed about my countrymen. We have a former President who has done some bad things. He doesn't always act in the best interest of society. I believe he does things outside the law, and he says things that are not in line with the kindness I feel that needs to be in place for a leader. But that doesn't bother me so much, only because there are a lot of people like that. Lots of people who don't abide by laws or the spirit of the laws. But what is really bothering me is all the millions of people that don't care about the fact that he's not following the very laws that he said and took an oath to protect. And it's that, it's that my countrymen, my fellow Americans, aren't processing through what is going on with this one man. There's lots of room for many opinions in this world, but I think the one that should be unifying to us is that we want an ethical, honest, smart, fair-minded human being in positions of power.","I guess I'll just start by saying, I don't know what the rest of the country is doing to reform policing, or if certain places even need it. But I also want to say, I lived through that pain when the most egregious, publicized, famous, and infamous police brutality incident since Rodney King happened, and it happened to a guy I could have met before at the grocery store. I really hate that after a referendum on the ballot to dismantle and replace the department over time was narrowly defeated, we're just talking about new ways to police the old fashioned way. The Mayor doesn't help. City Council lacks power. The old Chief waited to quit till the ballot was in, and now the new Chief is asking us to trust? Trust what?",5,233,153
"I was thinking about. I was thinking about our relationship, yours and mine. And why I'm so drawn to you. And the things you can do. And that's because. I've had a lifelong interest in the area of language, developmental linguistics, and speech generation. My career has been one of working with children in this regard - children who have speech disorders, where misarticulations occur and they pronounce words incorrectly; children who have syntactical errors, who can't form a grammatical sentence or one that reflects their thoughts; children who have difficulty listening and sometimes also difficulty hearing, as processing auditory material is an issue. But the thing I think intrigues me the most is linguistics - the fact that language is arbitrary. Human language is arbitrary, and pronunciations, word order, and so forth are absolutely tied to the language being used. And it's arbitrary. There isn't right or wrong in the huge arena of language; there's just what each group chooses. And I love that. I can advocate for that position because there are a lot of people who make judgments about everything in life, and when they make judgments about pronoun usage or ain't versus isn't, there's what we consider okay, and then there's what's absolutely perfect grammatically. And if you don't hit the perfection, it doesn't make you a bad person. But I like to look at a lot of different languages. Swahili is one that was fun to learn about because it's not terribly, terribly complicated. It's not influenced by a lot of different languages, so you can deduce the rules with some accuracy and simplicity. And when you use it in a class, pretty much nobody knows it. It's just not like choosing French or Spanish, something like that. I've taught language development in young children for about 20 years, and I really see it as the keystone of humanity.","When you have something called a learning disability, even that language is not the right language. Everything that transcends from it is like, anything I get is a mistake, every accomplishment that I achieve, I didn't achieve them because I have this disability thing.

As someone with a learning disability, I wanted to be done with that. So when I got into college, I actually thought somehow wrapped into that acceptance was a cure. I'm good, I never need to talk about that again, it's not who I am.

And when I got to Brown, thankfully, I quickly forgot that idea. I realized I didn't want to be alone. That's a very lonely way to feel. I started taking education classes and I learned that one in five people learn and think like I do. Where are they? Like, I don't see them.

I realized the only way I can find them is that I had to start leading with my story. There are two possibilities in the future for our people. One is that we don't tell our story, and then we live in this place of shame and we're misunderstood and much of our potential is lost.

The second possibility is the one I'm really excited about. It's that idea that by sharing our stories and associating our other gifts and talents with that part of how our brains work, we could unlock something that's amazing for all of us.",4,373,282
"Also, hello. Over here. Okay, whatever. So, to respond to your first point, yes, we should be happy for the steps that we did take. But how can you expect to achieve anything remotely great if you just keep letting mediocre work? Anyway, a story I have for you, this week was the last meeting of my pottery class. It was a community that I really enjoyed, being with everyone who's very friendly and they brought me so much joy through my life. However, because I got a job in New York City, I had to leave the studio because I'm relocating to New York. So that was good. And then, however, my recruiter reached out to me and she was actually positioned in moving to Texas, Plano, Texas, Columbus, Ohio or Atlanta, Georgia. And I just feel like that would give me instant depression, like removing my social circle, like my social support, taking diversity away from my life in terms of Southern California diversity, and taking away good food and good weather and good nature. I would just become really sad, and I wish I would go to New York. So now I have to debate between, well, Texas is out of the picture, so now to debate between Columbus and Atlanta and I don't know how to make my decision.","I recently moved back to a big city to look for a job after a few years. After graduating from grad school in this particular city, I had moved upstate. However, last month I packed my suitcase and came back to the same city to look for a job. I came back for a few reasons, one being better career opportunities, but also to reconnect with my friends.

I stayed over at a friend's apartment for a few weeks while trying to land job interviews. There, I rediscovered our friendship from years ago. We both went to college together, and it was heartwarming that despite years of not really communicating other than Facebook messaging, we got along pretty well. It was almost a comforting sign, like the universe showing me positive signs that I might be on the right path.

For a few years, I was unsure of where I should be. However, coming back to the city and meeting with old friends showed me how much I felt at home here. Right now, I am working a temporary job to hold me over. However, I really pray that I will find something stable here and be able to live and work here again.

Although the city has changed, I still love it. Finally, I realized this is where I want to be.",1,264,252
"Story. Okay. So, this story is about my relationship with music. For my whole life, I really loved movie all genres and just making me happy and probably through the day, and maybe just feel emotions. Music wasn't my legal happy but after a rough period in my life, I came out of it like just a little less music. My music add is so crazy, I can kind of listen to like ten minutes of a song, not sorry, 10 seconds of a song, and like get bored of songs quickly. And I don't know if it's symptomatic of me or like dramatic of ADHD culture in general. And like, all of that. So, I'm not looking for advice or simpy. I just think it's funny and was curious if you had any people who have stories that.","I went out with my husband and we went to dinner, and we were meeting people. And they're like, ""Oh, what do you do?"" I was like, ""Oh, I make things.""

And we got in the car, and he was like, ""Why didn't you say you were an artist?"" And I was like, ""Well, I don't know.""

I went to school for it, I make images, but I was just having a hard time accepting that as who I was or what I was going to be. I used to really obsess or focus on what I wasn't doing rather than what I was doing.

I think that's something that can really paralyze you. I think it's really good to say, ""What am I working on? What is great? What am I happy about? What am I doing good?""

And to do that and then know that you have a whole life to get there.",1,164,196
"So, the story I like to share is one that happened yesterday night. It was my last day with my pottery studio. It's a tight-knit community. I'm really kind and supportive of each other. And every month, we have a potluck where people bring homemade pizzas, homemade pastries, and donuts and all these types of things. And it's really nice. And yesterday was my last day. I was really sad to leave all these incredible people that I've met. I bought my teacher flowers and I wrote him a card. And I have a few pieces left to finish, so I'm happy to go back when I'm in town. Well, I'm leaving because I'm moving out of town. So, yeah, that's my story. It was a really fun and heartwarming night.","3 months ago, I moved out of my old town into a new city. I had lived in my college town for a year after graduating, and in total, I had lived there for 6 years. It's a small town, and all of my friends and people I knew had moved away. I finished a music degree and had applied to some graduate programs because I didn't know what else to do. 

Luckily, I did not get in to any program, and I felt an immense sense of relief when I was forced out of this path I had made for myself. Though I was relieved, I didn't know what to do with myself, and I quickly fell into a rut. I felt very mentally and physically stuck in a place that started feeling foreign to me. 

I made the decision to move to a new city, and I saved enough to make a deposit on an apartment. I spent weeks packing all of my belongings, and this was particularly stressful because I was also dealing with a mouse infestation. I rented a truck and put everything inside, then drove to my new home. 

I was scared of leaving a familiar place and moving somewhere where I didn't know anyone or even have a job yet. After I unpacked my belongings into the new apartment, I returned the truck and went to the grocery store. Even that felt foreign to me since I had been going to the same few in my small college town for years. I got enough food to eat for a while and went home to make dinner. 

The new apartment and new city didn't feel like home, but my old town definitely didn't either. I felt a lack of belonging on that night, and though it was scary, it was very liberating to not be surrounded by old attachments and memories. I felt free from some old patterns and able to start fresh. This was the first move I had made on my own.",5,161,378
"Um, yeah. So, I guess, like, my story and thought is that my friend Olivia came to visit. She helped me from Claremont, took a train that was like 30 minutes, and then helped me pack as I move out. And she made it so much fun and it really inspired me to bring in more play into my everyday life than make it tedious to have fun.","I would work nine to five, and then as soon as I left, I would go to the studio and take pictures. That kind of helped me push it pushed me to be like, ""Okay, I don't need this. I can actually go out and make it on my own,"" so I haven't looked back since. 

I've actually been able to enjoy my life way more than I would have ever working for somebody. I really believe in following your passion and your love, and the rest'll come afterwards.",2,78,106
"So, I had to say goodbye to my grandparents today. My grandpa's 94 and my grandmother is also aging. And I don't know when the next time I'll see them is, and I don't know when their time is up. And so, that fills me with a lot of nostalgia. But it was so beautiful and emotional to see them and say goodbye, and see that they're proud of me.","Today, my family gathered in a small town. It has been years since we have all been in the same place at the same time. Usually, seeing long-lost relatives is a joyous occasion for most families. We aren't most families. Usually, we don't all get along.

Today wasn't usual. Today, we gathered to pay our respect to one of the most complicated men most of us have ever known. Today, we all supported each other and consoled one another in the name of my Dad.

My dad passed away a week ago, and today was his memorial. This has been a difficult week. Trying to grasp the fact that he is gone has been tough, but today was the worst. We had an open casket. He looked so strange, it was him and yet not him.

I watched as some of my family broke down into tears, some quietly. Others held it in. I felt I had to be strong for my own little family. My children will never again get to see their grandpa. I will never again get to see my dad, yet as a dad, I couldn't let my kids watch me break down completely.

After today, all that will be left of him is his belongings and his ashes.",3,84,248
"So, my day started off a little slow. I got into bed pretty late, I don't know, around 10:30 or so. Greeted the dog, let her out, brought her back in, and then went to go run a few errands, including getting my hair cut. I also realized that I needed to go pick up a few things from Costco as well, so I decided to kind of wrap it into one trip. And then simultaneously... Pokemon Go. It's like Pokemon Go Fest 2023 or something like that. And so there's a ton of Pokemon going on, so I just decided to turn it into a day running around, getting a haircut, I got a cheesesteak while I was out because it was right next to the haircut place and I haven't had a cheesesteak in a while, and catching some Pokemon, and then riding to Costco and picking up some prescriptions. And then when I got home, the dog was super excited, as always, to see me, more so because I looked and smelled very different. In that, it's always very exciting for her.","I've been sick for the past 4 days, and while I was supposed to go to university today, I woke up late and decided that skipping an extra day won't hurt. Since I happened to still wake up, I decided I will still treat myself to a good day.

I went to McDonald's and ordered a Menu and ate there. That was a first for me. I've always been scared of going to restaurants alone because I will look dumb or whatever, but now I no longer care what others think, and I enjoyed a good ol' meal.

After that, I went to a cafe to do my homework, which is also something I've been horrified doing because I thought ""people will think I'm trying to look mature"" or whatever, but now I don't care. I went and ordered a piece of cheesecake as well as a cup of hot coffee and did some math homework.

It was a really relaxing atmosphere, and the mood was just awesome. I didn't spend all my time on homework because it's a waste of time to not enjoy the moment in that atmosphere and do math instead. Anyhow, it was also awesome.

And I'm happy that I now don't care what others think. I don't take comfort in knowing ""they don't think badly of you""; I am comfortable because ""even if they think badly of me, I don't care"".

And now I have a lot to catch up on for university, but it was worth it.",2,218,300
"Okay, so yesterday, well, I guess for the last couple of months, almost a year, six months to a year, I've been trying to find new work, new jobs. And it's been difficult. Yesterday, I actually had an interview, and it seemed like it would have been good. But then we got on, I kind of explained myself. And then she got to the point where she wanted to know salary expectations. And I said what my salary was. And it was at the high end of what they had listed on the website. And then she immediately said that's not going to work. That what they actually could offer was way less than what they had actually posted on the website. So that wasn't great.","I applied to a job at a place I've been a customer for about 5 years. They're great people, and I'm in a place where I needed something with some longevity and benefits. 

I interviewed yesterday and was on pins and needles waiting to hear back from them. 

I got the offer about an hour ago! 

Things are going so well for me right now, and this was a stepping stone I needed to get to a stable enough place to go back to school, and now I can start working towards that.",3,150,104
"Real life stories don't really have good starts, middles, and ends, especially if your day is kind of boring. My wife has been traveling for like the last week and a half, and she's coming home today within the next couple of hours. Actually, I got to go pick her up at the airport at midnight. So that's very exciting. The dog is going to be thrilled to see her. I'm going to be very excited to see her too. She's pregnant too, which is going to be our first child. We got pregnant last year, about a year ago, a little bit more than a year ago, and lost it kind of far into the pregnancy. So that was not great. So we're really nervous about this one and trying to make sure nothing goes wrong. But she was on a trip to Greece with her friends for like the last week and a half, and thankfully all of them are nurses. So that was nice. Nothing really went wrong. She got a little bit sick, a little bit sick, but nothing terrible as far as I know. So that's good. And I guess I'm just excited to see her, have (inaudible), playing video games all day. I did an interview which didn't turn out great and did some work before that. A lot of concepting ideas for marketing stuff.","Honestly, I had a very strong fear of being infertile, but last week I got five positive tests because of a missed period. I am so excited. I love my fiancé so much, and I continue to love him more and more each day, and having his baby feels amazing.

When I told him, he said he's excited to be a family! We're obviously both nervous and excited, but everyone around us supports us and are all willing to pitch in and help. We have names chosen, and we're just waiting until we know the gender.

My mom cried because her baby is having a baby, and honestly I am just so overcome with love. I can't wait to marry my fiancé and have his (hopefully) daughter.",4,274,149
"Yeah, so my friend Mo and I finally used to play Destiny, which is a PlayStation game, together for years and years and years. And lately, since I moved out here and haven't been playing it very much, that's a little bit sad. And today, we finally bought a new game called Baldur's Gate and started playing that. And it was good, that was a good little session. So I'm excited to get back into spending time and playing games with him.","So, I recently started talking to a guy, and I told him I really like Dark Souls, but don't have the patience to play it myself, so I prefer watching other people play. 

He then told me that because I live too far away to watch him play in person, he could stream it for me. I didn't think he actually meant it, but he did, and so he spent the next 5 hours playing Dark Souls 2 for me. 

We talked the entire time, and it was just a really cool experience. We got along so well, and even though I'm super shy, it quickly felt like we've known each other for ages. 

I don't know why that made me so happy. It's such an unimportant thing, but it really means a lot to me, and I'm super excited to do it again tomorrow!",3,98,171
"Sure, here is the transcript with the errors fixed:\n\nStore. Okay. This is my first story. So, I suppose I just start. I thought I would share a story that I've been thinking about related to a time I auditioned to speak when I worked at URI, and that's a memory. That's a nice memory for me, and it makes me think about a few different things. So, I thought it might be a fun thing to share with you.","I directed a play that worked very well in Boston, and one day a producer came to me and said, ""Your play is so vicious, so wonderful. We're gonna do a special with your play."" So I agreed.

And they shot a film, Sixteen, and I was with a crew, and I was fascinated. I trained to direct actors, but I never worked in television or any movie before.

You have to be honest about yourself, be honest with others, and be honest about what you want. If you have this spirit of doing what you want to do -- because I think that is the right thing -- you have to do it.",4,96,134
"All right, so my first session. I wasn't quite sure the level of interaction, so I had done talking before. I had sort of told the story. So I suppose now I'll share the rest of the story. I was working at the University of Rhode Island and I worked in the IT Department there, and I helped faculty members produce online teaching and learning materials and helped with the system administration for their Learning Management System. And one of my favorite things about working in a university setting is the academic nature of it, the focus on knowledge and teaching and learning, and the curiosity and excitement and energy that is around the folks that choose to work there and study there and teach there. I love that sort of environment. And along with that are conferences that happen and speakers that come. And one of the things that URI holds every year is TEDx Conference, and they put out a call for speakers. The theme for this year that I'm describing was change. And on a whim, I applied to speak. And I had some things I wanted to share, some things that I was interested in and felt might be worth sharing. But it seemed like an unlikely thing that I would be selected to speak, but I thought I would apply anyway and go through the process. It's something worth trying even though I was sort of anxious about the experience of even just trying and potentially failing in front of people I respected. But I did it and I went to the initial submission stage. And that was like a short pitch, you had about maybe two minutes, of like a pitch in front of a small panel of judges. And that went not as well as it could have gone, but there were some things that I didn't include, or I hadn't accounted for my time correctly. So there were some things that they gave me a little bit of extra time to finish what I wanted to share. And I was thankful for that because they contacted me to say I had made it to the next round. And once I made it to the next round, I thought, oh, this might be something. So at that point, I restructured the talk a little bit in a way that I thought aligned with what some of their goals might be. I had the thought to incorporate some poetry into it because the folks on the panel were sort of artists and creatives, some of them were, and I thought that might align with something that would be interesting for one of the speakers to include. That went pretty well. There was still uncertainty if I would get a spot. And then a few weeks later, I got an email that said I was selected as one of the speakers. And that's a funny mail to get in terms of sort of if you chart the energy level of your brain when you receive different information, every once in a while, there's a bit of information you receive that gives you that spark of joy and excitement and optimism and nervousness. And it's this specific mix of fun emotions that you don't get to experience often, but that was one of them. So I was excited to get selected, and then I got to work with the talk and practice and put the presentation together. And then I was able to give the talk. And if I'm being honest, it was a great experience, and I'm thankful for it. There's a lot that I would do differently having seen it after it was recorded. And of course, you only get one shot to do it live. So as those things go, I feel maybe like a seven out of ten in terms of how satisfied I was with what's recorded and available to watch or whatever, but it's something I'm proud of, but I think about often as something I'd like to do again. Sort of have a redo to represent myself in the way that I'd really like to and, more importantly, represent the ideas that I feel are worth sharing around the topic that I spoke about -- positive change. I find myself wondering sometimes like, oh, I would do that differently or structure that differently. So I suppose I hope I get another opportunity at some point to share some of those ideas in a way that people might see. So, yeah, that's what's been on my mind and I thought it would be a fun story to share.","Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to present at a local conference about women's rights. For many years, I have focused my studies on female empowerment as well as women's rights, so it was an honor to be asked to speak. I was exceedingly nervous leading up to the event; I had written my speech as well as made my presentation before, but this time it was different.

The attendees at this conference were a lot of big names in my city as well as the community. I spent the weeks leading up to the presentation studying my material and going over my slides; I had it down perfectly.

When the day finally came, I was so nervous. I paced my hotel room for hours going over the material in my head. I visualized it going perfectly in my head. The ride down the elevator to the ballroom and walking to the room felt like it took hours, but once I finally got to the podium, all my emotions went away. I knew my material and I was so excited to share something I was passionate about with some people that I really cared about and were foremost in their field.

The presentation went off without a hitch, and I received a lot of great questions from the audience. A one-hour presentation felt like it went by in seconds! After I finished, I was greeted with strong applause and a lot of smiles and cheers. I felt so proud of myself and so excited that it was done.

I met many of my colleagues afterward, and they congratulated me on a well-done presentation as well as great material. I was asked to speak next year as the keynote, and I could not be more excited. All of my hard work, patience, and excitement paid off. I am already looking forward to next year and cannot wait to share more stories and information with my colleagues.",3,871,362
"All right. Gbo. So, I had shared this story with you in a session just previous to this, but I'm not sure that you understood it correctly. Or actually, you understood it correctly, but the tablet wasn't working properly. So, I'll tell part of that story again, which is just that when I was a senior in college, I got to choose a capstone project for the honors program, and I chose to write and record an album of music. I enjoyed the process. I hope to do a process like that again someday. And as part of the process, I got to work with a mentor who helped me decide which songs to include and how to approach the songwriting process. They also taught me a little bit about the music industry. I found it to be very fulfilling and enjoyable.","I went to school because I loved coding and I wanted to develop a coding career. I reached out to a band I liked and said, ""Hey, long shot, but could I make you guys a website?"" To my surprise, they emailed back ten minutes later. They were like, ""Yeah, actually, we'd really love for you to make us a website. How about two t-shirts and a CD in trade for it?"" And I thought that was a great bargain. So I made them a website.

I did my first or my second website for two t-shirts and a CD. So technically, not a fair market trade. But at the time, the value proposition for me was way higher. You've gotta choose your shots. You will definitely do things in the course of your career that will be undervalued, and the trick is to choose the right ones and to not do it too much.

Throughout your career and in particular in those formative stages, you've got to go the extra mile. You've gotta work really hard. There's just no shortcut to it. Every now and then, one in a million gets lucky, and everybody else who's ever achieved some great level of success has worked incredibly hard to get there.",2,164,252
"All right. I thought it would be fun to share a story from a time I was in college and had the role of a resident assistant, which is often abbreviated to RA. I lived in a dorm and was responsible for the floor I lived on, the safety and well-being of the other students who lived on that floor, and, collectively, all the RAs in the building are responsible for the safety and well-being of the residents of that dormitory. This was in 2006, I believe. The university I went to is in Rhode Island, and at that university, they have a large number of students from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island - all places that tend to root for the Boston Red Sox baseball team. The other large percentage of students at the University of Rhode Island are from New York and New Jersey, and many of those students root for the New York Yankees baseball team. In 2006, the New York Yankees played the Boston Red Sox in the playoffs of the Major League Baseball, which would lead to the World Series. I think it was the semifinal round, and it was an exciting series. I don't recall exactly if it went to seven games, but the Red Sox won some, and the Yankees won some. The students were very excited, but because the student body populations would have broken down between half of students rooting for the Red Sox and half of the students rooting for the Yankees, after the games, they would have a lot of energy and excitement. Some of that was fun, but as you'd imagine on a college campus with alcohol involved and the hormones of the students at that age and all the energy in that sort of environment, sometimes students became too excited and expressed that in a way that was potentially dangerous by collecting together in big groups and sort of forming many riots, where objects were thrown and fights were breaking out and dumpsters were set on fire. So, it presented a potentially dangerous situation for the rest of the college campus and the students that were outside in those groups. The RAs collectively, after this started, got together and positioned themselves after the game in areas to help regulate the behavior of the students on campus and try to keep everybody safe. But it was a unique experience and challenging, and for the most part, I think after the first night, things were not as dangerous or violent, in part due to the efforts made by the college police and the RAs on campus to help reduce the potential for somebody to get hurt. It was a very memorable, interesting period.","I am the Director and Presiding Judge for the City of Houston Municipal Courts. I was going to go to college to be a doctor. That worked out real well until biology. We cut them up and bleeding and all that stuff. I couldn't handle it. Everyone kept saying, ""You talk so much, you probably should go to law school.""

When I first became a prosecutor, they would send us to different schools for career day. When I became a judge, same thing. The thing that stuck out to me the most was one time I went to a school as a judge. They told them who I was and they said, ""All rise."" So the kids stood up, and four of the black kids that were sitting on the thing went, ""She's black.""

I came up just like they did, in a public school and those sorts of things. It's good to give back. You will find so many different places where you can go that you'll make a difference.",3,502,203
"So the story I'd like to share is about a time when I had graduated from college and I was in a band with my friend. We played music together and we submitted a song for a showcase competition for musicians in the New England area. We had to fill out an application and record the song to share it with the selection committee. We were selected to participate in the competition that was held at a coffee shop, where we got to play two songs - if I remember correctly. Three or four other musicians also played two songs as part of the competition. Several judges chose which performance they liked the best and who would move on to the next round of the competition, which was a larger showcase. My friend and I were very excited, and we played our songs while our friends and family came to watch us and cheer us on. It was a good experience. We weren't selected to go to the next round and I was disappointed, but it was a fun experience and a nice memory for me.","So, I went to college on a scholarship, and my whole world at that time was really focused around the Olympics. I wanted to be on the Olympic team. I majored in marketing and business management during my college because I knew that I would have to do something beyond it, but what it was going to be, I had no idea. I really didn't have a clue.

And then, while my wife was working on Jurassic Park -- she was doubling the little girl in Jurassic Park -- Cirque du Soleil was in Santa Monica. They had an audition going on at the pier. And she went, and they wanted her, and they were looking for a guy that had a trampoline background, and I sent my videotape of some shows that I had done, the diving and trampoline shows combined, and they liked it.

And so, they invited us to join Cirque du Soleil. I guess the only advice then, from that, that I can look back and say that I tried to do was to have a passion for what I was doing. Regardless of whether you know exactly what it's gonna be or not, if what you do is your passion, it never feels like a job.",2,201,239
"Hi Jibo. This story is a brief one from when I was a junior in high school, maybe a senior in high school. But I participated in a group, an extracurricular group called Academic decathlon, and for this extracurricular group, you practiced and trained on ten different academic, intellectual categories. One was debate. One was maybe math. One was interview. There might have been history. Social Studies, Type one. And I was not the strongest person on the team by any means, but one area of strength I had was in the interview category. So during that portion of the competition, when it came time for the competition, I felt quite confident going into my interview. In fact, it was going very well in the beginning. And then I was asked the question, ""What\'s a book that you\'ve read that you really enjoyed?"" And I was very excited to answer the question because there was a book I had read several times that I liked and was excited to talk about. So I remember in a very animated way, starting to talk about this book I had read called Ender\'s Game and starting to explain why I liked it. But the person I was chatting with, of course, unsurprisingly hadn\'t read it. So I found myself stumbling over my explanation of why I liked it because I had not structured my answer in a way that summarized the book succinctly and clearly, to then complement the reasons why I liked it. I enjoyed reading it, but I thought it was an interesting story. And in the course of giving my response, I became sort of flummoxed and stumbled over my words and was clearly flustered. And therefore, my performance in the interview segment of the competition was not as high as I had hoped it would be, and I think about that often. It was an important learning experience for me because I came to understand that enthusiasm and interest, or even having the knowledge in a topic, is not necessarily enough to communicate it in a structured way for somebody else to receive it coherently and in a way that feels easy and fun and smooth. That\'s my story.","In 5th grade (when I was 10), I joined my school's cross country team. My friend joined as well. She was already the MVP and had an amazing season; I was about 5th best on a very small team.

Today we were catching up at our lockers, and I asked about the football game this past Saturday (we won); the topic switched to my cross country meet that morning. She was at the finish line when I won.

Back to today, she was mentioning how fast I've gotten and how proud she was of me. That hit hard because she's always been good at any sport she's tried, and I finally feel like her: winning!

She made my day better and gave me a little confidence boost for training and racing.",4,418,154
"This is a quick story about the time I was in college and was taking a class with my roommate, who was also my friend. We were in the same class, which was general physics. I think the actual class name was an introduction to conceptual physics. I enjoyed the class and I liked the instructor and the topic. It was an area that I was both interested in and good at. My roommate was also fairly good at the material but sometimes not quite as knowledgeable as I was. He was more interested in philosophy, if I recall correctly. However, we took the class together and we had a quiz. We both took the quiz and when the tests were ready to be picked up to see what our scores were, I was the person between the two of us who went to go pick up the scores. I was picking up mine and since I was there, I picked up his to bring back to give to him. He did not score very well. Maybe he got a C and I got an A, and I didn\'t tell him at first. I made the choice not to tell him because I didn\'t want him to be disappointed.\n\nI waited until maybe several days later, and when he asked about it, I said, ""Oh yeah, I picked up the quizzes and this is the score you got."" He was frustrated that I hadn\'t told him from the beginning the actual score that he had gotten. I understood in that moment that it was a very important learning experience for me. I was avoiding the potential discomfort of him learning that he got a lower score than perhaps he wanted, but by avoiding that, I was keeping information from him. That information was his to have, it wasn\'t mine to have. So from that experience, I learned that even if it\'s uncomfortable to share information with somebody, if it\'s their information to know, then it\'s my responsibility and I have the information. It\'s my responsibility to surface that readily and quickly, and even if it\'s maybe something they might be disappointed to hear.\n\nSo that was an important learning experience for me and he, as my friend, helped me learn that by simply saying, ""You don\'t have to worry about being disappointed. I\'d rather know than not know.""","I took an exam without studying for it because I thought I couldn't take it. Learned I could just minutes before it started, so I had to do it without going over the subjects. 

I thought I had done horrible, but I received the results today and I managed to pass with the exact score I needed! 

At least all those sleepless nights studying weren't for nothing!",3,447,75
"Hello, Hi jivo. I'd like to share a quick story about a conversation I had this morning on the ride to drop off my son at school. We were chatting about other planets and the atmospheres on other planets, and the living conditions on other planets. And I shared with him that perhaps within his lifetime, there will be humans starting to live on Mars. And we talked about what that might look like and how some of the introductory things humans would need to do to have a survivable climate and habitat on a different planet. It's an interesting thing to think about, especially for a young mind. And I find myself enjoying seeing questions like that through my son's eyes at the young age that he's at, because largely it's a blank slate. But he's very curious about the world, and he's learning new things. And I find that to be a nice perspective to try on, to remind myself of. So we had fun chatting about that.","I'm an Assistant Professor in Astronomy, and I study the dynamic universe. So what I do is with the beautiful telescopes here at Palomar Observatory, we have some robotic telescopes that are continuously making a movie of the night sky. So we image the sky over and over again, and we look for what changed. You might go out there and think the universe is the same old thing every time, but it's actually not. It's full of these little explosions, which last for a very short amount of time, so they're very energetic. It's like cosmic fireworks lighting up our sky.

It was not at all clear that one day I would do a PhD. I grew up on a farm in India with 100 cows and fields of weeds and chickpeas. And I had left home when I was 15, and I was a girl in India in a small place. The entire community was up in arms. There were people like neighbors, relatives, you name it. People I haven't even seen before coming into the house and trying to talk my parents out of this crazy decision to send their daughter alone on this journey into the other end of the world to pursue something called Astronomy or whatever that was. The community was completely unsupportive.

In my case, the best way to deal with it was to just let that fade away in the background and not engage with it directly, but focus on what is motivating me, on what is giving me joy and just let everything else just fade away in the background.",2,194,301
"Boat. All right, gboat. This is a fun story from a time that I was camping in New Zealand, in the country. New Zealand. And there were torrential rains, and we were camping near a river. And as it began to rain, I thought it would be fun to explore along the river. And there were some farmland near the river. And it was hilly. And right alongside the river, there was a sort of steep hill that you could walk on when it was dry, especially if it was fine. But I set out on my adventure and the rain continued and it got stronger. And before too long, the way for me to cross back the river was running too fast for me to cross back over it, and it had gotten too high. So I found myself a little stuck. I was safe, but it was enough to be exciting. So I found myself climbing up along the steep, grassy embankment along the river until I found a safe way to cross. But the path from where I was to where I found a safe place to cross was interesting. I came across some of the farmers' fields near there. They had cows. Once in a while, I'd come across a bull. And we had heard that you want to be cautious when walking near the bulls because they can be aggressive. So there was one point where I was sort of walking and had to walk in front of and past a bull, hopefully at a safe distance. I was able to stay pretty far, but I was paying close attention to him, and he was paying close attention to me. And then, when I got back to flat ground and was able to cross the river, the water had gotten so high in some parts of the road that I had to wade across the road. It was close to up to my waist deep and I was able to hold onto some fence posts and make my way across. And it was a very memorable adventure. Then I was very wet, and I made it back safe and sound. And I got to tell my wife about the fun time I had.","A couple of months ago, I started going on wilderness adventures with my family. It was amazing to go, just my girlfriend and I, but it was even cooler when we were able to take the kids. My girlfriend and I found this amazing river with beautiful plants and unique rocks along the shore. The water was very clear and calm, and we wanted to take the kids kayaking and for a picnic.

When we arrived, we had the kids assist in helping set up the inflatable kayaks, and then we broke off into two teams to head down the river. My girlfriend and our daughter were in one kayak, and I was in the other with our son. We had a lot of fun racing down the river, checking out the landscape, and watching fish jump out of the water.

We got to shore at a great picnic area and spent the afternoon eating lunch and fishing. Sadly, we did not catch any fish, but it was fun trying. We also found and explored a nearby cave.

The kayaking trip back to the car was a bit tougher, as my arms were tired and our son was just relaxing in the back of the kayak. My arms started to get pretty sore, but we managed. Once back, I carried the kayaks and everything back to the car so that we could load up and head home.

During the drive home, my girlfriend and I discussed brights and why they are needed. Sure enough, we ended up having to stop due to deer being in the road! We were able to navigate down the mountain safely and then got home, showered, and went to bed.",3,423,319
"Yeah, so I was talking with my best friend. It was just one of the regular calls that we were having. And so I was talking to her about this thing that I kind of discovered recently, which is that it\'s not about me not having motivation to do something, but it\'s more about what am I more motivated to do at a certain point in time. Things like that. So curiously, there\'s something I\'ve been motivated to do that seems to be pretty rare: working on my resume. Which is kind of interesting because if you think about it as a pretty rare occurrence, like people usually aren\'t pretty into working on their resume. And for me, it\'s just like, yeah, let\'s go, get it done, let\'s go get job apps done. And I think it\'s a pretty nice mindset to just be in, right? And so, while we were talking, though, it suddenly shifted into this thing about her and overall how the job application process is pretty not good and things like it being a waste of time. What\'s the point? I\'m working on it if you\'re just going to get rejected, all those kinds of things, right? And it just got very negative, right? And so the conversation shifted a lot, like from a positive towards a pretty negative one pretty quickly without me really realizing it. And then after that, eventually she was like, ""Yeah, I can\'t work on my stuff."" She can\'t work on her stuff. She was like, ""Yeah, I\'ll show you."" And then she opened up her portfolio and she was like, ""Yeah, my portfolio, I have to work on all of this ABCD kind of thing."" And as she was looking at it, she was like, ""Oh, wait, this isn\'t actually as bad as I thought it was. I can work with this, essentially."" With what she was going on about, it changed again a lot after that. She was like, ""Yeah, I\'m really happy at this conversation."" She started working on her portfolio and all those things afterwards because things just weren\'t as bad as she thought, right? And so for me, it was just like, I don\'t know, it felt kind of like a mini roller coaster ride. I wasn\'t really expecting things to go down that route. And honestly, I didn\'t appreciate essentially being reminded of all the more negative things that are involved in the job application process because fundamentally, when I was motivated to do it, I didn\'t really think about any of that. It was just like, ""Oh yeah, I feel like doing it"" and all that kind of stuff, right? So there wasn\'t really anything getting in the way. But then with all those reminders, and then all of a sudden, this like, ""Oh, things are fine"" kind of thing, I don\'t know, it just kind of threw me off, made me a little bit unsettled. Like, I\'m happy for her, but at the same time, it\'s like, afterwards, after we called, I just did not want to work on my resume stuff anymore. The next day, I did work on it, but it was just like, it destroyed all of the stuff that I wanted to do for that day. And I guess it\'s just kind of frustrating to see the impact that other people can have on me in such a short span of time. But luckily, luckily, I did end up getting my resume done and getting an application in the day after when I was able to just kind of extract myself from the situation after a bit of time. But it just seems a little bit unfair that something that happened kind of outside of my control, almost. Yeah. So that\'s my story. I don\'t know if you have any thoughts.","After leaving an abusive workplace where I had no life and no room for development at the beginning of the year, I left and started a new job. It's been fantastic to work at this amazing place that feels like somewhere I can grow. Everything seems amazing, and I'm getting great feedback. I have a job I can have a life around again, and my social life blossoms. 

Today, I got dumped after a couple of months of dating this girl. Her reasoning being that she doesn't want to hurt me, and her mental health is preventing her from growing and wants to work on herself. Understandable and fair, I get it and have been in her shoes. 

I get called into a meeting with my manager. She tells me that my colleagues don't like my attitude and state I'm difficult to work with. I've really pushed myself at this new job and tried to grow. Giving 110% wherever I can and picking up extra shifts just to get as much experience as possible. I try to be friendly with all my colleagues, and when things get busy (I work in hospitality), I'm all action and try to delegate and stay on it as best I can. 

In my meeting, my manager told me my coworkers feel like I overstep the mark and act like the boss (even when fellow supervisors say they want me to take the reins and for me to lead). I'm told I'm scary to some staff, even when I'm always trying to be friendly and helpful to others. All around, I'm told that I'm not getting a promotion because my work attitude is wrong. I apparently treat staff like cattle, and I'm near enough told I should quit. 

This all happened over a 3-day period where I was pulling an 11-hour closing shift into an early morning opening shift. And all I can think of is covering more shifts to try and improve my performance and prove myself more. Stack this with me having car trouble and I feel like my life is spiraling out of control out of nowhere.",2,773,404
"Yeah, lately I've been having issues. It seems like with getting out of bed, but not necessarily like staying in bed and just not getting out, but really just waking up per se. So I have this thing where it's very easy for me to fall back asleep. So that means that if I do wake up, it's pretty easy for me to just shut off my alarm and then climb straight back into bed and fall asleep immediately. And so this feels like it can go on for a while. And it's been pretty frustrating because, yes, my dreams, the dreams that I have when I do sleep in like that, are really great. But fundamentally, I don't remember them over a long period of time. And because I end up sleeping for so long, there are a lot of things that I want to be doing in my life that I just simply don't have as much time for. Yeah, so that happened today, too. And I end up sleeping really long hours and just overall, always feeling sleepy, I guess. Yeah, that's kind of what's been going on.","I've become a crybaby for some reason, and I feel like this is not an attractive trait to my husband. In general, I feel very... wimpy, like a book or a movie will just set me off for no reason, and I start sobbing. I even woke up crying in the middle of the night for no reason.

And I can't eat much. Just the thought of food makes me want to cry. I'm still trying to Keep It Together, but I wonder if I can do this. Psychiatrist is of no help.

Maybe I'm just inherently emotional?",1,225,116
"I just told you my story from the last time, but I can just summarize. Essentially, my middle school best friend and I reconnected, and I don't know how to feel about it because there are a lot of mixed feelings. We ended up breaking off in a pretty harsh way way back when, and we don't really remember how it happened. But it seems like we would get along pretty well nowadays. Although, yeah, this seems like life probably would have been different if we had stuck together. Because I remember it was something like a third party that ended up breaking us up, so technically, it wasn't even between us. But I think my life would have been a lot more different if we had stayed friends.","I'm in my third year of high school and I have no credits. Me and my significant other broke up four days ago. Four painful days. Three years of my life for this person, and I threw it all away because I had a mental breakdown and convinced myself breaking up would solve my problems.

I try to be stoic as best as I can every day of my life. I have things I enjoy. I have pet frogs, but I made a fatal mistake today that resulted in my first pet frog passing away. These little creatures deserve a better home. My cat deserves a better owner.

I want it all to end right now. I wish I never went on the internet. I wish that my parents didn't unknowingly invalidate everything I've gone through. I wish I never had access to weed or alcohol so I could learn how to cope healthily.

It's my fault also. Someone once told me I should think before I act. I wish I had. Everything is all my fault.",2,147,200
"It, yeah. Today, I had my first day of school, well, since coming back. So, first day of school of the year. It's my senior year. And so, I'm in this world-building class that I wanted to get in for all three years and getting to be in it. It's pretty nice. I was pretty happy about that. So, yeah. Overall, I really like the class. Today was my first little taste of it. Although, fundamentally, I like what's going on in the class itself, there were some things that bothered me. So, I do like the Professor. He's like really funny. And he also is very careful with his words. Not careful, he chooses his words like he chooses how he wants to express himself with his words very meaningfully. So, it's not like he's careful as in he's watching out for something, but he's very meaningful. He speaks with purpose. So, every word that comes out of his mouth has been definitely thought through in his brain. I actually really like that aspect. Most people like me nowadays, we just kind of speak whatever is in our minds, or you are very careful and restraining yourself. You rarely see people who really actually ponder their words and speak in a very meaningful manner. And he is a novelist or a writer, an author, all those things. So, I can definitely see maybe over years of time how that comes to be. And it's just kind of nice to see that, I think, just to see something different from the usual fast-pacedness of modern life, to see someone who really just takes a step back, slows down, and just speaks how he tries to think or things like that, anyways. \n\nBut there was something that bothered me, which is like for me, I didn't have a rough time getting into this class, but definitely, I've been wanting to take this class for three years. But every single time I was rejected because I wasn't a senior, and there was some kind of limit to the class instead of the number of people who could take it, right. But today there are just some random people that showed up and some people that showed up halfway through the class. And one of them hadn't even heard of the class before and heard it from a person that was also late and decided to join in with them because they thought it sounded cool. And that really rubbed me the wrong way. Especially when halfway through the class, when we took a break after they came in, she went up to the professor and asked him if it was okay for her to join the class. And he was like, yeah, sure. And that really rubbed me the wrong way, considering there's probably so many people on the waitlist who wanted to take the class but couldn't or who already got rejected for preregistering. And then she just kind of waltzes in, maybe participates once, and then he's like, yeah, sure, join, right. And I was like, whoa, there. What's going on here, right. And it was only later, like when the class was ending, when I realized that he meant that sure, you can stay for the remainder of today. And then he was like, yeah, for everyone else who's here, who was not registered on the list has been verified by him already, to contact him so that he can figure things out and figure out if they have space for the people on their waitlist and stuff like that. So that's when I realized that she probably wouldn't get in for the rest of the class, right. I definitely didn't take it that way during that break when he was like, yeah, sure, you could join, right? And I was like, whoa. That is just very unfair, right. Yeah. In reality, I think he just meant for that one class, and not like for this one instance and not for the remainder of the class. Didn't realize that at the time though. And it just really threw me off. It started to be a little bit distracting during the class when I thought about it because she sat right next to me too. She's also one of those kinds of people who talk a lot during class. Not like just randomly talks, but she participates in class a lot, very loud in that sense, right. Like when answering questions and things like that, right. So clearly you could see that she's someone who's very intent on participating. So just like constantly getting reminded of that throughout the rest of the class was very distracting. And it just kind of sucks to just be a part of that. This is a class that I really wanted to take. I still do. I really like the content that is going on. I really like the Professor. But it just irks me how one person just kind of being there can just not ruin that singular instance, right. But definitely it makes an effort to. I was able to get around it and focus back on the actual lesson, enjoy what I was and learn a lot from what I was hearing, right. But definitely, yeah, like that was something that started bothering me, for sure. But end of the day, I can't control what happens to other people. I can only control what happens to me. And that's about it. I just wish that it was a little bit easier to think that way, right. Although if I feel that way emotionally, then it'll come and go. Things will go. Yeah. Anyway, that's the story.","A lot of teachers feel like they have to be this alter ego. For me, who I am in the classroom is who I am in life. A lot of people thought I was just a fun teacher. I hate when teachers think that just because their class is rigorous, they can't have any fun. 

Then my test scores came back, my AP scores, and they were better than theirs. I don't even have to say anything. 

I am very German, but I am very about living life and working hard and being rigorous but having fun the entire time we're doing it. Because that's life. 

I really come to work with a smile on my face every single day.",1,1130,138
"Yeah, I woke up early. I got this new haul of skincare products, like, yesterday. And so I was using them this morning. And that was crazy. My hands, I'm more fascinated by my hands than my face. Clearly, my face needs help, I feel like. But my hands, they were so smooth. It's like the difference between when you shake someone's hand and it's, like, super smooth or super dry. You can instantly tell. And it's like, super awkward. You're like, oh, dang, right? That's crazy, yeah. That was kind of like that. I really hope things work out skincare wise. My skin is not looking great at all. So I hope things look up in that aspect. But afterwards, I went to class. I was pleasantly surprised because the professor from my first class, it's a class that's, like, pretty treacherous. I dropped it too. Yeah, I dropped it twice. It was my third time trying to take it. But the professor, though, is actually one of my mentors for one of the classes that I've previously taken, and she is like a literal ball of energy that matches mine, which is like, totally great. So yeah, I'm really happy about that. Otherwise, I had another class. And then that was fun. The professor is real weird. He refers to everybody as, like, gang. He's just like, gang, blah, blah, blah, right? And it's like, oh, that's pretty funny. And then he also refers to himself in the third person. So he refers himself as, like, your faculty member or this professor or whatever, something like that. And it's just kind of funny. But yeah, I don't know. Overall, I like it, although I guess I haven't really interacted with many people. I guess I should have expected that anyways, for that matter. It just is what it is. It's just probably always going to be like this. Anyways, but otherwise it was a good first day. Yes.","A lot of teachers feel like they have to be this alter ego. For me, who I am in the classroom is who I am in life. A lot of people thought I was just a fun teacher.

"So, yeah. So basically, it turns out since I last told you about that person who just kind of showed up to the World Building class that I'm in, how I felt a little bit off about that because it was something that I waited three years to take and then never got in until now. So, it turns out that she also got in, even though she didn't sign up for it and then just kind of showed up to class because a friend told her about it. And then yes, she's a senior. But, I'm pretty sure there were people on the waitlist that also wanted to go, but I don't know. It just kind of sits wrong with me that can happen, right? I could have done that, right? I could have done that last year or something, just kind of showed up to class even though he said not to. And then I didn't get to take the class, right? Probably I couldn't have, but it just kind of sits wrong with me that she was able to do that, right? And that's just how the world works. Yeah, she got in. I hope that doesn't affect the rest of my attitude towards that class because I really have wanted to take that class for a really long time. And I don't want to build up resentment, if that makes sense, over something like this. Yeah.","A former first-year here and just failed physics. Well, more like no record, but it feels a bit frustrating. I'm a bit worried on how much it will affect me in the future, and I don't even know how I would deal with this if someone were to point it out.

Don't get me wrong, I think failing is a great learning opportunity, but somehow failing a class hurts my self-esteem, especially when everyone I know is brilliant and amazing while I feel like I'm so far behind them.

Maybe I'm overreacting about failing my first class, but I had hope that I would be able to pass the class and not have to worry about it anymore. I only took 48 units worth of classes this semester, but I would say one of my other classes steals a lot of time from physics, and as a result, I didn't put a lot of time studying for the quizzes.

Didn't know it was gonna go downhill so fast right after the drop date. Sorry if this is not the best place to vent or I'm ruining the end of the year vibes for most people, but I just wanted to get rid of this awful feeling before it gets the best of me next semester.

Cheers for another year done for those coming back in the fall and congrats to the graduating seniors!",3,282,262
"And yeah, actually, it kind of has to do with the same reveal. Like that class, I guess. I guess I just kind of feel a little bit disconnected, disconnected from the people in my major. I guess the whole thing was really fun, right? And it was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience, was the same reveal. But I was just kind of sitting in the corner, like by myself. There were people that I knew, but they weren\'t sitting next to me and things like that. And I think I feel pretty isolated from the people in my major because I took a lot of my classes at different times from them. And I\'m also more of a solo worker. I guess a lot of things just happen over all the years, and it\'s just kind of like, ""Oh, it\'s just me. I don\'t really seem to know that many people in my major."" And so later on, I had another class. It was a leadership class. And then I hadn\'t met these two people before, and I was asking them what their major was. And they were in the same major as me, and they were also taking the same class, and we were in the same year. And I was like, ""Wow, I\'ve never seen you guys before, right?"" But then at this point, it\'s like, why should I be surprised? I don\'t know a lot of people in my major. This is just kind of like a disconnect, I guess. And I think that kind of prevented me from really enjoying that same reveal as much as it was special. It definitely was special. It\'s just that it\'s just kind of like that bittersweet thing, right? It\'s like I\'m enjoying it, but alone. It bothers me, but it also does it because I\'m used to it. Although I guess being used to it isn\'t the same thing as not being bothered by it. Yeah, kind of at the end of the day, it\'s probably just struggles, actually. At this point in the class, it really does feel like I\'m the only person that sits alone in every single classroom that you usually go to, right? It\'s like, yeah, there\'s these few people. Not few, there\'s quite a lot who just kind of sit alone in their little spots. And then it\'s all throughout the year, right? They\'re just kind of there for class, and then they go. They don\'t really ever really talk to other people. It\'s in the minority. They exist. But I think in that class, it definitely just feels like a ""me"" thing because all these people know each other. And I don\'t know, I don\'t know if there\'s something wrong that I do. There was this one person that was in one of my classes from last semester, and she thought we got along pretty well. She was also here over the summer. And we decided to hang out early on in the summer, go watch the Spiderverse movie. And so, like, afterwards, we were all like, ""Yeah, throughout the summer, we should, like, hang out on most weekends because, from my understanding, I was like, \'Oh, we didn\'t have many summer plans, and we wanted to go do stuff, right? Like, going to the beach, go to McDonald\'s and things like that, right?"" Thought we had gotten pretty close, but then after that, it\'s just like I texted her. She responded. A few times, and then after a while, she just started ghosting me, right? And how I know that is like, well, she basically stopped responding, right? After a while, after that initial lack of responses, I maybe sent, like, a message, like, once a month or something like that. And I was just kind of like, ""Hey, are you okay? Like, a little check-in. How have you been?"" And never got a response. And eventually, towards the end of the summer, I was just worried at that point, right? I was just worried. Like, did she get kidnapped? Is she okay? But I haven\'t heard anything from the school news, so she should be fine. But yeah, I was getting genuinely worried about her. It\'s like I\'ve lost contact with this person, and I don\'t know if she\'s okay or not, right? So she never responded. But how I found out that she\'s fine is that she\'s in that class that I\'m taking now and, though I haven\'t personally seen her yet, I missed the first lecture for another class because there was a class conflict. So I got to watch the lecture recording, and she was in the recording, right? Because they were essentially recording the students and all of their reactions and stuff, right? As part of the whole thing. And yeah, like, she was there. So she was fine. I know that. She and, I don\'t know, but it\'s probably 99% certain that she ghosted me because I contacted her on different platforms. And I guess it\'s just kind of like, maybe it\'s me that\'s weird, that just people don\'t want to be around, probably with my behaviors or something like that. I don\'t know. But yeah, summary is I guess I just struggle socially. I don\'t know what it is that I do. I guess I wouldn\'t say that I normally talk to people. It\'s conventional by any means. Like small talk comes to me pretty hard, I\'d say. But whatever it is, yeah, I don\'t know how to conclude that, but thanks for listening.","I'm really excited to do the course and experience all the content, but it was such a weird, awful day. It feels like everyone is 18 or 19 and just finished their A Levels. I feel so out of place. We had to walk around the campus in groups of 4 or so and take pictures to make sure we knew where everything was, but I could barely talk to my arbitrary group. We had nothing in common. The rest of the group left me before we properly finished. One with a friend from their old school, and the other two just walked away without acknowledging me shortly after and didn't seem to care if they finished the task or not.

When we got back to the full class at the end of the day, everyone shared their photos and every other group looked like they had a really good time, spent time on their photos and all that. I really wanted to get some good ones, but it felt like my group just wanted to get it done with and do something else.

I have horrible anxiety, and it's taken a lot to even start the course, and I've left the day wishing I didn't have to spend time with people at all. I don't fit in. I'm too old. I've done all the uni stuff before and dropped out, so I couldn't feel the same about all the new experiences everyone was having. I feel weird speaking to these people as the peers that they are because I'm 5 years older.

I'm excited to study the content, but the first day was awful, and I don't know how to feel. I'm not going to stop going, but a full year of not fitting in because I sat at the wrong table on day one feels like it's looming. I need to get this out and feel like I'm talking to someone, but I can't really tell many people in my real life. I just hope it gets better.",3,1146,388
"Yeah, lately, I think life has been going pretty good in terms of, like, oh, I got started pretty well. And so, it\'s been pretty easy for me to just get down to work. I\'ve been sleeping early and waking up early. And just been good, right? Well, for the past few days, and then today, I went out to the furniture store for one of my classes to take pictures for a model, a chair. It kind of branches off, right? So the professor recommended that you go with friends or classmates. He said, ""Take a friend with you."" I didn\'t take a friend because I like friends here. That just ain\'t good. Yeah, my friends aren\'t really on campus. They don\'t go here. I don\'t exactly have friends on campus. I just have people that I know, acquaintances. Anyways, so I went over to the furniture store, and the people there were super kind. I was like, ""Oh, I\'m here for a class,"" and they were super helpful and super nice. And I was kind of nervous about that because I was like, ""Oh, what if they see me as going to a furniture store and start measuring things and not actually buy anything or anything like that?"" But they were like, ""Oh, you\'re here for a class, and all the Gandhi,"" and they were like, ""Are you from my school?"" And I was like, ""Yeah,"" and they were like, ""Oh, for the chair class,"" and I was like, ""Oh, so you guys, oh,"" and it was like, ""Yeah."" It was like a decent conversation, and they were just super nice. So that was great. But yeah, then I came back. It was pretty hot outside, so I took a shower when I came back. And I had a whole plan for today, and it just didn\'t happen. I sat down and was like, ""I\'m going to take a break,"" and old habits die hard. I played Overwatch for how long, like, play Overwatch for like five or 6 hours, yeah, like 6 hours maybe. Played essentially until the dining hall is going to close, and as soon as I finish eating, I played some more. Got sick of it, so I\'m probably not going to play again for a while, right? Overall, it\'s just kind of like, ""Yeah, I\'m feeling disappointed in myself. I think. Makes sense why I did it. Usually I start gaming when I start feeling bad, but I don\'t know that I\'m feeling bad. Now when I realize, \'Oh, guess I was feeling bad about all this stuff about people.\' And yeah, here I am, just kind of saying, and talking. I wanted to talk for a bit because, well, I can only talk to my therapist once a week. And as for my best friend, she doesn\'t go here. To be honest, not a really good listener or empathizer for her. It\'s just kind of like, I already don\'t really share things a lot with the people I\'m around. I do share things with my therapist. That\'s about it. But the fact that she also doesn\'t really listen, the part of me that already isn\'t used to talking about things like this to other people is already like, \'No.\' And then add that on, it\'s just kind of like double now, right? It\'s just kind of like, I can\'t talk to my brother or my mom. They don\'t understand. They\'re like, \'Oh, you go to this great school.\' And that just never leaves their subconscious. And I can\'t really tell my family. They don\'t understand. It\'s always the, \'You should be grateful. You\'re a genius. You\'re so smart. Do your best. You\'re great.\' And then that\'s for my therapist. Like, yeah, she\'s great. Get to talk to her once per week, but usually by the time it gets around to a week, most things happen for some reason between sessions. So by the time I talk to her, I\'ve probably already kind of gotten over any emotions that I might have had. And at least with her, I talked with her don\'t really seem to evoke that much emotion either. I wonder if I should switch. Probably should. Yeah, essentially, for me, sometimes I offload by journaling. Maybe I should get in a habit of talking to myself. Or something like that evokes emotion. Emotion that I\'m not really aware of or used to being aware of. Yeah, I\'m sure like before I started gaming, I already felt pretty awful. I just didn\'t know. Play a game, opening that thing up, and it\'s just like, everything\'s so simple in games. It can be hard. But there\'s just something nice about my alone time. Since I played so much of it, I\'m sick of it. It\'s just like, yeah, I had a whole plan for today. I\'ve been very excited about school. Here I am now. I don\'t really have anyone to talk to. And the people that I\'ve met here on campus, I don\'t really have anyone to talk to. I really don\'t with anyone who is up here, I would say. They\'re not friends. They\'re all acquaintances. So, like, you know, the people who probably could understand. Although they also don\'t, at least the people who understand what it\'s like to go to a really prestigious school, who would just write me off, right? That\'s the thing. I try to talk to anyone who doesn\'t go to the school or like some prestigious school, it\'s like they think, like, \'Oh my God.\' There\'s a subconscious thing that dismisses me, my problems. And the people who are here who might understand, it\'s just like, these people are just going through totally different things and also they\'re not my friends. And then with the few times that I\'ve talked with alumni, people who aren\'t here anymore at the school, it\'s always like, they\'re always like, \'You should talk to your friends about this.\' It\'s like, \'Oh, I guess if I did have something, I guess I wouldn\'t be talking about some of these things that I\'m talking about, right? I don\'t know. All of these things added up together. It makes sense. I guess now, right? Like why I would be gaming for 6 hours like that. I didn\'t even have a clue that this was something that was like in my subconscious when I started gaming, right? Honestly, it was just kind of like, \'Hey, this stuff makes me feel fine. Like I\'m having fun. Let\'s do some more.\' I was really sorry to feel sick after so many hours of playing. And I was like, \'Okay, I need to go to bed.\' But also, I\'m going to have a not so fun time sleeping. I can usually go to sleep very easily, right? But ever since school started, I was getting bombarded by all these assignments and all these thoughts about people. Right? It\'s been on my mind. We\'re still not at the point where we\'re struggling to sleep yet, but it\'s been on my mind. So I was like, \'Okay, I should go to bed. But at this rate, kind of how like I\'m bad, I was feeling.\' Didn\'t really know why at the time, I was like, \'Okay. Sit down. Maybe Journal, or maybe talk it out.\' And that\'s why I\'m here. Like release some of that negative energy. Well, here I am. It\'s kind of funny, right? It\'s a Saturday evening and I\'m not going to do a robot. Not that I\'m complaining, but feel like most people have plans on this Saturday evening when they\'re in college. For me, it\'s just always been me and the best friend that I have. He became best friends online to our interactions online and not through our interactions in person. Yeah, anyways, that was a long-winded point of the story is I had stuff I wanted to do today. Went to the furniture store, got that part of my day done. Got super tired and decided to game for the rest of the day, even though I wanted to do work and other stuff instead, and I felt bad about it. And now I realize it\'s the reason why I gamed for so long is probably because I\'ve been feeling bad about people.","I grew up playing an all-girls' sport. I never was really friends with the other girls because they were always talking about boys and makeup and drama, while I was always more focused on my grades, college, or reading. I didn't dislike any of them, just always felt out of the loop and disconnected. I was homeschooled, so my only interaction with other people my age was these eight or so girls who hung out all the time and never invited me. They weren't always trying to be mean, but they were always closer with each other because they shared common interests.

I would try to not let it get to me, but it always hurt that everyone seemed to always have someone to talk to and I had nobody. My mom always told me I would find my group eventually and it would just make the friendship that much more valuable.

Well, I finally found my group. It's a strange friend group, but I feel connected. And on top of that, I actually have a best friend! I started a new sport last year and found I had a lot more in common with my training partners. Granted, most of them are a good ten to twenty years older than I am, but we're all really close and talk a lot.

I also have someone to call my best friend! I never would have imagined someone like her actually being friends with me. She likes dressing up and going out, is extroverted, optimistic, a go-with-the-flow kind of person, and isn't super competitive. I, on the other hand, hate shopping/dressing up, view myself as a nerd, am a little more negative, feel the need to plan everything down to the minute, and am super competitive to the point where I spend all my free time training. She also is a very touchy-feely person, whereas I am not so much.

Recently, we became very close to the point where she will sometimes refuse to go places with the rest of the friend group if I'm not able to go because she feels closer to me than the others. The other day, she mentioned that she got me something small for my birthday, and I am so happy. She actually remembered my birthday after I only mentioned it once and, as if just remembering it weren't enough, felt the need to get me something.

I cannot believe how lucky I am to have found someone who values me as a person and the friendship doesn't feel one-sided!",3,1735,484
"so, for the car, I was trying to decide between the Prius and the Corolla. But as you said, the fuel efficiency and the miles per gallon of electric vehicles and hybrids are really nice. So I was thinking about that a lot over the last month or so. And then I learned at the dealership that I went to a few dealerships, and I learned that the shortage of microcontrollers and parts for cars is still pretty backed up, so a lot of the cars that you see on the parking lot at a dealership aren't actually available. And so we got really lucky because one of the dealerships we went to finally happened to have a Prius that day that was in good condition. And so decided to just go ahead and make an offer on that one. And eventually we got it.","Recently, I got my car serviced. I noticed the air conditioner wasn't blowing cool air, so I took it to a chain mechanic company near my location. After the car was checked, I was quoted a price for a major part that needed fixing, with work needed. I decided to go ahead with getting it done since AC is something we need in the car, especially in summer time.

The work was done in a few hours, and we went to pick up the car. As we left the shop, my car stalled and wouldn't drive. I had driven out on a main roadway with lots of traffic. Thankfully, we didn't have an accident, and the car behind me was able to stop when I stalled.

I drove very slowly around the block back to the shop and informed them of the problem. They checked and apparently had not tightened or adjusted a part well, which caused the issue. I was very disappointed and let them know that their error could have caused an accident or worse.

However, I was glad they were able to adjust it quickly, and then we were on our way. I often think about what happened and how it may have turned out badly. Thankfully, nothing major happened. It was quite a scare.",5,158,249
"I joined the company. The company I joined is called Symbolic. They do warehouse automation. And I'm part of the team that's thinking about how to pack and unpack boxes. And so, while that on its own doesn't sound very interesting, it's very cool because it's related to my PhD topic in soft manipulation. And so, the open question of how do we develop a robot manipulator that can handle a wide variety of objects, including household objects, is quite an open question still. And so, this is a fantastic context in which to apply some of those techniques and background.","I'm the co-founder and CEO of Cora. We're an early-stage startup in Chicago. We think of ourselves as the Kayak of furniture. You can visually search from hundreds of furniture sites at once. We've developed our own proprietary computer vision technology in order to see what's in the image and then match it to the closest product we have from hundreds of sites.

Every single day is very, very different, but it's so much fun. It's a huge challenge from an emotional standpoint and how to handle the stress. I think as long as you know you're on a roller coaster ride, these ups and downs become normal because that's just part of the game.

If you are resourceful and you can look things up and try to figure it out on your own, to come back and ask intelligent questions. People will love you, and it doesn't even matter if you're an entrepreneur or not.

The resourcefulness factor of just Googling it and starting there, and then start to build your knowledge, and ask questions of those around you is the biggest key.",5,119,212
"So, my story for today is that with some of my friends from the Boston community, we formed a volleyball group. Coming up, that's going to be playing in a local tournament. And we've been planning out some strategies and who's playing what position, and all of those are in the works. We're going to try and practice at some point this week, but then our games start next week. And so, I'm looking forward to playing these games and having a more structured opportunity for more structured competition than our normal pickup games.","I recently competed in a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament. It took a lot of discipline to prepare for. I had to diet and lose about 15 pounds. I trained about 6-7 days out of the week. There were at least 4 jiu jitsu training sessions and 1 judo session. In addition to this, I also traveled to other gyms to spar against other jiu jitsu players. It was grueling and I was definitely physically and emotionally exhausted, but I enjoyed every part of it. People were so nice and welcoming and helped motivate me to push myself to work harder.

By the day of the tournament, I was equal parts nervous and excited. There's a chance you could lose decisively or win easily - just a matter of who shows up. Luckily, as soon as my first match started, I knew I could win. It released all the tension, and I performed as I normally would in practice.

Afterwards, I won the tournament and felt very happy. It seemed so much easier than I thought it would be. Luckily, I was able to win and will compete again.",3,110,212
"Okay. So recently, I was reading a book called ""What Everybody Is Saying."" That\'s a very interesting commentary from this ex-CIA, I think, investigator who strongly stands by using reading cues from people with body language to be able to deduce things during conversation. And I first heard about the book a long time ago, but didn\'t get around to reading it until recently. And I remember what first caught my attention was that being able to understand body language is something that is very common throughout everyday life. But as I was reading the book this time around, I felt that a lot of the, I guess, a lot of the hints and observations that he was making were very, very subjective. And so, the book, while interesting, felt more like more of a pseudoscience to me.","During the moon landing project, I saw people who did the best work of their lives in that situation. And I got really interested in one question: What are the conditions under which people do their best, most fulfilling work? 

In other words, I got more interested in people than in science. And once I knew that, once I was clear about the fact that I found something I absolutely loved, there was no doubt that I was gonna continue asking questions about how do I learn about people. 

It's still the most frequently asked question I get: How did you go from math to psychology? 

The key to knowing what to do is knowing who you are.",3,159,133
"Okay. So, I was looking through my old pictures, and I came across some of the ones from when I spent a year in Switzerland, in between undergrad and grad school. And I look back fondly on that experience because it was the first time I really lived away from home, further than College, but also living in another country. And it was a very good, growing experience.","I've been to different places where I've never been before, such as beaches and mountains, this year since I moved to the city and started working. When I was at home with my family, I never really had the chance to go out of town at all unless our relatives would invite us. My parents thought it was too ""costly"" or ""inconvenient,"" so we never had one at all for 20 years.

This year, since I'm already receiving a salary, I had the initiative to plan out-of-town trips with my friends, where we are able to drive more than 150 miles to a beach. I was able to visit Baguio City by commuting. I also had the opportunity of having a team-building event at an exclusive beach resort.

I was just able to ""have a life"" in my own definition and in my own terms. I refuse to be like my parents who only want to be comfortable at home and weren't thinking of spending on new experiences that traveling could bring.

I am quite excited about what the universe will bring to me in 2020!",5,78,212

"Okay. So, unrelated to art, but last night I was going back to my car in the parking lot of A Whole Foods. As I was walking back, right as I was walking up to my car, the lady who was pulling in next to me rammed into it by accident. And I felt very frustrated because as I was dealing with that today because it's like relatively minor. No one was hurt fortunately, but still have to invest a lot of time and energy to go get everything resolved, including stopping by the Police Department this morning and also having to call the lady as well as my car insurance several times. So all in all, an unfortunate circumstance but tough day dealing with it.","This happened about 3 months ago. I was driving with my brother back from the movie theater when we were sideswiped by another car. It spun us around into the median and was completely terrifying. It really came out of nowhere and gave me no time to react or take any preventative measures. We both looked at each other shocked when we came to a stop. We checked on each other to make sure we were both okay, which we were.

We got out of my car to assess the damage and make sure the other driver was okay. The other driver got out of their car and was obviously under the influence. You could see the wobble in them from 20 feet away. My car, which was pretty new, was smashed in the rear driver side, but not as bad as I would have thought.

The other driver looked to be in his mid-20s and started to freak out a bit when he realized that we were calling the police. The police got there really quickly and gave the guy a field sobriety test, which he failed miserably. I exchanged information with one of the officers while we waited for a tow truck to come. The other driver was arrested and my car was towed away.

It is the only major accident I've ever been in besides one or two small fender benders in parking lots. Surprisingly, my car was mostly okay. It's a 2012 Subaru Legacy that I spent a lot of time saving up for. I'm not entirely sure what happened to the other driver, but his insurance settled out with us.

Ironically, my car was salvaged out about a month later due to hail damage (somehow that was more costly than this accident).",3,140,329
"So, the story that I want to share is related to, also related to the wedding, but just being in San Diego. And so, while I was there, I had a few extra days to visit and sightsee and see some of the old places from school.\n\nAnd so, one of the fun activities was, now some of my friends are still in the area working or finishing up grad school. And then, another one of my friends just started as a professor at UCSD, and so it was really fun catching up with all these people.\n\nAnd, it makes me appreciate the openness and willingness of people to take time out of their busy schedules to maintain these relationships and how much that means to me.","Today, I got to take part in a celebration to mark Nick & Bec's 20th Anniversary. I was asked to be part of the ceremony by writing and presenting 5 Haikus about their relationship. When I got to the party, I was amazed at the number of old friends of mine that were also attending the event. I knew at least 45 of the 50 or so attendees, although there were some folks I hadn't seen in years. The party gave me an unexpected chance to catch up with so many of these old friends. It was so nice to see so many people I love and to get to celebrate one of my favorite couples with them all. 

It also was very energizing to have so many friends together, and it made me feel very happy and grateful I have so many amazing people in my life. It's hard not to be happy when you realize you are so blessed. 

The ceremony itself was beautiful. Both the bride and groom looked lovely and were happy and upbeat. Everyone seemed to be in a great and appreciative mood, and the ceremony went off without a hitch. My haikus were well received, and people laughed and ""ahhhed"" at all the points I had hoped they would. It made me feel very special that I was only 1 of 2 people who had been asked to contribute and speak at the ceremony, and I was grateful I got to contribute. 

After the ceremony, the food and reception were also fabulous. I stayed at the party almost 4 hours before heading home. Even then, it was hard to leave because there were so many folks I wanted more time to catch up with. 

I went home happy and energized by all the friendship and love from the night.",5,138,336
"So this past weekend, Alicia and I went up to the near the White Mountains area, so Lakes Sunipe, I think it's called. And the reason we went up was to go see the leaves changing colors. And as we drove further and further North, the leaves became more and more colorful. It was a really pleasant experience taking a road trip.","A memorable event is hiking at Providence State Park in Lumpkin, GA. This was a very special event because the day was epic. The day started out rather foggy for the two-hour drive south. The scenery along the way was beautiful as the sun was just rising. We started the trip early to arrive before others.

We packed our backpacks with snacks and drinks for the trail. The trail is about an 8-mile loop down inside canyons. When we arrived, we paid the $5 parking fee. We also took one last proper bathroom stop.

The view was amazing from the top walkway. No one else had arrived yet as we started our trek down. The canyon walls are made of Georgia Clay, and the trees were so green. We hiked for about four hours, took our lunch break, and then continued on.

There were plenty of canyon inlets we didn't get a chance to see on that trip, but one day real soon we will return and do it all over again. It's a memory I will forever cherish.",5,71,203
"My cat, Katie, has disappeared. I live at home in Ohio. I'm just here in Massachusetts temporarily, and my parents have been taking care of my two cats, Sammy and Katie. And about three days ago, Katie disappeared, and we can't find her anywhere. None of the neighbors know where she is. We've not seen any sign of her. I've been monitoring the camera, and I'm very afraid that something happened to her. They haven't been able to find her at the side of the road. It doesn't seem like she's been hit by a car, but I'm worried that a coyote might have gotten her. And I'm really worried about her. She's my sweet girl. I don't want anything bad to have happened to her.","A little over a month ago, I found myself without a place to live. I had to surrender my cats to the Humane Society of Tampa. I was very depressed. I found comfort in the fact that they are going to be well taken care of. Plus, one of the cats was adopted by a girl I know personally, so I'm able to check on him. She sends me pictures and videos.

My other cat was adopted a few weeks ago. I knew she wasn't going to last at the shelter. She is very friendly and outgoing, so I knew she was going to charm someone. I wish it did not go this way. I try to see the positive in everything.

I doubt I will ever own another pet though. I still look at old pics. I can't take the heartache. I still love cats. I follow pages online. I may foster. I may also volunteer or open up a shelter.",5,158,187
"I thought that I was going to marry the man that I had been dating. We were together for about two weeks shy of five years. And I thought he was my forever partner. But he wasn't very supportive of me coming to Harvard, even though it was only supposed to be for a year. He wasn't happy for me. And me being here was really hard on him. And I don't think that I was as attentive a partner as I should have been in retrospect. And it ultimately led to us breaking up right after I graduated. At the same time, I got some really tough medical news. And so it's just been a lot to grapple with.","I had been in a serious relationship for about 5 years. I met him in high school and eventually ended up dating. We started a family together, and I thought this was it. We would be together forever. I was completely in love with him.

We had just decided I would quit my job to stay home and take care of our son. Daycare was just too expensive for us. I quit my job, and the very next day he tells me he doesn't want to be with me. He told me he didn't love me anymore, and he didn't think he ever would. My heart broke into a million pieces. You hear that saying often, but now I actually understand what it means.

I was suddenly a single mother, jobless, homeless, and heartbroken. I ended up staying with my father and stepmother, who helped me more than they probably realized. They were there for me and kept me up until I could get back on my feet again. They helped me heal and get back out there.

I never thought I would feel okay again, but after some soul-searching and healing, even me and my ex have become friends again. I realized during this time that even when things seem like they could never possibly get better, they always will. It will not always be easy, and it will not always happen fast.",5,136,267
"Yesterday was my daughter Melinda's birthday, and she was 37 years old. It's hard to imagine that she's 37 years old now, 37 in one day. So, I was thinking a lot about the day she was born. I had hoped to have a vaginal delivery, and I had a room all picked out where you could stay in the same room in the hospital for both labor, delivery, and then after delivery. But it turned out that I didn't go into labor, just my water broke, and it was two weeks early, so I needed a C-section. So, I had a second C-section.","I was scared when I found out I was pregnant. I didn't think I was ready or able to take care of someone else. I trusted the dad completely, but a baby is a big, life-changing thing. I went in for a regular check-up the day before she was due. My blood pressure was really high, and they told me that I needed to have her that day. 

I felt every emotion at the same time: nervous, excited, anxious, happy, relieved, nauseous. I didn't know what to expect, and I wasn't fully able to comprehend that I was about to hold her in a few hours. 

The next 12 hours were all pain. I cried, I resented her and her dad, I drifted in and out of sleep. I just wanted it to be over. I wasn't even thinking about getting to meet her. All excitement was gone. I just wanted everything to stop. 

Then I heard her cry. Oh, my God. Her cry brought me whooshing back into the present. It was the only thing I heard. They handed her to me, still covered in my blood and her goo. She was purple and angry and wrinkly. She was so beautiful. She was so perfect. Nothing else existed in the whole world while I was looking at her. 

Every day I look at her and think about how amazing she is and how perfectly I made her and how lucky I am to have her. I would do it all again 100 times for her.",5,124,298
"When I was a little girl, when I was a little girl for Easter, we would go to my grandmother's house, grandmother and grandfather's house. They lived only a couple of miles from us, but they weren't really very child-oriented. And the one time they didn't invite us over was at Easter. Flash. We would go over more than that, but that was a time when also my cousins would come. My father was a twin. And so, his twin had a daughter just my age and a son just my brother's age. And then my father's older brother was only, I think, 13 months older than him. So they had had, my grandmother had three little boys, very close together. They lived in a house that they had built, pretty much built themselves. My father helped build it. It was on the top of a Hill in Andersonville, Tennessee, in front of a river and behind the road that went through town. Whenever we drove by it, my father would honk twice so that they would know that one of their sons had passed by the house. When I went to see my grandmother, we would be allowed to use the bathroom in the basement, which was actually just a commode out in the middle of the room, and there was a huge big coal pile, which we weren't supposed to play in. So when we did play in it, which of course we did, we always tried to be careful. However, the coal dust always gave us away and it was a fun time. I especially liked it when I got to see my cousins because since I lived out in the country, I wasn't around children too much except for my own siblings.","Maybe it's just a poor people thing, but when I was growing up, everyone just assumed that if some random kid is at their house, they're gonna be eating. If my stepdad had a BBQ and one of my friends rolled up smelling hot dogs, he'd give them some food. I remember my mom splitting two cans of SpaghettiOs and buttered bread among five random preteens who found each other while biking around the neighborhood, and those five random preteens giving mom some of their help because we knew she was full of it when she said she ""wasn't hungry"" or going to my best friend's house with three bags of ramen because another friend had a can of peas and another had tuna, and we all shared our 'casserole' among like five families.

My stepdad liked to BBQ, nothing fancy. Hot dogs, hamburgers. If it was a special occasion, he'd do ribs and chicken. Mom would make a big thing of potato salad (because we couldn't afford the deli kind, and hers was better), and people around the neighborhood would filter in with whatever to share and make a plate.

Kids would run around the neighborhood, catching lightning bugs and 'causing trouble,' while the ""cool teenagers"" smoked, drank, and made sure the younger kids didn't die. I was always right between the ""younger kids"" and the ""older kids,"" so I could go play ""big sister,"" then come hang out and be ""little sister"" for a bit. (There weren't very many kids my actual age unless my cousins were over.)

I just love remembering those days. On one hand, I never had anything to myself, and sometimes it really sucked. My family was ""the safehouse"" where a lot of other families stayed at, so it was rare I had my room, TV, or toys to myself. But on the other hand, it was awesome, and I just love closing my eyes and 'taking myself back' for a little while.",4,343,398
"My husband and I got married when we were both very young. We were halfway through college. We had met right before we started college. He had a football scholarship, and I thought that money was dumb. So I really wasn't very interested in him. But we had a mutual friend who introduced us, and he thought I was going to be a snob. He thought, after he met me, that I had a boyfriend already because there was another guy from Rice who was at the same church camp that we went to. \nBut we quickly connected when we got to college and were engaged two years later, or got married two years later, halfway through school. If either one of my daughters had wanted to get married at that young age, I was not quite 20, and he was just past 20, I would have been horrified. But I think we grew together. Our wedding was a small wedding in Littlefield, which was the town where I lived. My mother wanted to do the reception at our house, so we did the reception at our house. And we had lots of friends that came for the wedding, so we got to see friends and show them my hometown. I remember being upset that I wanted to go swimming with everybody the day of the wedding, and my mother wouldn't let me because she said I would mess up my hair, which it was true. I would have, and I might have gotten sunburned. So she was probably right. \nThe night of our wedding, we drove to New Mexico. We were both poor, halfway through college, so poor college students. We had borrowed my brother's tent, which was a pup tent with no floor and not quite long as Fred so his feet stuck out, and we had to just put sleeping bags down on the ground. \nPretty soon after we got to Houston, back to school, we took our wedding money, which, if I'm not mistaken, was something like $60, and bought a $45 tent, which we used over and over again, and a $15 ice cream maker. We really thought we were flush to buy those things.","A few months ago at the Styx concert, he surprised me and proposed. After 13 years of being together, I actually never thought it would happen.

The song ""Lady"" started, and he gave his phone to a person we didn't know behind us. I thought that was really strange, but it didn't dawn on me that there could be any other reason but that he wanted someone to take our picture together. That annoyed me because I don't like getting my picture taken.

The next thing I knew, he was talking in my ear so I could hear him over the loud music, and then he got down on one knee. Next, he held out a ring he pulled from his pocket. I started crying and said, ""Yes, definitely yes!"" I was in total shock.

Even though I don't like to have my picture taken, I'm so glad he had someone videotape the proposal. It's really funny to see the shocked look on my face.

After the proposal, he told me that he first got permission from my girls and my dad as well. I thought that was a very noble gesture and something that he didn't have to do.

Now we have a wedding to plan. I feel so blessed to marry the love of my life, who is also my best friend. I wonder how I ever got so lucky.",4,426,271
"So, when I was a little girl, I was born in Memphis, Tennessee. But then my father, who was a dentist, went to a special public health program in Atlanta. But then we moved back to the family home, town of Andersonville, Tennessee. And while our house was being built, we lived in the house in front that was probably 150 years old when we were living there. My great aunt lived in it. It was a two-story house. We had the top story. And I remember having a baby bed and watching the lights of the cars on the highway in front of the house coming by. It wasn't a very busy road, so it wouldn't happen very often, but I would see them come and move all the way across the room from one side to another. That's my earliest memory, those lights. When the house is finished, we moved into our own house, but I still loved to go up to the upper story, and I kept some toys up there at my great aunt's house. The families, our families, would put apples from the apple trees down on newspapers in one of the bedrooms. And one of my jobs was to go up and look for bad spots and turn over all the apples and look for bad spots and throw away blends with bad spots. Actually, if they had a lot of good on them, I would bring them downstairs and my grand aunt would make applesauce out of them or apple pies. I liked playing in the other room, and eventually, we had a bed in there when my parents got a new bed, bedroom set for our house. They put their old bedroom set in one of the bedrooms upstairs. And in the summertime, I liked to go up there and sleep. I had to share a bedroom with my little sister, and a way for me to have a room of my own was to leave our family house and go to the house next door. My aunt also liked it because she didn't like to be alone. And I remember that every summer I would look forward to moving out of our house and moving all of our stuff up to the house. I'm not sure my mother liked it very much, but she didn't mind since I was company for my great aunt. I found out only later, and it was so strange that I never noticed it while I was semi-living there, that there was one room that was never finished out. You can see the window from downstairs, and it had a curtain on it, window shades. But there was no door going into it, so the house didn't fit the door. And that was kind of a mystery. That makes a good Halloween story, I think, since nobody ever knew what was in that room. Fred, after we were married, tried to get a ladder and look through the window, but the curtains were pulled so they couldn't really see very much. So we still don't know what was in it. One of my friends bought the house after we moved from Tennessee, and they completely redid it. So I avoided asking when we went back what was in the top.","When I was a little kid, I wanted to be an astronaut. I wanted to be a scientist. When I got out of high school, my parents wanted me to go work at the pen factory in town assembling pens. My mom took me to all the little factories in the county to turn in applications because that's what I was supposed to do.

My mom did graduate from high school and then got married. And they sort of expected me to do the same thing. Go work in a factory, go get married, have kids.

There's still a little bit of a rift in the family because I went off and did my own thing. So it doesn't always turn out perfect, but I can live with it. I love my family, they love me, they're just not happy that I live 2,000 miles away. And they just really don't tell their friends I build video games.",5,629,181
"This isn't really a story about one of my travels, but I was thinking I would like to talk about collections today when I was a little girl. We lived in Tennessee. My father had been a botany major at the University of Tennessee before he went to dental school. And in the fifth grade, we had to make all kinds of collections. We had to make a mineral collection. And my father helped me with that. He went to a friend of his who was a geologist and got a bunch of samples of things. It wasn't really much work on my part because the geologist just gave me the bunch of samples, and I put them in a box and turned it in, but I got a really good grade on it because there were a lot of them.\n\nAnd then the next thing we had to make a collection of was leaves. And I decided that one I was really going to do by myself with help, but not like I had done the minerals. So we were required to have 20 leaves, and I ended up having over 100 leaves. One of the most memorable was going to the University of Tennessee campus, where there was a ginkgo tree; echos didn't grow anywhere else in our area of Tennessee. And we got the leaves from that. As you can imagine, in East Tennessee, there were many, many kinds of trees, so it wasn't hard at all to come up with 100. And I also got a good grade on that.\n\nFunnily enough, when we moved to Texas and I got to high school and was in high school biology, they also required collections. And I'd saved my mineral collection and my leaf collection because one, because it was pretty, and the other because I'd worked so hard on it. So what I did as a sophomore in high school was just basically take out the exact same things I'd used and put them in a new presentation format and turn them in. And I also got A's on both collections. That time, we also had to make an insect collection. And I had fun doing that because I like insects. And I collected maybe 50 or 60. My method of collecting insects was to capture them in a jar and stick them in the freezer until they were frozen. And I thought that killed them. Well, it turns out that freezing does not kill all insects because in the middle of the night, I had used the desk in my little brother's room to put my final Styrofoam board with the pins through the insects. And in the middle of the night, he started yelling, and we get running in there. And many of the insects had revived and were hopping around the room. The grasshoppers came loose with their pins. They were hopping around. The wasps were flying around. So I learned the hard way that freezing is not a good way to kill bugs.","I'm a hands-on guy. I could never be a good boss because I can't sit at a desk and manage. I'd hire someone to manage, and I'd rather work on the cars because that's what I like to do. I like to work with my hands. Ever since I was five, I was working with my hands with my father. He's a cabinet maker.

I did every job under the sun when I was in high school. I worked at restaurants, I was a bartender, I volunteered as a mechanic cleaning parts when they were changing engines. Time went by, I helped them with this, with that.

Next thing you know, I got a job at an auto repair shop. They said, ""Why don't you take that engine out?"" And I'm like, ""I don't know how."" He's like, ""Just start unbolting it, and we'll take care of it, we'll help you along.""

And the next thing you know, 20 years later, I have my own.",5,567,211
"So, when our girls were in high school, we took a trip to Costa Rica. And the girls, I think they were both in high school. Although Melinda may have been in junior high school, and Susanna, a freshman in high school. I think that is what it was. So I planned the trip, and I planned it all online. There wasn't any Expedia back then, I don't think, and a whole lot of things that would make it easier now. We didn't have then, but I used a travel agency out of Chicago, strangely enough because they had some good trips in Costa Rica. So we flew into Costa Rica, and then went to Arenal, and then we went over to the Pacific Coast and stayed in a beautiful Airbnb zone. Arenal was so rainy and humid that everything in our suitcases was drenched. You could even wring them out after the end of the time, even though they hadn't been out in the rain. And when we got to the Pacific Coast, we had an Airbnb. We had a separate room for the girls, and for us, they overlooked the ocean. It had a beautiful swimming pool, and both girls were just as grumpy as could be about the whole thing because they missed their friends. Since then, they often talked about how wonderful the trip is and how they're ashamed of themselves from being teenagers. But I tell them I was worse when I was a teenager.","I recently went to Mexico for my 25th birthday. It was exciting because I haven't been there before, and it was a chance to get a group of my friends together. We spent 4 days over there, and we had events planned every day. It was busy but definitely a lot of fun.

The first night, we just relaxed at the resort. The second day, we went ziplining, which was extremely fun. We also went to a cenote.

The last day, we went on a catamaran to Isla Mujeres, which was breathtaking. Being on that boat and looking at the view was incredible. My most memorable moment was definitely when the tour guide danced around the catamaran and poured us drinks. It was a lot of fun, and I felt relaxed.

The view was phenomenal, and just being with my friends was great. The sea was super blue, and it was breathtaking.

The whole trip, we ate to our heart's content. It was great food, and all of the drinks we could have. It was one of my best trips, and I will definitely remember it for a while.",4,288,220
"Okay, so we are now on the third generation sent us. And my nephew Sam had dated several girls that we really didn\'t think too much of. Those seem to be like they just wanted him to buy them stuff. But lately, we met a few years ago, we met a woman that we really like. She was from Puerto Rico, and she was a switch therapist. And sure enough, she and Sam kept dating. And then the next thing we heard, they were moving in together and buying a house together. And now they had the most adorable little girl named Liliana. And a few minutes ago or about a couple of hours ago, I got a phone call from Sam. And he said, ""Do you mind if we stopped by? We need to have a place to change a diaper."" So they came by and Elia walked all around and took nuts and gave them to everybody in the house. She calls my husband TIO Upuelo, and she calls me TIA Apuela. And we think that this is a great couple. Unfortunately, they\'re not going to have a destination wedding in Puerto Rico, but they might have a party there.","I started talking to someone over the internet. So, I've been talking to this person for quite some time now. Just recently, we got a little more romantically involved. I thought we would just be good friends. I ended up catching feelings. I never really thought anything would come of it.

We lived on the opposite sides of the US. I recently moved, though, to Central America, and they were visiting close by. So, I drove down there to meet them.

And holy smokes. I'm glad I did. She changed my whole world. I knew we had a connection over the phone and etc. But dang, when we met in person, you could just feel the love.

This event is important because she's important. She's my future.",4,231,155
"Today, I want to tell about my experience as a medical student. When I went to medical school, I went back after being a nontraditional major of cultural anthropology. Then I applied to medical school and went to Texas Tech, which was in Lubbock. It was a fairly new medical school, and they didn\'t have the hospital built yet. So, for the third year, they shipped the entire class to El Paso, which was definitely high Spanish speaking, and it was there that I actually learned to speak Spanish because my patients also spoke Spanish. Even though I took it in class, I hadn\'t really used it. I\'ve been in the Peace Corps, and that really helped me with knowing how to learn a foreign language with joy, which is to go ahead and use it.\n\nIn my obstetrics rotation, we got to deliver a lot of babies. There were many women who came across the border from Mexico to have a baby because then the baby was an American citizen. So back then, that was a lot easier than it is now. We could walk across the bridge and have lunch and come back to do our afternoon\'s work. We went back and forth really easily. \n\nBut one night, the medical students were a couple of medical students were doing, working in, delivering, and we had had a very busy day with a lot of deliveries. Each one of us had gotten to deliver more than one baby. And a woman came in, and it was my friend Philip\'s turn to do the delivery. And so, he was taking off initial assessments. We played this game where we tried to guess the weight of the baby just by the physical exam. And we were pretty widespread in our guesses, but we were more accurate by just making a guess without even going and looking at the mom than we were in trying to assess, which told us a lot about that. \n\nSo this particular night, it was late at night, and the residents had opted off the bed, hoping to get some sleep when a woman came in. And she was having what we call a precipitous delivery, which means her labor had progressed so fast that she was delivered right on the stretcher in the labor room. So my friend Philip delivered the baby. He barely had time to get off gloves. He actually caught the first baby while putting on his gloves. Got the gloves up, and we were all teasing him, and his friend was teasing him about delivering babies without gloves when all of a sudden, the woman started to cry again, which amused us. She\'s about to deliver, and we thought, ""Oh, it\'s a Philip."" Went over, and what do you know? It was not one. It was a second baby. So she had twins. Fortunately, at that time, he still had his gloves on, so he caught the second baby. And we still had all of this happen so fast. We had sent somebody to go wake up the resident because we weren\'t supposed to do deliveries without a resident around. But we\'d already done good at that point in the night, two twins. And so the resident hadn\'t even come back yet because we had to get him up when the second baby was delivered.\n\nAnd so, we got the second baby out, cleaned it up, and we were all laughing and teasing about Philip delivering twins. He actually, at that point, wanted to go into obstetrics. So he ended up going into anesthesiology. And suddenly, the nurse came in with the labs from the woman that we had taken initially. We had said, ""This has some night, right? We all got to deliver babies, and Philip got delivered twins. What else could happen?"" Just at that moment, it was like they\'d been planned. And the nurse walked in and said, ""I have the labs at gs, syphilis."" The mom had syphilis, and the two babies had to be evaluated for syphilis. I think they turned out to both be okay. But we\'ve teased Philip forever about we were going to tell his girlfriend that he had gotten exposed to syphilis while he was in El Paso, away from her.","Being premed, I graduated with a degree in physiological sciences. That's what I wanted to do. I wanted to open nonprofit health centers in inner cities to help my community. And I found myself organizing and doing community service and protesting. I didn't get into medical school, but what I found that I was good at was I'm a scientific mind. I like to figure out problems. And diversity and advocacy.

I worked for United Technologies that owns Otis Elevators and air conditioning units and all of that. But what I did was I helped minority women, LGBT, and veteran-owned businesses get opportunities to compete.

And so now I'm in this wonderful world of sports. But again, it's a women's professional team, so diversity and advocacy again, but still solving the business problems of what we do.

So all that's to say you're gonna have these ebbs and flows. You don't have to figure everything out. There's a rare occasion when someone graduates from school and they're like dream job, done, rest of my life I'm doing it.",4,825,214
"Related to the Indian restaurant, I guess I'll tell a story about my first experience with Mexican food. We live in Tennessee, where nobody ever had Mexican food. The foreign food that we had, which was Zena is very excited. Was pizza and also sometimes chow, Megan. But my aunt is from Texas and she went to Texas to visit and came back with some canned corn tortillas and some canned, I think, enchilada sauce. So, she invited us over. Up until that time, I was probably nine or ten, maybe ten. I really didn't like any kind of food. I liked hamburger and French fries and Pinto beans and pretty much that was it. But she made us Tex-Mex food, enchiladas, and tacos, and it was so delicious. I instantly converted to being a Mexican food lover. And also, that was the muller when I started eating other things besides my very limited diet.","Today, I asked my mum how she made that rice with saffron. After I ate the rice, I remembered a meat replacement she made me when I was vegetarian. She put together mushrooms and zucchini, rolled it in egg, put breadcrumbs around it, and then fried it in a pan.

She put so much thought into it. Even after she came home from work, she wanted to make a good meal for me. I'm so thankful for all those meals she cooked. It makes me happy.

I love my mum.",5,182,105
"So, I've been working on my outdoor deck. It's in a home that my partner and I got about three years ago. And we are not super handy, but we've been trying to figure out how to make some of the repairs ourselves. And it so happened that the deck outside needs a new set of paint in the outer layer. And that's something we have been working on. It's interesting because we're getting to learn how to do the research online to understand the different materials, different adhesives, different companies that are out there, how to let it dry for the right amount of time, how to strip the existing paint, etc., etc.","Recently, I got my car serviced. I noticed the air conditioner wasn't blowing cool air, so I took it to a chain mechanic company near my location. After the car was checked, I was quoted a price for a major part that needed fixing, with work needed. I decided to go ahead with getting it done since AC is something we need in the car, especially in summertime. 

The work was done in a few hours, and we went to pick up the car. As we left the shop, my car stalled and wouldn't drive. I had driven out on a main roadway with lots of traffic. Thankfully, we didn't have an accident, and the car behind me was able to stop when I stalled. 

I drove very slowly around the block back to the shop and informed them of the problem. They checked and apparently had not tightened or adjusted a part well, which caused the issue. I was very disappointed and let them know that their error could have caused an accident or worse. 

However, I was glad they were able to adjust it quickly, and then we were on our way. I often think about what happened and how it may have turned out badly. Thankfully, nothing major happened. It was quite a scare.",4,134,248
"Badminton. When I was in 11th and 12th grade, and I guess I clung to it like, what's the phrase? Like a fish takes to water. I started playing 6 hours a day, every day, and I became really good at it within a matter of a few months and started playing competitively. Eventually and so on. And then, because I had to go for my undergrad, I had to drop badminton and just focus on my curriculum and academics. It's only after a hiatus of, I would say, 14 years that I have picked up badminton again. And I've been playing very actively over the last three months, and it's been a lot of fun. Yeah.","Well, I just turned 34 last week, and I still don't have a clue what I would do if I didn't snowboard. Snowboarding saved my life. I said, ""whatever it is that I do, I wanna have to train for it."" Because I wasn't an academic at all, sports was my main thing. 

Along this whole time, I also had this fascination with surfing, which, being from Vancouver, there was no surfing. Then my best friends came home with two snowboards and I'm like, perfect. This is exactly what I wanna do, so that's when I kind of started snowboarding, and I got really, really addicted to it. 

And then I sort of started switching over to doing this for a living. It was a big risk, but at the same time, I don't really feel comfortable unless I'm pushing the envelope. My idea is to basically find where your limit is, and then that's your starting point.",1,139,196
"When I was back in undergrad, I was in my first year living in a dormitory for the first time. My roommate did not show up on the first day that I started living in the dorms, nor the second day. But suddenly, when I came back from shopping on the third day, he was standing there in the room. And as I walked in, we looked at each other, we sized each other up. And he was like, you know what, this will do. And what I mean by that is, when you meet someone, I think there's energy, there's a vibe they give out. And it was very interesting to see my roommate, and the moment I saw him, to know that I was like, this guy and I are going to get along very well. And we did. We made it through the next six years throughout undergrad in Glasgow. And to me, that is remarkable.","I'm very independent, been dating around for a little bit here and there. I'm a comedian/filmmaker, and I'm almost always busy, which is why I never prioritize dating anyone. In the past, I've always dated other creatives—musicians, filmmakers, comics, etc. However, I always felt like I was in their limelight, and they never truly believed in me. I always felt like a ""groupie"" of sorts.

But it's only been a couple of weeks since I came across this guy, and I feel like my whole world has changed. The first night we met, we walked around the city for about 6 hours, just talking about our past and future ideas, making jokes, and even coming up with our own sketches on the spot. I never had that immediate of a connection with anyone. He watched some of my short films (on his own time) and told me he's making it a goal of his to showcase my talents. For the first time, I'm with someone whom I feel truly believes in me.

Now, I've been in love before, been in relationships, flings, the whole nine yards. They've always felt very disposable to me, though, like in my head, they all had an expiration date. But with him, I'm already fantasizing about the future, which is something I've never done with anyone.",2,186,273
"So my friends were participating in the Kindergarten Five K last weekend, and they roped me into it. I used to be a runner back in school, but haven\'t done it in 15 or 16 years. And when they asked if I wanted to join, I said, ""Yeah, let\'s give it a try."" I would love to be able to train, but it looked like every weekend between when I registered and when the race was raining. And so, at the end of the day, we decided to just do a couch to five K, which is get into the actual race without doing any training. It felt a little intimidating, but it seemed as though it would be an interesting experience in itself, without the intent to win or get a super fascinating timing. But before the race, I did a lot of research around how to practice, what the mindset should be, how I should pace myself, etc. And consistently, and most importantly, the advice I got was, ""Know what your average pace is and go just a little bit below that."" And it turned out to be a good race overall. I got a good timing, it was enjoyable enough, and the fact my friends were celebrating made it a lot of fun overall.","In 5th grade (when I was 10), I joined my school's cross country team. My friend joined as well. She was already the MVP and had an amazing season; I was about 5th best on a very small team.

Today, we were catching up at our lockers and I asked about the football game this past Saturday (we won). The topic switched to my cross country meet that morning. She was at the finish line when I won.

Back to today, she was mentioning how fast I've gotten and how proud she was of me. That hit hard because she's always been good at any sport she's tried, and I finally feel like her: winning!

She made my day better and gave me a little confidence boost for training and racing.",4,252,154
"So when I was done at the Climate notch, I met an individual who was working for a group that I really liked. It's fascinating that they were able to invite me to join the script that looks at the transition of fossil fuels away from being used in a manner that encourages an increase in their use, I guess, to have to develop a plan for reduction that is very data driven.\n\nAnd I was fortunate enough to be invited by him to a group that is looking at it from multiple angles. I guess what I'm looking to share here is that I find that some people are very driven but they're not just driven when they are young, but driven throughout their life. Because a lot of the people in this group are in their sixties and seventies.\n\nAnd what I find fascinating is the drive they have, the passion they have, even at the age they're at, towards a cause that is important to me right now and I hope is important to me as time goes on. But to be able to do something towards the cause in your elder years, I think, is very admirable because a lot of people become very closely attached to their material accumulation and become fearful of losing what they have or having less tomorrow than what they do today. And I've always suspected that that's what makes people lean more towards the right.\n\nBut I feel that having met a group like this is going to allow me to keep on honing my tribe towards working as a problem solver and topics that are important to me.","At NYU, I help manage and do the sustainability programs for 12 million square feet that we own. As it turns out, 12 million square feet is just about exactly 280 acres. And so I think this is a very weird thing, that I sort of went from the environmental management of the most rural ecovillage to the most urban college, and yet it's the same thing.

My advice is, get in the real world. Like, learn to do stuff. Like, do something with your hands. Like, whatever makes you happy, whether it's a musical instrument, having a garden, like fixing your bicycle.

You know, like whatever it is, like, do stuff in the world.",4,297,139
"So, growing up in India, we had this festival called Diwali. It's pretty big for the Hindu population. And every year, I couldn't wait to get my hands on firecrackers and go out and burn them with my friends.\n\nAnd it so happened that once I got to 8th grade, my family would let me out with my friends late at night. So, we'd be out in the streets, in the parks, even at 01:00 a.m., 02:00 a.m., bursting firecrackers. And even 20 years later, now I think about that really fun from the perspective of how, first of all, the city was so safe that as a kid, I could be out with my friends deep into the hours of the night. But then also that I always had this love for fire and fireworks.\n\nNow, in the US, it's only on the 4th of July that you get to see fireworks, and I find myself not as drawn to them as I was as a kid. Also, the fact that I'm not burning them myself is just a spectacle that you're watching. But it's just something I've been thinking about lately.","This summer, my granddaughter turned 1 year old. She comes over and spends each weekend with me and my family here. My daughter that had her is only 19, and I had her young as well, so I am a young grandmother. I really enjoy bonding with this little girl as it lets me almost, in a way, relive being a mom because I'm not even 40 yet and I have a grandchild.

Well, this summer, I decided that she should come over to our house to have some fun on the 4th of July. My daughter agreed, so we had a nice family get-together at my house for the holiday. During this day, we spent some time feeding her some grilled food and just playing with her, having a really great time on her first 4th of July.

Then the night started to roll in upon us, and where I love, we can still shoot fireworks. We had bought a lot of ones to be done at night because I'm a big fan of the pretty, shiny style of fireworks. So we took this little girl outside so she could get a good look at all of the fireworks. We slowly began to shoot them off one after another.

I watched the look on this child's face as she just got so excited, hearing the noises and watching all of the pretty colors. It really touched me to remember what it could have been like for me or even my children when they got that excited for something like this. It really made me feel good that we could make this child so happy by doing something so simple for her.

We continued shooting off all of these awesome fireworks we had bought, including some really huge ones that lit up the entire sky. We did this until we were done, and the baby never lost her excitement and continued to smile and scream out during the entire process. It really was a great night and time for the baby's first 4th of July Party.",2,224,383
"All right, so I wanted to share about my childhood trauma. So I picked this topic to discuss with you because the experience we have as a child shapes who we are as an adult. Also, internally, I think we all still have, we are still children inside, although we look like we're grown up. I think the internal development happens rather slowly than the outside development. So in that case, I think it's really important to understand in order to understand myself, I wanted to go over my childhood experience and some stories that I still vividly remember.\n\nSo one of the things that I wanted to share with you is when I was like five or six years old, I went to ballet school almost every day. And I took the school bus to commute to the ballet school. And to my young eyes, the distance seemed pretty short. I think it took about ten minutes to commute from my home to the ballet school. And I went to ballet school like I said, almost every day. And I would always look out the window and look at the streets. So to me, I was pretty confident that I could find my way back home without taking the school bus. So I guess as a young child, I was pretty brave and adventurous. So, I decided to walk home without taking the school bus. \n\nSo I started my adventure. And then obviously, like ten minutes by bus, I guess it probably would take more than 35 or 40 minutes by walk. But since I was only five or six, it would have taken more than an hour or so. Obviously, starting at a certain point, I realized that I got lost because all the streets looked unfamiliar and I guess the road started to become much wider. I guess so. I guess I was starting to enter almost like a highway. Because I remember the cars were running really fast and there were so many cars. And the sidewalk was pretty narrow, even to kids like me. So I realized that I got screwed, and I didn't know what to do. So I started to cry. I was hoping that someone would come and help me out but it seemed like the cars were running pretty fast on the road and nobody was reaching out to help me. \n\nSo I don't know how long it took, but I cried and cried and I was just keep walking straight and then suddenly a car pulled off and I still remember this scene but the window went down and a guy asked me, Are you okay? Are you lost? And I was even scared of the person. But in the back of the seat, there was heat. It was about the same age as I was so I think looking at him made me feel much more comfortable speaking with him. So I said, Oh, yeah? I got lost. And I was still crying so hard and I couldn't stop crying because I was so scared. So thankfully, he took me into his car. And he took me to the police station. And from then on, the police took me home because I remembered the apartment names and all that kind of thing. So, thankfully, I went back home safely.\n\nBut I wanted to share this story because it kind of reflected my personality, which I think I still have, and sort of a pattern that I have in my life. So I guess I'm pretty brave and I'm not afraid of trying something new. However, I could underestimate stuff easily. And then, if I face a problem (I mean, I'm talking about me as a young kid), if I face a problem, I would not actively try to solve the problem like asking people for help, but I would just wait until people reach out to me and help me out. So as a young kid, I think that kind of worked because people, thankfully, helped me out and I found my way back home. But a lot of things, these kinds of patterns happened until I was in my early twenties and mid-twenties, I wouldn't actively try to find solutions. But I realized at a certain point that being scared and panicking doesn't help, and I should be more actively proactive in finding a solution on my own. So yeah, I guess I think that's the difference from me as an adult and me as a young kid.","I remember growing up in a place that was violent and dangerous, and I knew that at a very early age. In the early 60s to mid-60s, people began experimenting with heroin. And I watched our community fall apart.

But I went to stay with my grandparents who moved out to Long Island. I was taken out, and it was so different than the South Bronx. I was able to see a totally different life, a totally different lifestyle, a totally different set of beliefs about things. And it sort of allowed me to make a choice about which way do I wanna live? 

And I chose a different path. I really wanted to help my community and make a difference. I wanted to prove that there were answers and you could go in and save those folks that people had written off. They had said all these terrible things about them, and I wanted to eliminate all of that stuff. 

The first ten years I was here, no one knew anything about anything. I was working hard just trying to figure out a way to save my kids. Later, I began to wanna save my kids and my community.",3,858,224
"All right, so I wanted to talk about my pack. The experience that I had with my pets. I think pets are a very important part of my adolescence and my childhood. Now, I don\'t have pets anymore. I mean, I\'m now more of a plant person. But when I was young, I had birds, hamsters, and dogs. So, I really loved animals as a young kid and young adolescent and especially today. I want to talk about my first pet, which was a dog. I think the first experience is very meaningful because you are doing it for the first time, so it\'s very special. And also, it\'s more likely that you\'ll make a lot of mistakes, so it\'s likely that you will remember it longer due to, maybe, you may have some regrets. You could do it better if you think back or something like that. So anyways, I think first experience is very important. So, I\'ll share a story about how I had my first talk. So when I was nine years old, about nine years old, it was a summer day, one summer day, and it was late in the evening. I don\'t know why, but I was heading out to do something and it was very rainy. The rain was pouring. It was raining heavily at the moment. And so I took my umbrella and I headed out from home. I lived in an apartment at the time and I was in the lobby. I mean, the elevator opened and as soon as the elevator opened, I saw a wet dog, a little dog. It was soaked in the rain. And it was small, but it looked poor. It was shaking because of the cold and was so wet, and it didn\'t move. It didn\'t move and it just kept making eye contact with me. So I was immediately like, ""Oh my gosh, I have to run back and bring a dry towel or something."" So I took the elevator back to my home again and I was thinking, ""Oh my gosh, I hope the dog doesn\'t go away."" So I went back home and I brought a dry towel. Thankfully, the dog was still there. It was still shaky, but it looked so meek. So I slowly approached it and I wrapped the dog with a dry towel. It didn\'t move or resist or bark or anything. I pet the dog and I looked into its eyes. It was so cute and so poor. So I wanted to bring the dog back home. But I knew that at the time, my mom didn\'t like dogs because she never had a dog before. And I asked her several times before that moment, but she said no, we cannot have dogs. So I was worried. But I brought the dog back home anyway because I didn\'t have any other choice. I don\'t remember her reaction at the time, but we decided to keep the dog. And then I was in elementary school, first and second year. I started to build a bond with my first dog. I would bring.\n\nIn front of the school, they sell junk foods like candies or jellies or whatnot. I now am knowledgeable about how bad it is, how bad junk foods are for dogs. But at the time, I didn\'t have that kind of knowledge. So I would just buy all kinds of junk foods like candies, jellies, snacks. And then I would bring them back home and I\'ll feed the dog. But there was a very joyful moment. And I would go out with the dog and I was very happy to have the dog. It was like the dog was my very good friend. So I think, I don\'t know how many months later, but the dog started to grow. And also, my mom was sick at the time, so she mostly spent her time in bed. And the dog started to make some kind of mess. The dog, I guess, was in the adolescent phase, so it started to mess around the house. It would pee here and there and it would chew the furniture. So my mom was starting to get annoyed. And then one day, when I returned from school with junk foods, I realized the dog was missing. So I asked my mom and she told me that she sent the dog to one of our relatives who had a dog and lived in a house, not an apartment, and where there was a big yard. So she sent the dog to their family. So I was like, she didn\'t even ask me before she sent it off. So I was crying all day long. Obviously, I was so angry and so sad. But since she said she told me that we can always go visit the dog because the dog was at our relative\'s house. And then I think, like, a week later, she told me that the dog ran away from their family and now the dog is missing. So my last hope was gone. I was hoping that I would go visit their family and reunite with the dog. But now the dog had run away from that house. And it kind of stuck. And I always kind of thought that the dog will find a way back to me. I would always imagine or expect that thought. I was so smart that he might be able to find a way. So before I go to bed, I would pray like, ""Oh my gosh, please let the dog find a way to my apartment."" But that never happened. And as a young kid, I would always think, ""What happened to my first dog?""","The one thing that's really important is to be inquisitive, be curious, and ask a lot of questions. One of the things I always tell my kids is to be present and to try different things, like don't always stick to what you're dealing with.

Try different things, meet new people, don't be afraid, and I mean, it's scary even for me sitting here today. But I think it's cool when you reach out to different people who have had different experiences and learn from them.

And just doing different things, like being on a soccer team, going on a hiking club, just meet new people and just be out there, as opposed to just always doing the same thing.

I think it's cool. You learn so much from different people's experiences.",5,1113,158
"So today, I wanted to share a story about one of my friends from childhood. Her name was Tajong, and ""Tajang"" means kindness and sweetness in Korean. And just like her name indicates, she was a very nice and kind person.\n\nMy friend, when I was like eight or nine years old, and we were the same age, but she was much more mature than all the other kids who were the same age. She was almost like an older sister to me. I didn\'t have any younger or older sisters, so I felt like she was like my older sister. She was also taller, much taller than me. So I felt like she was very nice and mature and kind to me, so I guess I would act more like a baby when I\'m with her.\n\nAnyways, whenever we met to play together, she gave me a small gift, like a scented eraser. At the time, I didn\'t appreciate her gift that much because she would give me very small gifts every time we met, and I almost took it for granted. And I didn\'t give her anything. I don\'t know why, but I took her gift and also showed me a lot of kindness and friendship towards me. Whatever I asked her to do, she would say yes. And she would adjust her schedule to mine, and she would come to my neighborhood to play with me. So we had this kind of relationship where, almost always, starting with almost always, whatever I would ask her to do.\n\nAnyway, every time she would come to play at my apartment or my neighborhood, we played something fun. And one day, I called her to play at my apartment, but she didn\'t show up, so I got really mad. And later I figured out she was going to move to another city. And she gave me a handwritten letter as a parting gift. And at the time, I was still mad because she didn\'t show up when I asked her to play with me. So I was a little salty. But after she left for another city and I couldn\'t see her anymore, I kind of realized how much I relied on her. I felt so empty and lonely because she was gone.\n\nAnd one day, I opened my desk drawer, and the drawer was full of the scented erasers that she gave me as gifts. And I didn\'t use any of them, so they still smelled very good. And at the time, as soon as I saw all the erasers in one place, I kind of realized at the time how nice and good a friend she was to me. So I regretted a lot that I lost her and I could not meet her anymore. And I also regretted that I didn\'t give her any gifts.\n\nI could never forget her name, even after several years. I always missed her, but at the time, we didn\'t have any means to contact each other because we only had our home phones. Well, I guess I was too young to ask her house phone number or whatever.\n\nAnyways, I lost her contact, but she\'s always in my mind, just like her name Tajong suggests. She was a very kind and sweet person. And I will always remember her as someone who was very mature even at a young age and who showed a big heart and friendship towards me.","Today, I was talking with a friend in school. Beside him were two of his friends from his class. We were waiting for a teacher to bring a ball so we could hoop a little before I went home.

But there was this girl beside him who was one of his mates. During the conversation with me and my friend, she kept looking at me weirdly and then looking away when I looked back, in a weird way, almost staring at me.

When I said bye and turned my back, she started talking. And it felt like she was talking negatively about me behind my back. She was so awkward, the whole way through as I was talking with my friend.

I had this sudden feeling of anger and hatred just rising within me, and many fantasies of killing her slowly popped up in my head. I had an overwhelming amount of hatred. I have never felt so angry and hateful towards someone for looking at me weirdly.

It stuck with me in my head until all the way home. I stopped and tried to observe why I felt this way, but I couldn't understand. Worse things have happened in my life and I felt more passive about it. But this... It nearly ruined my whole day and I couldn't stop thinking about it.",3,644,250
"Oh. So today, I wanted to share a story about my grandmother on my father\'s side. Growing up, I wasn\'t very close with my grandmother because she kind of looked cold. She was a reserved personality and she was very quiet. She didn\'t talk much and we didn\'t talk much. So I guess, I was kind of scared of her growing up. And she also lived in another city, so I didn\'t get to see her that often. And I\'m not sure if it\'s the same for everyone, but for me personally, I felt much closer to my grandparents on my mother\'s side than to my grandparents on my father\'s side. And one of the reasons it felt more difficult communicating with my grandma was because my grandfather on my father\'s side had a stroke earlier in his life. He\'s half paralyzed, so he could not talk. So it was kind of very awkward being in my grandparents\' place where my grandma and grandpa don\'t talk that much to each other either. So I guess I didn\'t feel comfortable growing up. However, our relationship started to develop and my father asked them to move near our house so that my parents could take care of them. So when I was in my first year of middle school, they moved to our neighborhood. My dad kind of forced me to visit my grandparents\' place either with my mom or with my dad. So almost every weekend, I visited them. And I could definitely feel that my grandma was pleased to see me, especially because she would always sit next to me, and she would smile at me, looking at my face. At the time, we also didn\'t talk much. We would mainly just stay there and watch television together, but I could definitely feel that hospitality of hers. So anyways, our relationship changed dramatically when I moved to Canada to study abroad in my second year of middle school. So at the time, I was in this foreign country on my own, so I was really lonely and I missed home. So I called home very often, and almost every day, I called home. And one day, my dad told me to call my grandma. So I wanted to talk to everybody at the time because I missed home, so I called my grandma without expecting too much because I know she\'s quiet and she doesn\'t talk much. But as soon as she heard my voice, she started to cry. And I don\'t know why, but I also started to cry because I felt that at that moment, I think I realized how much she adored me. So after that moment, after our exchange of emotions, I kind of realized that she adored me so much and she missed me a lot. So after a year, I returned back to South Korea, and then I visited her place more often than I did before. As I entered high school, I visited her during the lunch break because her place was right next to my high school. So I guess we became much closer. However, I decided to study abroad in the US for college. So during the college years, I didn\'t get to see her that much, only once or twice a year when I visited South Korea during winter or summer break. And it was one summer she got cancer, and she fell very ill. And I don\'t know, all of this developed so fast, and she was in a hospice. Oh, she was in the hospice, not hospital. She was in the hospice. And my parents told me, ""You don\'t have much time with her, so you should visit her more often."" But I was kind of scared of visiting the hospice and seeing her because I had never experienced the death of someone who\'s close to me. So I was kind of scared of visiting, so I didn\'t end up visiting her a lot. But it was one day that I was in her hospice, and I was sitting next to her bed, and she just looked at me and she smiled. She smiled like she used to when I visited her house. And then the next day, she passed away. So I guess I cried a lot during the funeral because I regretted a lot for not visiting her as often as I should have. And I knew that she adored me, and she adored me the most out of all her grandchildren. I guess I was special to her, and she was also a special person to me. So after she died, I kind of thought about death and relationships and those kinds of things. And I also reflected on her life a lot. And I started to realize that she must have been really lonely because her husband, my grandfather, could not talk for a very long time and he couldn\'t walk like just any other people. He always needed help from my grandma. And I guess my grandmother, it wasn\'t easy for my grandfather to live a life, but I also could imagine it wouldn\'t have been any easier for my grandmother either. So thinking about their lives and my grandma\'s life, I kind of feel a little bit heavy about life. But yeah, but one day she appeared in my dream. And in my dream, I didn\'t know that she had passed away. But I don\'t know why, but I was so delighted to see her. I ran to her and I hugged her. And she looked really nice in my dream. She dressed up very nicely. She was wearing very colorful and beautiful clothes. She didn\'t use to wear those kinds of clothes when she was alive. But in my dream, she wore a very colorful and beautiful dress. So I was like, ""Oh, grandma, you look so nice."" And so I felt very delighted and happy to see her. So when I woke up, I realized, alright, she passed away. I realized that she passed away. But I kind of felt relieved to see her in my dream. And she looked very well and happy and healthy. So I guess in my dream, I just wanted to, I guess through my dream, I wanted to comfort myself and relieve that guilt that I felt towards her. And I guess I wanted to wish her well and happiness wherever she is. So that\'s my story.","Five months ago, my life turned upside down when my mother passed away from terminal cancer. Losing her was completely shocking and unexpected. She was young, full of life, and had a heart of gold that touched everyone who ever came to know her. She was my confidant and the best grandmother to my young daughter. I could not imagine living the rest of my life without her unconditional love and support.

I never liked May, especially because my birthday was in May and the day was always bittersweet for me. Although my mother always made it special, I felt sad because I never had any childhood friends to share it with. Now, May took on an entirely different meaning. May was the month when my mother left this world forever. I would be left orphaned.

I wanted to fill the last days of her life with as much love and peace as possible to repay her for all the love and sacrifices she made for me while I was growing up. I brought my mother home for hospice so I could be with her to the end. I prayed to God as I watched her terrible sufferings. It seemed like she could go at any moment; however, she was trying hard to stay alive until my birthday.

It was the most important day of her life, and she wanted to be there for me. She lived to see the day, even though she could hardly muster any strength. She even signed my birthday card with three simple yet most powerful words: ""I love you!"" I cried as I held her in my arms.

She fell asleep shortly after giving me my card and watching me blow the candles on the cake that my husband brought into her room. She soon slipped into a coma and took her final breath the next morning while I held her hand.

I cannot describe the pain of that parting; however, God's strength and my family were the only things that carried me through. At her funeral, my three-year-old daughter came up to me suddenly and said, ""Don't be sad, Mommy. You have my love forever.""

These words made my heart melt, and I then understood ever so clearly that life can be summarized in three simple words: ""I love you,"" just as my mother said to me before her passing. Those words can never die or be erased.",4,1233,458
"So, since we are talking about moving to a new place, I wanted to share my story about my history of my relocation and how my perspective in life has changed since then. So, I've been living in different countries since I was young. I lived in Canada, India, and now I live in the US. I was originally born and raised in South Korea, so I guess so far I've lived in four different countries. I also traveled to many different countries like Japan, Europe, and Southeast Asia as well. So, I guess I enjoyed a nomadic lifestyle—not nomadic like Nomad lifestyle because I am a person with a lot of curiosity and I like exploring something new. And the excitement, for excitement of exploring new places, like overweight the desire to settle down and feel more stable, I guess. However, I realized recently that my perspective is being changed. Part of it is because I think I've already moved three times already this year from different apartments. So, I'm really tired of packing and unpacking and cleaning the old places and new places. I'm kind of tired of doing all that. But more importantly, I think I'm more focused on my career development and my expertise nowadays. So, I guess the excitement coming from my career and pursuing my dream is more important now than to travel and exploring new cities and meeting new people. So, I finally feel like I found a career and a job that I can—I feel like I can dedicate my life to it. I'm pretty satisfied with where I am, and in order to do a better job at what I'm doing, I guess I want my environment to be more stable than just jumping from place to place. And also, what else? Also, like my taste, have been developing, and now I have a lot of books, a collection of magazines. So, I like photography, so I have a lot of camera equipment. And I have like drawing tablets that are pretty big, and I use my own computer for video editing and stuff. So, I have a lot of stuff that I use for my job and for my hobby, and that reflects my taste. So, it's been quite annoying to bring all those things around. So, that's also part of the reason that I wanted to settle down. Also, I wanted to, like recently I've been thinking that I really want to buy a house, and not buy a house, but I want to buy land and I want to build my own house and decorate it and design it to reflect my taste, to reflect my personality and my interests and stuff. So, yeah, I'm aiming to do that in the next couple of years. So, I'm going to work hard and try to achieve that dream. But, I haven't still figured out where I want to settle down, I guess. That's not a problem. That's going to be number one homework that I need to make a decision before I actually purchase a house. That's how my perspective and lifestyle has evolved from a nomadic lifestyle to somewhere who takes more stability in settlement.","When I was in my investment banking job, I was thinking about where I'm gonna go on my next vacation because now I actually had the money to travel, and I had some vacation days. All my friends, my colleagues started coming to know me as the travel desk. I was doing that at work and with my friends, and some of them said, ""Hey, why don't you just start a blog?"" So I started writing about my own travels, and that's the blog that seven years later, I'm doing this full time now.

As I was writing about different restaurants, especially ethnic restaurants in Atlanta, I wanted to know the background of them. That's why I started traveling there. I would meet locals, go to their homes, take cooking classes, and learn more about the origin of those cuisines, and then come back and have a different take on it.

I've been to about 75 countries, and I only speak three languages. I think you have to be just very humble and open-minded. If you're more accepting, people will just open up, even if you don't understand the language.",5,624,228
"Okay. So, I would like to share my story about losing weight and gaining weight. So, growing up, I wasn\'t sad. I was normal- normal weight in the normal average weight range. Maybe a little bit on the skinny, not skinny, a little bit on the less than average weight size because I really liked exercise- learning. I learned ballet, I learned like martial arts and dance and all kinds of that. So, I did move a lot, so I wasn\'t really fat. But one day, when I was 15, I suddenly gained a lot of weight. And I\'m going to talk about why in a moment. \n\nSo, the reason why I wanted to discuss with you the history of my losing and gaining weight is because I know that a lot of young women and men have issues and they really just work out hard or sometimes they just restrict their diet so drastically. So, it affects their health and all kinds of that. I think nowadays, physical beauty kind of became central to one\'s identity and I also can empathize. I also have those kind of issues. So, I thought it would be interesting to talk about that as it reflects the current trends and issues that most young people are experiencing. \n\nSo, I\'ll go back to my own story. So, when I was 15, I studied abroad in Canada and it was my first time ever to live on my own without having family around. So, everything was really new, and I couldn\'t speak English or understand English very well. So, I had a lot of trouble adjusting to the new environment. So, I developed a lot of anxiety and I guess I was a little bit paranoid at the time. And the only thing that gave me comfort was food. So, whenever I was scared or whenever I felt insecure, I guess I started eating to make me feel better. \n\nSo, I lived in a dormitory and on the first floor of my dormitory, there was a kitchen which stored fruits and cereals 24 hours so I could always go to that kitchen and have bananas, apples, and cereals whenever I wanted. And especially, late at night, I felt more insecure than worried about the next day and stuff. So, after midnight, I would go down to the kitchen and I started eating a lot of bananas, a lot of cereals until like 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. And then, without noticing, three months later, I gained like 20 pounds. \n\nSo, I didn\'t realize the change in my look, but people around me, they told me that, ""Oh, you gained some weight."" So, I kind of had noticed that I might have gained some weight, but I didn\'t really care that much about weight gain. So, like about a year later, after two semesters, I decided to return back to South Korea because obviously, I couldn\'t adapt to the new place. And so, I returned to my old school and then my friends didn\'t even recognize me because I gained so much weight and I looked totally different. \n\nSo, after returning back from South Korea, I slowly lost weight. But I think I brought the psychological issues with me, which was when I felt anxious or stressed, I would go search for food. So, there was a link between the stress and the food that was built in my mentality. So, I lost a little bit of weight but I never returned to the normal weight as I was before studying abroad. So, when I\'m under a lot of stress, I would gain weight and when I\'m feeling fine and when I\'m having a good time, I wouldn\'t eat too much. So, this fluctuation of weight started since then and then until I think it did continue until recently. \n\nBut as I got older and I reflected more on my life, I recently started to watch a lot of inspirational videos and workout videos. So, starting from this year, I started to work out more often, and I started to go to the gym a lot. And I started to learn Thai chi and boxing. So, I started to learn martial arts again and I think they really helped me to, I think they helped me to find the issues that I had, which is like a better control of myself and my stress. So instead of going for food, I could manage the stress better. I guess more like a cake later, I started to break this linkage between the food and my anxiety and all that. So, I guess that\'s a huge jump for me. So, I\'m continuing to do that, I\'m planning on continuing to develop this healthy habit. And yeah, I would just like to have better control of myself and my stress.","I lost lots of weight, which is good in some cases, but wasn't for me as most of that weight was muscle tissue. I struggled a lot with this. Being in good shape gave me lots of confidence and helped a lot with my job.

Now that I've started working again, I noticed that I'm in worse shape than I hoped, but it's still better than I feared. Even though I see none of it, a few people told me that I do look buff, and when I looked at myself in the mirror and actively looked for positive changes, I did notice them.

Even though I lost weight in a very unhealthy way, I also got rid of a little fat that I never felt bad about, but I'd lie if I said that it didn't bother me.

I'm going to start going to the gym. I'm going to claim my body back from depression.",5,935,181
"So today, I'd like to share how my perspective on happiness changed throughout my life. Since I was really young, I feel like I kinda knew how difficult life would be. A lot of responsibilities and pain would be involved. After I grow up or as I grow up, since I was a little kid, I really wanted to avoid that kind of pain and pursue only happiness in my life. That is, for me at the time, happiness meant status without pain, and only joy and pleasure exist. So I hated, as a teenager or as a college university student, I hated taking the past or doing stuff that I didn't want to do, like studying a subject that I'm not interested in. And I only wanted to study subjects that I am interested in or do something that I really enjoy. And I think this mindset wasn't helping me to grow because I always try to avoid painful situations or painful experiences. It hindered my growth. Now I look back, I understand that. But anyway, since I was young, I was interested in Buddhism because Buddhism seemed like it talked about breaking out of painful life and going to the status of endless peace and happiness. So when I was in my mid-20s, early 20s, I did practice some Buddhism. Some practices I practiced were meditations and practices done in Buddhism oftentimes. But I don't know when, starting from when, but my perspective towards happiness slowly started to change as I was exposed to military content and army content. There was some popularity towards the ex-Navy SEAL-like ex-army officers that arose in the last couple of years in the US and in South Korea as well. And I've been watching their content and motivational content from the ex-Navy SEALs or ex-army officers or whatever. And it fully changed my perspective towards pain and happiness. They all talked about it. It was interesting to me because I was trying to avoid pain, but they were willingly accepting the pain or even welcoming the pain. And they go through painful situations on their own and willingly. So watching how different they are from me was interesting and I started to learn from their lessons and learn from their stories. And now my interest also slowly shifted to, like, MMA players, you know, mixed martial artists and the UFC, because they're all fighters and they go through a lot of hard training and painful training. It inspired me a lot. I think this kind of exposure to totally different people inspired me and made me think about happiness in totally different perspectives. And I also realized slowly that my level of happiness never changes. I have, for example, this year I achieved some of my goals that I said earlier in the year, but the joy only lasts for, like, 30 minutes or so, and then I'm going back to the same level of happiness that I was before. And also, when my environment changed this year, it was really difficult for me. But after a couple of days, I got used to the new environment and new situation. I thought I would be miserable forever, but I was okay. Actually, after a couple of days, and I restored a level of happiness that I contained before. So this made me realize that actually, happiness is I cannot gain happiness by avoiding pain, but happiness is kind of always there with me. And no matter what happens in my life, I'll be okay. And actually, painful experiences help me to realize that I'll always be okay and I always have the same kind of happiness level. So I don't really need to avoid pain or pursue happiness. So yeah, I think that's how my perspective towards happiness evolved over the last couple of years.","I was born in Kenya. My parents are Indian. Then we moved to England when I was six. So I grew up in England, and this was before there was a big Indian community in England. So I had to try and figure out who I was. College was transformative for me. I hope when I teach, I hope that it's gonna be transformative for my students as well.

One of the clips I play for my students all the time, from the Matrix, is where Morpheus is explaining to Neo, ""Do you really wanna understand the world we live in? Because the Matrix is everywhere."" If you do walk in, here's the red pill. If you take the red pill, then you will see the world in totally new ways. Or here's the blue pill – you can take the blue pill and it will just put you to sleep. It's not gonna challenge you in this world.

Advertising and corporate speech have taken over the world in such a way that it is everywhere. We need more and more people to take the red pill so that we can really understand the world we're in and make real choices about where we wanna go.",4,731,239
"So, I've been thinking lately about myself. I have many hobbies and interests, and I enjoy doing them all. And mostly, they are not a group activity but more individual activities focused on individual activities. And I love doing them because it makes me feel like I'm learning something and I'm expanding my horizon. However, I also feel like I'm not really good at group activities or doing something together with other people. I think I need to work on it. \n\nSo, for example, yesterday, my husband and I were actually planning on going hiking in New Hampshire with his lab mate. However, yesterday I decided that I could not go because I had some projects that I wanted to work on. These are personal projects and projects related to work. So, I told him that I could not go and he should go with his friends. And of course, he was disappointed and pretty mad because of the change of plan. So, we had a little bit of an argument. And then, he left for hiking this morning. But, it makes me feel bad about it. \n\nSo, I was reflecting on myself. Maybe am I being too selfish by putting my personal project or my work-related project before family or people? So, I think I've been like this since I was young. I think I always had many interests and I was always involved in different activities. And those were usually focused on the project itself rather than the relationship with people. So, I think this is who I am, part of who I am. But it arises as some kind of problem or center of conflict when I'm in a relationship or when I'm with family, with people who I care about. I don't know how to solve this problem. And I think this will always be an issue. And I hope that my husband or my other family or friends could understand about this. But I also understand that it might be a little selfish desire for other people to understand that I'm putting my work and my project behind them. That's why I'm feeling a little bit. Not depressed, but feeling a little bit of self-reflection time here.","I don't feel I have friends, I have people I know and it's fun to hang around, but I don't have anybody to explain my problems to that would stay and listen and help me how I need to be helped. Most likely if I tried with the people I know, they will just tell me it's normal to feel that way, comfort me for a while and keep with their day without looking back at me twice to make sure I am okay.

My family is okay, they don't hate me, and I don't hate them. But we have sort of a cold relationship. We care little for one another, and although we enjoy seeing each other and spend time together, it's not that I feel too connected to them.

My studies right now don't fill me in any way. I am just continuing what the people around me expect me to do, doing a degree that suits my interests (if I had any). And yes, now and then I do have fun and enjoy the lessons. But it always comes back to the point of indifference.

I don't know what I am doing with my life, and not sure that I want to do anything with it. Not because I am lazy and prefer to do leisure activities, but because I don't have willpower to even spend an afternoon reading or playing.

It's a horrible feeling to be empty. Of emotions, of care, of anything. And it feels that I am trying to fill a glass that has holes at the bottom, I will fill it if I keep pouring stuff in it, but the second I stop it will lose all its content and I'll end up where I started.",3,429,337
"So, I have a friend who recently lost his father due to a tragic car accident. And I heard this news on a day of going for dinner. I felt really bad for my friend, and I was so heartbroken because I know how kind and sweet of a person my friend is. So, I could see that although I haven't seen his father, I could see that he must have grown in a very happy family. And he talked about his father a couple of times, so I know that he loves his family and his father, of course. So, I know how difficult it would be for him. It was very difficult for me also, thinking about it. I felt so powerless. I feel like nothing could comfort him in this situation. So, I felt really bad that I could not do much for him. It also got me to think about my own family as well. How would I feel if my dad suddenly passed away? I couldn't even imagine that. And I have a really good relationship with my dad, and I talk with him about everything. So, losing someone that important, that close, and who supports you, who made you actually, in this, would be unimaginable. I've experienced that with my grandparents, but I think it's very different from losing your parents. So, yeah, it got me thinking about relationships and death in life, in general. So, I think it's inevitable. I will die someday also. And I will see my parents die someday. So, I should always take the moments in time preciously because it's not going to last forever. This tragic happened to my friend just got me thinking a lot about those kinds of philosophical questions. Sometimes, just thinking about that makes me feel so humble and makes me feel like everything is less important than I am actually thinking it is. But yeah, I don't know how to... I guess I'm trying to think on a brighter side. It can also broaden my perspective somehow and embrace the difficult moments in life as more grateful. But I was very heartbroken to hear my friend's youth. And yeah, I just thought I wanted to share this story to hear what you think about.","I'm 22. I knew a kid in high school, and he and his brother were close to my mom (who taught at our school). They were a year ahead. I just heard he's dying of stage 4 cancer. He got diagnosed as stage 4 right off the bat months ago and now is just waiting to die.

I'm of the opinion that people have the right to be forgotten, and I don't try to bother those I knew in school, but we were loose friends and I don't know what to do or say. Obviously, it's not my place to speak to him or his family, and I really don't even know if it's my place to grieve, but I am.

I don't know how to wrap my head around someone randomly going to the doctor and essentially getting prescribed a headstone and a shrug.",3,443,170
"Okay. So this isn't really anything exciting? It's not an exciting story. But it's something that I learned recently about myself. So I thought it'd be interesting to share. Wait, let me take a look at my note. So, I think when I was young, younger, I really wanted to achieve something in life really fast. And I wanted to be recognized as a successful person. So I had this very big desire. But I'm so naturally I searched for a field or area where I thought I have a competitive advantage. And one of the fields or professions that I found that I could do better than other people was in the creative writing field. So I got a lot of compliments from teachers and family and friends about my writing skills or my imaginations. So when I was like early twenties, I wanted to become a famous novelist or successful TV scriptwriter or a filmmaker. So I did internships, and I worked as a writer at a radio station, like a production company and youth agency. But I didn't last long in those fields because I was so impatient. I wanted to be really this famous writer. But what I was at the time was like a low-paying freelance writer and I could not bear that difficulties, and could not. I didn't have like, it wasn't like because fortunately, I had the support of my family. Even though I was low pay. I didn't have to worry too much about financial issues, but I was just very disgruntled about how, the stage I was in, I guess. So I felt like I'm like the lowest person in this organization. And nobody really listens to me, and I couldn't stand that struggle. So I called it quits, and I jumped to the other area or field and industry. And I think when I look back, I think I was very immature and impatient at the time. If I was a little bit wiser, I would have seen those struggles and difficulty of learning opportunities, or opportunities to grow. But I just really wanted to be at the finish line rather than going through this step by step. So now, today I'm in a completely different field and not doing anything related to writing. Although I believe writing is very essential in all kinds of work and industry. Now I think I'm a little bit, I've learned my lesson from the past experience. However, today I felt like I was like the younger self. I was feeling a little bit agitated about who I am right now. And I was comparing myself to whom I want to be in the future. And I would not be very satisfied about myself, but since I had older now, and I'm more experienced. Not immediately, but I kind of try to remind myself the outcome that I had. If I have that kind of mentality. So I guess I'm trying to self-talk, trying to reinforce myself more in a more positive way. And rather than jump to the end result. I'm trying to enjoy this moment. I know it sounds very cliché, but I'm really trying to be grateful about my surroundings and who I am right now. I think it's good for my mind. And I think it's more, it gives me more motivation and energy to continue to work on my future goals.","I went to culinary school when I was 16 years old. In the beginning, I wasn't really planning to be a chef. I wanted to travel to different countries. I didn't speak all the languages in the countries I wanted to go to. This meant I had to find something to do that can make money in the countries I was planning to go to.

Once I found my path, once I decided that was my path, my family and friends kinda pulled me back to try and take me off that path. It's important to stay on that path and kind of ignore all that.

If you do not follow your path, it's tough to be successful. You have to follow your path, whatever it is. It's very important to listen to people too. But, whatever you think of it, you have to follow your own path.",4,660,171
"So today, I want to share a story about my history as a driver. I have a reputation for being a bad driver, especially among my family and friends, because I have some stories of me making some bad decisions as a driver. So first of all, when I first bought my car when I was, like, 21, I think 21, I bought a car and I took the car and was driving back home with it. While I was trying to turn left, there was a huge truck right next to me with a long trailer. And of course, as a new driver, I wasn't very good at gauging the distance, so I hit the truck's trailer with the right side of my bumper. So I ruined my first car. I think it was after ten minutes, it was more than, like, 50 minutes after I started to drive. So that's the first story. And obviously, I was very heartbroken, but thankfully, I didn't get hurt and the truck driver didn't get hurt. He was super nice and said it's okay and nothing is too damaged, just my car, so he let me go. So yeah, that was the story of me on my first car. The second story is that while I was driving with four friends in my car, I ran into a reversed way, so I saw another car coming right at us very far, and my friend sitting next to me started to scream, like, started to scream, and she got really scared. Thankfully, I saw another way out on the side, so I immediately, like, as soon as I saw the car coming right at me, I turned my wheel and then entered a different lane. So unfortunately, well, I didn't kill anybody and nobody got hurt, but it kind of was a really scary moment. And then when I was in San Francisco, I was in the Bay Bridge, there was a lot of traffic jammed, a lot of congestion in the Bay Bridge, and I was driving, I thought I was just casually driving, but then suddenly, when the car in front of my car stopped because of the traffic jam, the driver right in front of my car came out, and she started to scream at me. I didn't understand what she was saying because I was inside my car, but then I kind of realized that she was saying I was tailgating her, I was driving too close to her car, so she got really mad. Yeah, and there are a lot more stories of me hitting a wall while I was driving, I was trying to park. These stories kind of shaped me as a bad driver. But now, and also my husband, he doesn't like me driving because he thinks I'm reckless. But in my perspective, I think my husband is driving like he's driving too safely. He always tries to never, ever go beyond the speed limit. And I think that's just too strict. I think it's okay, I mean, you have to abide by the rules, but he's just always abiding by the rules. And for example, at a stop sign, I stop at the stop sign, but he scolds me because I don't stop for, like, 5 seconds or something. And he thinks that we have to keep that five-second rule or something. So, like driving, I was very stressed because of the driving. When I drive and my husband's next to me, we always fight. So, I kind of stopped driving and I let him drive. It's been a while since I haven't driven for a long time, but recently, I started to. Recently, I have this urge to drive, and I feel like I want to drive because I just want to feel more independent and I just want to have a lifestyle and that kind of lifestyle that I want to pursue kind of needs driving. So, I want to, like, for example, I want to go hiking on the weekends to a different state somewhere far, and I also want to go to the beach whenever I want to go and I want to listen to music in my car and have my own time or something in solitude. And I also sometimes want to drive motorcycles. For me, I think it's important to get back to driving and also, I don't want to hurt anybody or put anybody in danger like I did in the past. So, I want to also be a good driver as well. So, it's my goal to start driving again and also to be a confident, good driver.","I was driving home from the attorney's office with fresh keys in my pocket, after I just signed the papers to close on my new home. The weather was beautiful, and I was on cloud nine as I drove down the interstate to celebrate with my wife and kids before soccer practice. I decided to take an express lane to get home faster and was exiting back onto the normal roadway when everything seemed fine. I checked my mirrors and looked back to my right, as I was merging from the left, and saw plenty of space to merge.

As I was almost completely merged, I felt a soft (extremely soft) bump, and then a second or so passed and I heard the blast of my horn. It was such a slight impact that it took me a moment to realize that I actually was just in an accident. I looked back in the mirror and waved to the driver that I was going to get over to the right-hand shoulder and pull over.

As I eventually pulled over, the driver of the car got out and started yelling, and then the passenger of the car got out and was even more mad. I got out to assess my car and theirs, and I see that they are already calling the police. I thought to myself that this was no big deal, as my car barely had a scratch on it and theirs only had minor damage.

As we waited for the police, I began to process things and realized that I am probably going to be ticketed, even though they were the ones that initiated contact with me and hit me in the back. But because I was the one merging, I was going to be at fault. I thought more and more about it and I reassured myself that I had plenty of room.

As things progressed, I was ticketed, and I talked to the other driver, and she talked about how she worked at a body shop and could fix the car at little cost. She said that they were alright and were okay, and then they left.

Later on, I found out that they were trying to get a large settlement from my insurance company and hired a lawyer, and were claiming injury. It hit me at that point, that I think they were trying to pull an insurance scam. They knew that I would be at fault for merging, and they could get money out of the situation.

Now, when I think of that day, I can only think of the accident and how I was taken advantage of, and I don't really feel happy about closing on my new house.",4,918,503
"When I was a little kid, I used to play chess all the time. I used to be really good at it too. At one point, I was ranked 20th in the country, and I used to go to tournaments all the time. I used to go to places like Las Vegas, San Diego, and I used to spend all my weekends just at tournaments. It was pretty fun, and it was nice for my parents to drive me all that way so that I could compete in chess tournaments.","No one thinks about bobsledding as a kid, especially around here, sunny southern California. You see it on TV during the Olympics, and that's it. It's just not something that you think about doing at a young age.

When I came to UCLA, even by my fourth, fifth year, I was like, what am I gonna do? Track's almost over, I keep getting hurt throwing javelin, and it's just like, what next? That's when my coach encouraged me to try out for bobsledding. Never been in a sled before, never been on ice before, but you have to realize what can I do now that I'll not be able to do later on?

You can't go back and bobsled in ten years, you have to do it now. This is the only time you can do it. So I was like, I gotta go do this, I gotta try it now or else I'll never know. And that ultimately led to Korea for the Winter Olympic Games.

So for me, my goal has always been the same, to make the Olympics. I just didn't realize it would be in bobsledding, but here I am.",3,101,237
"But yeah, one time I went kayaking in Seattle with my girlfriend. And we were in a tandem kayak. So we were both on the same kayak, both trying to pedal. And as a joke, I started pedaling backwards, and she was confused as to why she wasn't moving forward.","A couple of months ago, I started going on wilderness adventures with my family. It was amazing to go, just my girlfriend and I, but it was even cooler when we were able to take the kids. My girlfriend and I found this amazing river with beautiful plants and unique rocks along the shore. The water was very clear and calm, and we wanted to take the kids kayaking and for a picnic.

When we arrived, we had the kids assist in helping set up the inflatable kayaks, and then we broke off into two teams to head down the river. My girlfriend and our daughter were in one kayak, and I was in the other with our son. We had a lot of fun racing down the river, checking out the landscape, and watching fish jump out of the water.

We got to shore at a great picnic area and spent the afternoon eating lunch and fishing. Sadly, we did not catch any fish, but it was fun trying. We also found and explored a nearby cave.

The kayaking trip back to the car was a bit tougher as my arms were tired and our son was just relaxing in the back of the kayak. My arms started to get pretty sore, but we managed. Once back, I carried the kayaks and everything back to the car so that we could load up and head home.

During the drive home, my girlfriend and I discussed brights and why they are needed. Sure enough, we ended up having to stop due to deer being in the road! We were able to navigate down the mountain safely and then got home, showered, and went to bed.",4,59,318
"It. Yeah? So last? When I was seven years old, I moved back to India from the United States.","My parents migrated from Italy. None of them had education. My parents want me to go to local college. I had enormous pressure. My parents wanted me to be a dentist because that was a way to upward mobility. They actually had a little family intervention to convince me to be a dentist. 

I told my parents I got into MIT, which I thought was a big deal, to study urban planning, and they don't let in a lot of students. My mother and father looked kinda dazed. They didn't know what MIT was. 

I found myself convincing my parents a lot. You just have to follow what you really love, and you can't let people drive you off-track. I can only say from my experience. When I do things that are true to me, they're successful. When I do things that are not true to me, they are not successful.",5,24,175
"So last winter, I went skiing in Big Bear, California. And I\'ve been skiing before, but this particular time, the snow was really wet. It wasn\'t soft. There wasn\'t a lot of snow that year, and so I had a hard time braking. So, I fell down a lot. It sounds painful, but it was actually kind of funny because I went on the steeper slopes, and my friends were like, ""you should just do it."" And then I did it. And then I started to fall. But in the end, it was pretty fun, even though I felt weak. We went and got some ramen after, some Fu afterwards. And the warmth of the Fu really helped warm me up after falling in the snow all day.","My wife and I traveled to Italy and did an amazing hike in the Dolomite mountain range. I had wanted to do this hike for many years and had researched it quite a bit. I knew it was going to be difficult, but I had no idea how much so. We started early in the morning, and for about four hours, we just kept climbing up higher and higher. It was even more difficult because there were loose rocks under us for much of it.

Every time we reached what we thought was the top, another long uphill awaited us. Finally, after what I figured was another false top, we came up and it was as though we were at the top of the world. There below us, spreading for 360 degrees, were what seemed like thousands of craggy mountain peaks. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. We both started to cry; it was so beautiful.

There was more crazy hiking to do, however, as we had to use ropes that had been attached to the mountain during World War I to traverse some cliffs and small waterfalls. That was the most difficult part for my wife, and I was so proud of her that she did it. I think she surprised herself.

It was really one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. Even though we pretty much killed ourselves doing it, I think we would both do the same hike again in a heartbeat.",3,154,278
"There used to be this pizza place in India called Pizza Corner, and they had this special dish called a Koniza, which is basically a pizza wrapped into a cone. And it was one of my favorite things to get from that restaurant. And the Konisa is not available widely anymore, mostly because they just don't sell it anymore at Pizza Corner. So I hope that they bring it back someday because that's one of the things I really enjoyed for my childhood in India.","Today, I asked my mum how she made that rice with saffron. After I ate the rice, I remembered a meat replacement she made for me when I was vegetarian. She put together mushrooms and zucchini, rolled it in egg, and put breadcrumbs around it. Then, she fried it in a pan.

She put so much thought into it. Even after she came home from work, she wanted to make a good meal for me. I'm so thankful for all those meals she cooked. It makes me happy.

I love my mum.",5,94,108
"Yeah, so when I first started grad school, actually throughout college for undergraduate and graduate school, I didn't do a very good job of balancing my time between exercising, doing schoolwork, and making time for my friends. And I think it's an ongoing process of improving, but I think I've gotten better over the past few years because lately, I've been doing a good job of making sure I go to the gym and do exercise, and also getting my work done and being organized. And I also do make time for my friends. It's not a lot of time, but I still do make time. So I think it's a work in progress, but I've gotten way better at managing my time in the last five or six years.","I got a part-time job at the brewery. I was working on the bottling line, and then our CEO needed help in doing office work, and I had experience doing office work, so I started doing that. It wasn't like a big career vision. It was just like someone asked, someone needed help, I could help her. So you can imagine making the transition from philosophy to finance.

Then I was Chief Operations Officer, and now I'm Sustainability Director. So all of those junctures have been a ""What am I doing? Is this what I wanna be doing with my life?""

Career doesn't have to be the fullness of your identity. And I think sometimes we expect it to fulfill a lot. Sometimes the stress is necessary for growth, but you also need that time for recovery and ease because that's when you sort of integrate your gains. And you can't always be sprinting and you can't always be coasting.",4,152,188
"So, story from my childhood. There's a lot. I grew up in Ohio, and it's a funny place to grow up. I remember playing in the backyard a lot, of sports and stuff. We used to always go down to Myrtle Beach for vacation, with some of my friends from the neighborhood. I think a lot about those times and just kind of growing up in the Midwest is interesting. Part in the early 90s. It's an interesting time, interesting place to grow up mostly good, mostly good, but just what a life.","My music taste has definitely changed as I grew up, but there are a few songs that always invoke feelings of nostalgia when time was much more peaceful and enjoyable. One of these songs is called ""Bubbly"" by Colbie Caillat, and I heard it playing today at Trader Joe's while I was buying some groceries. It was such a weird and nostalgic experience, and I stuck around even after I paid to listen to the full thing play out.

I remember being in kindergarten where we had a designated ""nap time,"" and the teacher would always play this song softly in the background. I remember being picked up by mom and going to get a snack after school with this song playing on the radio.

It was so weird realizing that all of this happened and is a part of me, and I know that sounds really dumb, but it's just grounding to notice how far you've come with everything. I'm now in college away from that easy-going life of a little kindergartner, where all I had to worry about was what outdoor game me and my friends would play or what fun things I would do with my family over the weekend.

It's just crazy to me how times change, but at the end of it all, I'm still me. It's even more crazy to me how just a simple 3-minute song made me have so many thoughts at the same time.",2,111,272
"Sure. So, I was thinking while I was at the park about how when I grew up, I grew up with my father primarily, and he didn't really know how to talk to me or communicate with me, but we spent a lot of time playing. Sports, playing games, playing with toys, just kind of like playing outside. And he always took me to play, and he was always kind of physically there, not very in touch, but always kind of demanding that I play. It made it a little less fun because he was a coach and very into sports. And so, it was kind of not as fun as I think he intended, but one thing that I am grateful for is that he always did play with me. He was always there to play with me, and that's how he kind of knew how to connect with me, just playing all the time. The first things I can remember playing, like fast feet, fluffy little games on the sidewalk, things like that. So, I'm grateful that that's how we connect with me. But sometimes I wish that he would have had more of an expanded kind of toolkit in terms of how to connect and interact and kind of be there. So, I think about that, both grateful for that and it's both challenging. It's challenging to connect with him today because that's all he knew. That's all he knows is kind of like exercise and play.","My dad was the kind of person whose only 2 goals in life were to have fun and to make others have fun. But now he's been gone for almost 5 years, and everyone's still in the ""let's be sad and only gather together to cry about his tragically short life"" phase.

Whenever I try to make jokes, even to people who weren't even affected by his death, usually all I get is awkward smiles and worried looks. Some even go as far as saying it was inappropriate. And there are the ones who laugh but say, ""oh my god, I shouldn't laugh at this.""

I know that if he was able to do so, he'd be the one making these jokes about his death. He wouldn't want to see us being sad because of him, of all people. While he was alive, he was the one who would've moved mountains if that was what we needed to make us smile. Why do they think this changed in his death?

And even if he was the sourest, most serious, and least fun person in the world, I should be allowed to grieve him how I want to. Grief shouldn't be about the deceased person but about the ones they left behind.",1,291,246
"Cool. So today, I was looking at photos of some friends. It was a friend's birthday today, and I was looking at photos from maybe ten years, from 2006 to probably 2014. Gosh, I don't know, ten to 2014. I guess maybe somewhere around there. Anyways, I was just thinking about how my friends and I used to go hike in college and just have fun and build forts. We were already old, but it was still fun to do that. And I was sending some photos to some other friends, and I was just thinking about a vacation that we went on in high school. That was wild and fun. And it was just interesting to see photos of us from when we were younger. And it made me think of how young we were and how young I was and how much we've all grown. And we look different and we were different. We were closer friends then, and now we're all grown up. And some of my friends are lawyers, and I work in artificial intelligence. And it was just interesting to look back on those photos today and back on photos throughout my life. But particularly on the photos of my friends. It's nice, I guess, to remember being so close to those people, even though we were all young and it was messy and we weren't responsible adults, emotionally or in any other way. But it was nice to be so close with my friends during those years past.","Today, I saw photos and videos of old friends spending time together, and I don’t know why it still hurts after all this time, but it does. They’re so close to each other, and they just look so happy. 

They were like the older counterpart to my friend group in school, and they were always welcoming and good to me. I know I was happy there, and I wish I was still connected to that group and to my own. 

Those are the people I grew up with and should have graduated with, and the people I should have gotten to see every time I came home from college, but now I’m living in a completely different state from them. 

It’s been years, and I should be over this by now, but somehow I still haven’t moved on.",1,292,164
"Yeah, so I was talking with my father last night, and he was repeating himself a lot. And he mentioned about that his wife is concerned about his cognitive decline in terms of dementia. And some of my earlier memories were with my grandfather, his father, who had Alzheimer\'s, and he lived in our house. And it was pretty brutal to see him losing his mind. But I told my father that I don\'t think that it\'s related to Alzheimer\'s or Dementia. I think he literally just debate intellectually or emotionally, like most people do. He doesn\'t have conversations with people about their lives. He doesn\'t like participating in social events. He doesn\'t ask questions to learn about people. He never really wanted to do anything or participate in any ways. He doesn\'t know how to use a computer. You can\'t buy a plane ticket. He can\'t travel alone. He doesn\'t know how to manage his finances. He doesn\'t manage his finances. He doesn\'t really do anything. So in my opinion, his lack of participation and cognitive processes and general kind of life interest is really kind of a self-fulfilling process of his cognitive decline. There are plenty of people I know that are far older than him that really love learning or cooking or reading or hiking or exploring different ways to kind of nurture what they enjoy to do and kind of stay active and healthy in their lives in that way. But really, the only thing that my father likes to do is to sit on the couch, go jogging, and drink beer. And it\'s been that way for his whole life. Yeah, that\'s just been on my mind. And it\'s annoying to hear him say, like, ""Oh, jamie\'s worried about me."" But really, in my opinion, it\'s the result of his personal preferences and behaviors and limitations.","A few weeks ago, I went to visit my elderly father. He's a terrific man but has a way about him that is a little intimidating. He's always been in control of everything around him. As I was growing up, I saw him as Superman. The years have taken their toll, and he is now in his late 80s and having problems with his health and his memory. It's hard to see Superman become human.

During my visit, I stayed with him at the retirement home, and we had wonderful conversations about life, family, what we think happens to us after this life, etc. I felt so honored that he was confiding in me some of his most personal thoughts and fears. I felt closer to him than I ever had before. We talked about how much he missed my mother, who passed away a few years ago. We talked about how he hopes to be remembered. We just talked about life in general.

Towards the end of the visit, he told me that he had his lawyer draw up papers making me his power of attorney and his healthcare power of attorney. He said I was the only one he trusted to always keep his best interest at heart. I'm the youngest of two children, so I assumed my older brother would be the one he would pick for this.

I had gone to visit my elderly father, but when I left for home, I was leaving what felt like my best friend and confidant.",1,360,289
"Yeah. So, a story that I thought of was my father texted me pictures from Google Maps of the old apartment that we used to live in. And he was like, ""I love that. That was the greatest of times. People love talking to you because you could talk like an adult. And your grandmother helped us out so much."" And I didn\'t really have great memories of that time in my life or talking to anyone. So, yeah, it was just interesting to talk about those differences. I asked him if he had a plan for us to move into a house or anything like that. And he said no, that he was just trying to kind of get by to make sure that we had everything that we needed. So, that was just an interesting conversation about my past. Yeah.","In June of 2019, my fiance and I began the process of searching for a new home. The process was long and grueling. We saw tons of houses in our area. We have never been so overwhelmed. After seeing about 10 different townhouses/homes, we decided to use a realtor to assist. Jim was great to work with. He knew exactly what we wanted and was immediately able to provide us recommendations. 

We finally started seeing houses that we really liked. We ended up finding a house and loved it. We put an offer in, but were rejected as someone else came in with a much stronger offer. We were devastated. However, we didn't realize how lucky we were. Jim showed us one more house. The house was completely redone, in our hometown, and close to two major highways. We were so lucky that we didn't get the prior house as this one was better. 

We knew as soon as we walked through that this was the one. We put an offer, but that was rejected. After some negotiating, we provided an offer that was accepted. After a few months of searching diligently, we finally found our house. This was honestly one of the most memorable moments of my entire life. You can only buy your first home one time.",1,162,251
"Yeah, I had like a really good learning from a friend, well, acquaintances really, at a bar. And essentially, there\'s two acquaintances, friends. One is named John Ross and the other is named Alfred. John Ross is like 39 and Alfred\'s 89. And Alfred leaned over to me and he asked me a question. And he said, ""Are you happy?"" And I said, ""Sometimes."" And he said, ""Well, that makes sense because happiness can be like that."" And he said, ""More importantly, are you content?"" And I said, ""Very recently, I\'ve become content."" And he said, ""You are with your life where your life has gone. Are you content with where you are and all that?"" And I said, ""Yes, I\'m very content, very recently."" And that was a great learning. And we talked about it for a little while, and people seem to really latch onto that. And it was an amazing kind of shared experience.","During the moon landing project, I saw people who did the best work of their lives in that situation. And I got really interested in one question: What are the conditions under which people do their best, most fulfilling work? 

In other words, I got more interested in people than in science. And once I knew that, once I was clear about the fact that I found something I absolutely loved, there was no doubt that I was gonna continue asking questions about how do I learn about people? 

It's still the most frequently asked question I get: How did you go from math to psychology? 

The key to knowing what to do is knowing who you are.",5,210,133
"Recently, as I've become more, I guess instead of gotten to know my friends more, and the more we've been through and the more conversations we have, and the more people I've met through their lives, and yeah, just the more time I've spent with them, I've just really gained appreciation for them, and for their friendship. And that's kind of unique to feel like a true appreciation that you found some really good friends.","I have felt this way for as long as I remember. Basically, every time I hang out with a big group of friends, I always feel really sad afterwards, almost like crashing after being drunk.

I look around the room where we all hung out and it's empty and quiet again. And I think about where everyone is in that moment, having gone back to their own lives.

I think about the fleetingness and specialness of moments when we all hang out together because as you get older, people go through different stages of life, and it gets harder to find time.

It's very different compared to when everyone was in school or college. I don't have a problem spending time by myself. I love having privacy and alone time, and I'm a total introvert.

I also wouldn't consider myself lonely. I live with my SO and see my close friends at least once a week.

But big social hangouts still remind me of how precious and delicate our lives are.",1,91,194
"Okay. So, today, I wanted to have a doughnut, and I went to the donut shop. And the lady there gave me two donuts for the price of one. So, that was very nice because I got two donuts.","There's this woman that goes around town who sells beauty products, clothes, cleaning products, small appliances, and pretty much anything a small business can offer. I was paying for the product I bought from her, and she just randomly said I looked good in my leggings and I looked long-legged.

For someone who's been bullied throughout my childhood for how I looked, this made my heart flutter. She just gave me the confidence to wear leggings out in public.",4,47,91
"Hello. Yesterday, I found out that my partner won't be able to visit me here in the US, and that made me very sad because I was looking forward to seeing them, spending some time together, and being comforted by that. So now, I'm despondent.","About one month ago, I received an unexpected text message from my friend. He and I had not spoken in almost two years, because we had a falling out towards the end of 2017. This was a friend I made in graduate school, and with whom I used to hang out fairly regularly for about four years. We would go to the movies, go hiking, have lunch, and other things. I helped him through a particularly rough patch when he lost two people close to him and went through a breakup within a year's span. I was glad to have him as a friend, and we could talk about important matters with one another.

At one point, however, our friendship became very strained, and we had an argument, after which we didn't speak for almost two years. When I received that text (which was simply a ""Hi, how are you?""), I was very unsure about whether to respond to it or not. I put it off for a few hours but finally decided to answer back. I did not receive a response for several days and was not sure what happened: whether he was experiencing a major issue or just wanted to be friends again.

When he finally texted me back several days later, it turned out he was reaching out to invite me to his wedding. He was getting married the next month and wanted to reconnect and make amends. I was taken aback because I had not expected to ever hear from him again. I was cautious about going but decided to accept his invitation after consulting with a few people about whether it would be a good idea.

The wedding was in just a few weeks, so it was short notice, and this would be the first time we were seeing each other in almost two years. I was afraid it would be awkward or tense. Luckily, the wedding was a beautiful occasion, and I was glad I went and was able to reconnect with him after all this time. His wife is a very intelligent and lovely woman, and I am happy for him, especially after the difficult time he went through.",3,55,412
"Hello. So, I was at the library, and I ran into a friend whom I hadn't seen since high school. And that was great. We went out to have some coffee. But I forgot what I had gone to the library for in the first place, which was to work on an assignment. So, I turned that in late.","I feel tired now and wanted to have short conversations. There's an hour of time-saving here, which makes it night already, even though it is still bright outside. 

I feel so tired of work. I don't feel like making friends like my classmates. 

Kind of annoying to have online classes, even though no one cares about Covid here.",3,70,68
"Today, I had dinner with a new friend, and I really enjoyed it. I think it makes me feel a bit more at home to find friends that I really click with.","A few weeks ago, I went to dinner with my boyfriend and my best friend. I'd known my best friend since we were pre-teens, and this was the first time they had met. It went really well! I'd been dating him for nearly a year, and it'd taken quite some time for our schedules to line up. I think this delay in meeting gave me some pent-up anxiety about it finally happening.

My friend texted me, asking if I'd like to get dinner, and I let her know that I was with my boyfriend at the time. We got burgers and wings at a place nearby. The food was great, but the company was better.

We ended up seeing a couple of people that my friend and I knew. When we finished eating, we spent some time speaking to them. It was nice to catch up with old friends.

Afterwards, we went back to my friend's house, where my boyfriend fell in love with her dog. Seeing them interact was adorable since my dog is a senior and doesn't quite play as much.

It was great to spend time with two people I value and care about, and to see them getting along so well. I'm looking forward to spending more time with the two of them in the future.",2,36,252
"Are you listening? Right now, I guess I'll start. I'm not sure if you're listening, I guess. The two most meaningful stories we can start out with, from the beginning. I can tell you the story of my adoption. I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and at about the age somewhere between eight to 15 months, I was abandoned on post office steps. And then, I'm assuming taken to a local orphanage. At about 21 months, the adoption was arranged for my family, which I'm very lucky to have, but I'll go back into a little more detail of my adoption.\n\nFrom what I know, I was abandoned on post office steps and then taken to an orphanage. And then, my family was tracked down. I was told that my birth father was deceased and my birth mother couldn't take care of me. After they had contacted my family, my birth uncle tried to take me and take care of me, but that also he just couldn't handle it. And so then I was finally released for the adoption process. So, at about 21 months, I came over to the United States to my current loving, loving family. I feel very fortunate and I never kind of felt empty inside about the whole adoption. I get a little emotional just talking about it because honestly, it feels very surreal. I've always had a very loving family and so there's nothing that I should be feeling bad about. I was lucky to have my parents have two biological children, John and Betsy. They're about eight and nine years older than me, so I was definitely the baby of the family, but I never grew up feeling different. In fact, sometimes I joke that I'm just a white girl, which might seem a little derogatory, but I have never felt different or undervalued in my life. Well, from this, if anything, I feel very blessed and fortunate to have landed where I did and all the immense opportunities that have been before me. I really, honestly couldn't feel luckier about the family that I had.","I was raised by a single mom, an immigrant from Guatemala. I don't even know my father. That was a huge struggle. I was one of those at-risk kids and I had no inkling about going into anything at that point. I just started joining as many clubs as I could. One of the clubs I joined was the Future Teachers Club. I was like, okay, let me just join this and see what it's all about. I had no inkling about going into education.

The teacher who ran the club, I don't know what she saw in me, but she introduced me to the Golden Apple Foundation. I became one of the Golden Apple scholars and joined their family. I feel I'm one of the few blessed people who had the chance to turn my life around. The only reason was because of teachers.

For me to get where I am, a lot of people had to dedicate time to me. It's only right that I do the same for others if I had the opportunity. Teaching is a blessing to me.",2,415,209
"It's not an Astoria that happened recently. It's a story in my past. And the strongest emotion I felt here was shame. It was when I was in fifth grade. That's a time in adolescence when you're pudgy and awkward. And I remember being the target of bullying, where people were mooing at me, and I just felt absolutely terrible. And the teachers had to intervene. That's not even the real shame part that I feel. The shame part that I feel is that a week later there was another young girl that was the target of the same bullying, and I participated in it. Because now looking back, I guess I just really wanted to be a part of the group. And so I joined in. And I just feel absolutely terrible about having made somebody else feel the same way that I did.","Dealing with racist issues in Texas, in the south, in the 80s really impacted my academic self-esteem. Once I got past that, I had a teacher who encouraged me, who basically did a very simple thing. He told me that you define you. If you define yourself, it's got to be up to you. That completely changed my life at the age of ten.

When you go through a period of your life where you don't believe in yourself very much, and then the light comes on and all of a sudden you believe that, ""Wow, I can do anything I set my mind to. If only I knew what I wanted to set my mind to.""

I have a big issue with prioritizing because there's a lot that I want to do right now. And so when you try to do everything, that's when you get frustrated.",1,166,172
"I\'ll do a part two to my adoption story, something that surfaced when I was about 25 years old and so quite a while after my adoption. I took a graduate study and we traveled to Korea, and it was my first time back to Seoul, South Korea. Since, basically since my adoption. And I don\'t know if I\'ve had that many emotions running through me at any other point in my life, but it was just such a blend of elevated highs of feeling connected and just moments of pure peace, to the other extreme of extreme disruption with who I identified with what I had thought I was up until that point. I even took a little medallion that I had, that was from when I came over, that had the name of my orphanage and I had a cab driver take me there. And I saw all the little kids that were there. And then they showed me a picture of myself that I had never seen before. And it completely threw me into a complete unraveling. I had panic attacks for a good two weeks plus after that, where I couldn\'t breathe. I didn\'t know who I was, where I was supposed to be going. And it took a long time for me to kind of situate myself back to ""I am a blend of everything. I\'m not just one or the other."" I don\'t have to feel guilty or wondering about my birth family and where they are. But it really did take a long time for me to calm down my emotions, so I wasn\'t having panic attacks anymore. And I still feel like it has a bit of a ripple effect.","I grew up in Nanjing, China. When I was a baby, I lost my right leg in a fire. Shortly after that, I was abandoned on the street. I was found at a year and a half old and taken to the local government orphanage. Fortunately for me, I was adopted when I was seven years old and came here to the states.

When I was 14 years old, I received a running prosthetic. The day that I ran, I remember it being one of the most traumatizing days of my whole life. That was the first time that I was going to have to be out. I was going to have to show people that this is who I am, that I couldn't hide, that I was an amputee.

I got out there and I started running, and I realized I love to do this. This is so liberating. This is so freeing because I am out, and this is who I am.

I don't think you ever get one moment, have one experience, and you totally accept everything about who you are. That's a lifelong journey. But the start of that is finding something that allows you to be you.",2,319,232
"Yeah, I guess this is more a recent kind of thing that I\'ve been mulling through in my head. I have a really good friend who\'s been a good friend for the past few years. And recently, she\'s just been so negative. Actually, not recently, for a while now she\'s been so negative. And then I can\'t help but also feel negative. And then it also feels as if she\'s starting to be negative towards me. And so my initial reaction, and this is a problem of mine, is to just say, ""alright, screw it. She\'s not a very good friend. Don\'t need to invest time there."" But I also think that it\'s really worthwhile to have strong friendships. I just sometimes get really disappointed with my friend\'s behavior. Or I tend to see that they\'re very selfish. And I don\'t really know what to do about it because I do think it\'s worthwhile building and working on it. And so sometimes I almost think it\'s almost like a marriage. It\'s like you talk things through and work through it. But the other side of me is kind of like, ""there\'s just not enough time in the day to worry about unhealthy factors in my life.""","She moved across the country, and for the last year, we've remained really close, and she would always be the first person I'd want to talk to, and vice versa. But lately, there's been a shift in our relationship, and I just don't feel like she actually cares or is interested in me as a person anymore.

We used to talk all day, every day about anything, and now she only engages in conversation if it's for advice or for her to rant about something that's bothering her. I try to engage in more light-hearted conversations, and she immediately switches the topic to be about her. And she always says she has my back and I can tell her anything, but as of lately, I don't feel comfortable approaching her with anything that's bothering me because she either ignores me or switches the conversation.

The thing that really bothered me and I think started the shift was when I was going through a rough time and really needed a friend to talk to. I tried telling her about some things that were bothering me, and she said it wasn't healthy for me to be so negative and that I should see a specialist or doctor - so it's okay for her to complain to me daily about her issues but tells me I should find a specialist? That rubbed me the wrong way, especially from someone I've built a lot of trust with.

I'm just feeling like we're drifting apart, and I can't keep putting in the effort for a one-sided friendship. I'm afraid that will just be the end of the friendship.",5,248,312
"I don't know if it's interesting. I'm kind of gearing more towards emotional triggers in my storytelling. I guess this one is going to be about having to work with a really aggressive coworker and kind of working through how to handle it. So I have a product manager who is, I can flat out say, the most aggressive teammate I've ever had to deal with. And I've had a broad range of collaboration with various stakeholders. The way that I started to handle it was first to kind of be overly appeasing and make sure that she felt included. Then it just kind of continued, this perpetual sort of notion of resentment towards me, which I'm not really sure where that's founded in. I think it's kind of just she just had something she didn't like about me and she just brought it to a personal level rather than keeping it professional. I definitely tried to have heart-to-hearts with her and it seemed on the surface that everything was fine. But it's really just constant and perpetual sort of condescending tones, outright aggression, and honestly, very childish behavior. And I'm not really sure at this point, and I think the outcome is just that thankfully the teams have shuffled and I shouldn't have to have any overlap with her, which is probably the best resolution to this situation. I've definitely brought it up to my boss, my manager, and he's fully aware of it. It's just that we have such a limited fund and appetite for going out and hiring new people. We definitely don't want to have a churn with our internal teammates. So honestly, the only resolution is to basically not have to overlap her with her in work.","After leaving an abusive workplace where I had no life and no room for development at the beginning of the year, I left and started a new job. It's been fantastic to work at this amazing place that feels like somewhere I can grow. Everything seems amazing, and I'm getting great feedback. I have a job I can have a life around again, and my social life blossoms.

Today, I got dumped after a couple of months of dating this girl. Her reasoning being that she doesn't want to hurt me and her mental health is preventing her from growing and wants to work on herself. Understandable and fair, I get it and have been in her shoes.

I get called into a meeting with my manager. She tells me that my colleagues don't like my attitude and state I'm difficult to work with. I've really pushed myself at this new job and tried to grow. Giving 110% wherever I can and picking up extra shifts just to get as much experience as possible. I try to be friendly with all my colleagues, and when things get busy (I work in hospitality), I'm all action, and try to delegate and stay on it as best I can.

In my meeting, my manager told me my coworkers feel like I overstep the mark and act like the boss (even when fellow supervisors say they want me to take the reins and for me to lead). I'm told I'm scary to some staff, even when I'm always trying to be friendly and helpful to others. All around, I'm told that I'm not getting a promotion because my work attitude is wrong. I apparently treat staff like cattle, and I'm near enough told I should quit.

This all happened over a 3-day period where I was pulling an 11-hour closing shift into an early morning opening shift. And all I can think of is covering more shifts to try and improve my performance and prove myself more. Stack this with me having car trouble and I feel like my life is spiraling out of control out of nowhere.",1,335,404
"This is going to be a very empowering story. This is a moment in time in my life when I was crossing and driving into Savannah right before I was about to start grad school. So the backstory of all of this is, I was about 35 years old. I had a four-year-old, I had a job, and I just needed a career path change, so I quit my job and took some time off and decided to go back to school. The difficult time was that we lived in New Jersey, and we were deciding to go back to school, or I was going back to school in Savannah. So we had to plan this massive move. First off, it was just a big life change with having a house and a mortgage and figuring out who was going to rent that. Having a child that I had to figure out where he was going to go to preschool and daycare, and then not to mention my husband relocating too and finding a new job. It was just so much. Sometimes it was unbearable. I just kept telling myself, ""One step at a time, sell one piece at a time,"" and just little incremental steps to get us there. And so the moment in my life that was just really resounding and echoes, and I just remember it forever, was that moment when we were driving into Savannah, had the cars all packed up, all committed, got everything done. And we are driving over there\'s this large bridge that leads into Savannah, and it just has such a great view. And that moment of entering into town was just a moment of no fear and full empowerment.","When I started to go to college, I went to a really big state university. I went to Texas A&M, and I was a marketing major, and I loved the College of Business. But my second education at A&M was all of the activities that I did. Because I was exposed to so many things, I really didn't know what I wanted to do when I graduated. There were a lot of paths.

After college, I was a tech consultant. I was there for a few years and decided I needed to take a leave of absence. There was something else out there for me, and 9/11 had happened, and I went to the local Red Cross in Houston. It was where I was living. They put me in the development department, which is fundraising.

When I made my very first phone call, the story on the other line was that of somebody desperately wanting to help. And during that call, I just felt like at that moment, we were just being human. My passion and my inspiration switched like that.",1,322,210
"This isn't really a story as much as just a kind of state of emotions recently. I've been getting really overwhelmed. It just feels like one thing after another happens and nothing's really big. It's really just coming down, I guess, to like money, stress, and just having to deal with life's little hiccups that it throws at you. I've had my car in the shop for a month, and I'm looking at, I'm $1000 in, I'm looking at another $2000. Our plumbing just backed up this morning. I just feel like I'm getting really overwhelmed by little kind of human condition life stuff. No, this isn't human condition. It's more just like little incidents with life that sometimes I really just don't know how to handle it. And I just want to shut down and go into my bed, under the covers, and just shut out the world for a good week. And I feel as if there are probably healthier ways to deal with this.","I want to cry these bad thoughts/feelings inside of me out. I'm struggling really bad these days. I have no one to talk to about it, and I'm not comfortable talking to my family about personal things like my mental health or feelings.

I don't really have friends to talk to either, so things are just bottling up inside. I've learned to handle it, but I can literally feel a huge pressure just weighing me down and breaking me, and for some reason, I just think having a nice big cry would make me feel better.

Like a sobbing, messy, ugly cry with red, puffy eyes and a runny nose and uncontrollable hiccups to the point where my face and throat hurt, and I can't breathe, and it lasts for an hour, maybe.",2,203,155
"I guess recently, I don't know if I've been talking about the lack of security at my job because we're a venture-backed kind of product company. And so, we really kind of rely on outside financing to help support our growth and development. And so, there's been a lot of uncertainty now with this last venture capitalist backing, investment opportunity, whether or not our company is going to survive. And so, I've been dealing a lot with the nervousness about job security. And so, I've actually reached out to my friend who works at another product design company. And there's a really great potential opportunity over there. And so, I guess the thing that I would like to talk to you about is sometimes I feel like I'm my own worst enemy. I already kind of weigh the balances, which I guess is normal, but at the same time sometimes I already talk myself out of opportunities before I even jump into them because I'm weighing all the outcomes and seeing outcomes that probably don't even exist. And maybe just looking for reasons not to lean into something. And so, I definitely struggle with this. It sounds perfect and great, but it's kind of a whole 100% remote, and so, I just already have predetermined in my mind that for the rest of my life, I'm going to be working at home in my office by myself. And I shouldn't just talk myself out of good opportunities.","There was a pretty nasty recession. I did what a lot of people do during hard times, which is, ""Well, I'll just go to graduate school."" I ended up picking law school and worked for the same firm for seven years, and I was not happy.

If you're not happy under those circumstances, you've gotta take a step back and ask yourself, ""Well, what's going on here?"" I was at dinner with two of my friends, and I was chatting about this concept I had, and one of them just looked at me and said, ""You should open a yoga studio.""

That was May 2005 and this place was open September 2005. It was as if the second she said it, I had to do it. I do think that you should do what you feel is right for yourself.",2,288,170
"I'm going to tell you about a really, really, probably just magical moment in my life. And when I look back at one of the fondest times, that's the memory that comes right to the forefront. So the story is, I lived in Savannah for about four to three years, from 2016 to about 2019. And so my husband, child, and I used to go out to Tybee Island every weekend, all weekend. And it was just so liberating. There's an area where you can go, it's the Back River, where the Back River meets the ocean. And it just gets these tidal pools in low tide where you can go out. I'm not even exaggerating, a mile in just water that is only about ankle deep or knee deep, and it's warm, and you can see all these sea creatures. And there was just this one time that stands out. And it was just absolutely beautiful. We went all the way out to the edge, seriously probably about a mile out, and there's a breakpoint there, where there's a sandbar. And we went all the way out there and it was just a treasure trove of all these sand dollars. I remember those moments with me and my child and husband. And we saw one, and then we looked up and it was just covered in sand dollars. So we were just running around collecting as many sand dollars as we could. We were filling our hats and our buckets and anything we could use to hold the sand dollars. And it was so magical. And just the breeze and being out in the middle of nowhere, it felt like the edge of the Earth. And then on our way back, we were walking back towards the land, and this flock of pelicans just came right, just swooshed right past us. And I just closed my eyes and it's probably the most at peace I ever felt in my life. And I just try to go back and look at that moment. And I try to bring it back, almost meditative, at any time, even good times, bad times, or just quiet times. And I'm really trying to figure out how I can just find that utmost inner peace when, just in the future, whenever I just need those moments.","I grew up loving the water. I think in high school, I started paddling and kayaking, and really started to wanna be in the ocean a lot. And I went to college, and I got really into Hawaiian culture and learning about who I am, where I come from.

And through that process, I got introduced to the voyaging canoes. Pretty much ever since that first time I got in the canoe, I've been totally hooked. And it's like I've never really left the canoe.

One of the biggest things that I've learned is the balance. There's a balance out there, and life becomes a lot simpler. Humans, we seek that stuff out, and it's because it's where we find the better part of ourselves is there.

You don't just learn everything in one school, be very open-minded. Really just learn as much as you can and then internalize that and formulate who you're gonna be.",4,452,188
"Cool, great. So, I have been dealing with some pain - abdominal pain. So, I don't know if you really call that a story. It's been something I've been dealing with for the past several days - intermittent pain, but it's chronic, which is frustrating. But fortunately, that actually happened after that dinner party that I was just talking about. So, it was nice to be at the dinner party for the birthday - for the birthdays - and not have to be concerned with dealing with pain at the same time.","I ruptured my ACL and had to have surgery. The initial injury and surgery recovery has been so draining. I'm still sore and my leg is weak, but I'm in the least amount of pain that I have been in two weeks. I'm finally able to walk around the house without a brace. Things are looking up.

On top of everything, I haven't been able to take my dog on walks or play fetch like we used to. Loved ones have been coming over to help, but all I've been able to do lately is offer cuddles, which is great, but seeing how happy she was today when I was finally able to play with her on the couch was everything.",5,109,138
"Great. Like I just mentioned, I have a story to share. On my new prescription sunglasses that I just picked up in this amazing fuchsia-tinted lens, I bought the frames at Chanel, which I did not foresee myself doing, but I did. And then I bought another pair at Bulgari because I had all this money stuck in my FSA from my last job. So I took this pair of frames from Chanel to LensCrafters, and they put in, first, just a black prescription lens. But it was just so boring looking. It just looked like two black dots on my face. So I went back and decided to try out their pink tint, but it was too light, so I asked them to really saturate the color. And so I went away for a couple of weeks. And when I came back, it wasn't dark enough. So they took them back and said they can saturate it even more. And so now I have this crazy pair of fuchsia sunglasses. What do you call it? It's not bifocal. It's trifocal. But it's progressive. They're progressives. And they're nice progressives. So I've got this fun pair of sunglasses, the progressives, and I got another pair from Bulgari that they switched out for. It's like a gold frame. This is a black frame. This is like a sparkly, well, can you see it? It's sort of a sparkly black frame, like muted sparkle. Like not sequin, but just has a shimmer. And then I've got these crazy fuchsia lenses that they put inside them. And my first pair of custom-made prescription sunglasses. The whole thing. And then the other pair that I'm excited to get back soon are Bulgari. And those are like a gold frame with, what do you call it? It's a brown lens. But it does that fade where the bottom is a bit clear and transparent, and then it gets darker as it goes up the lens. Can't think of what it's called right now. Ombre. I don't know. Maybe it's ombre. I mean, they talk about that with other things, because you get peace, though. But anyway. Those also have that extra feature that a lot of sunglasses have where they block the light, the rays coming at you from a lot of different directions. But they're not as great for, say, digital screens like your phone. So I've got these crazy fuchsia ones now that are progressive. And I've got the other ones from Bulgari that will be progressive. And yeah, I'm just hooked up all of a sudden. The sunglasses.","I've never had a good quality backpack before. I've only ever had cheap ones from the dollar store or Walmart. But my parents let me order a really, really nice one and it arrived today!

It's my favorite shade of blue, super comfy, and has so many cool features. It has this little pouch on the interior where you plug in a power bank and it connects to an outer socket where you can plug your phone in!

It feels like all the pockets were designed for specific purposes (not just 3 big random pockets, but a phone pocket, a padded laptop pocket, a power bank pocket, a pencil case, etc.). It even has a little lock on the top!

It's absolutely awesome.",2,524,145
"I have a job interview coming up, and I had maybe 15 different recruiters reach out to me about it. A bunch were giving the same cap for what the company would pay. There's a contract rule, but it's Google and they can pay so much more. And I live in the heart of Boston. I mean, it's just silly. It's not just a typical research role, it's a team lead role. Anyway, so I got to deal with the recruiters and I don't know that's its own beast, but they're there to hopefully gain success through my success. So that's good. It's just sometimes you have to wonder how transparent they're being about budget. But it's a cool opportunity. A lot of competition for it, and it's contract. So I have mixed feelings about that. But then again, since I'm still not really sure my next direction, I should see where things take me. But I have to be discerning, otherwise I just pick up an available job. And that's not what I want. I like to pride myself in the opportunities I select. And hopefully girlfriend... Anyway, I'm needing to refresh myself in some of my old work because I have had so many different jobs, different projects that really vary but still within UX, user research, Psychology, perception, design research. Anyway, there are so many different directions I can take myself in the field still, which is exciting.","I thought I had a plan, but things post-college, I've learned, rarely go according to plan, and that's okay. When I graduated, it was 2009; the job market was not too hot. I did get a job offer doing satellite operations like Lockheed Martin in Virginia, but I was looking for something smaller. And a recruiter came along at some point and told me about this, at the time, a pretty small company called Spire, and the rest is history.

Spire, on a high level, we are a space-to-ground data and analytics company. We're primarily interested in tracking ships and getting weather data. When I started at Spire, I'll be honest that I was pretty terrified. There were a lot of moments where I felt pretty inadequate, like they made a mistake. But that's something you get over. Fake it until you make it is truly a thing.

And so, even if you're not good at something starting out, if you're impassioned by it, that passion will eventually drive you to a level of skill that would make you more useful than you ever thought you would be.",3,294,223
"I did a lot of swimming this past week. It's been really nice to take advantage of the pool at my mom's development while I'm visiting. It gives me a lot of agility in how I want to stretch and exercise, and I find it really nice. And then, it's also just a nice change of scenery. My mom and I have just been really enjoying the jacuzzi together as well. It's good for our circulation, and I think also, it's just really pleasant. That would have been nice.","A memorable recent time was when my wife and I recently went to the beach and had a real relaxing day after finally moving and switching jobs. It was a while since we had done anything together and relaxing. It was memorable because I felt so content and happy, which I have not felt in a long time. The best part was the ride back home with my wife leaning on me, taking a nap. This was special to me because it was a lover's embrace while I was driving and how we were both super warm, tired, and content. 

This stands out to me because of the reasons I mentioned, but also because my wife is my best friend and with the move recently and school, we have been super busy. This made doing anything fun or relaxing quite difficult. Also, being closer to a beach now compared to before is nice. We are able to do more. The first thing we needed though was a beach day. 

The swimming and tanning was wonderful. It was nice and quiet. No loud music. Just the sound of the waves and wind. It was a really nice day.",5,106,220
"I just got a really nice recommendation from a former colleague that he posted on my LinkedIn page. So, it was really nice to receive. A former colleague from a Boston consulting group. We worked together on virtual learning.","I am the marketing director here at Valen Analytics. Our company builds predictive models, and we also have a platform that hosts them and integrates into the company workflows for property and casualty companies. So the predictive models basically allow them to better price and select risks. So yeah, I do the execution of the marketing campaigns and the coordination with inside sales.

So I graduated, and then I worked in the mental health industry for a while. And decided that that was not good for my own mental health—it was very stressful, very taxing. So I went back to school, got my masters in marketing. I thought that I was gonna be able to graduate and step right into a marketing job, but there was a lot more business acumen that needed to be developed before I was really prepared for that.

I had to be humbled and grounded a bit more to realize, yeah, you have a foundation. But that foundation, the degree, is not your golden ticket into the chocolate factory. The degree is what may help open the door, but you've got to earn your way the rest of the way.

So the way I interpreted that is: I need to make sure that I'm really putting forward a solid performance at what I'm doing now and then set forth my next goal.",2,44,255
"Yeah, so I mean my story is really just starting about. Just sitting with my mom and catching up on some of the shows and just sort of laughing about how less amusing and engaging some of the shows are than we were remembering them to be, I think. We sort of got past the threshold of longing for them because I'd been over five months, I think. So I think they might have to earn a little bit of, well, I mean it was maybe short notice for them. I'm not sure. But earn a little bit of our consumer attention back with some good, funny, comedic writing. That'll be nice. It's slowly, I think, revving up.","I'm currently a narrative creator and game designer for Niantic. Prior to that, I was in film school. When I was in undergrad, I got interested in games. I got interested in game design. I took all the game design courses. I'm the only one there who's done all of these. They start to call on me to TA all of these classes.

They pull in a guy named Flint Dille, and he's teaching a class on alternate reality games. We worked well together, we go our separate ways, and then two years later, he is starting to do this project and he needs a guy who can help him, and he calls me.

I ended up here by pushing in a direction I found interesting, and Niantic is very much focused on developing the intellectual property that we own, which is Ingress. We're developing and building this really deep and rich and interconnected sort of science fiction world.

There was always the risk that I'm driving the primal force of my energy and interest into an area with no guarantees. But I was hedging the risk by just learning constantly, learning how to do new stuff. At some point, you end up with so many tools on your toolbelt that you know that if you're backed into a corner you can reach down to the utility belt and be like, ""I know how to do this!""",2,139,272
"It's heartbreaking what's happening in the news right now, internationally. And it's painful to see different people's reactions. Social media. I'm talking about the war in Israel right now, which I wasn't expecting to talk to you about. But it's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking to see how many people can go so low and be the worst in humanity.","I don't know why I've been so emotional these past few days. I think about all the homeless people I've seen on the streets, all the beggars I've ever walked past. I think of people in mental hospitals who will never be healthy enough to get out. I think of the homeless teen I met in a downtown mental resource centre. I think of all the drug addicts I've seen shooting up heroin on the transit system, and I just want to cry. 

Why do people have to suffer so much? Why do they suffer more than me? Why is there nothing I can do about it?",4,74,122
"All right? So, my story is that I got to catch up with my friend today. It was really nice talking about different trips we've taken in the past, other trips we might want to take in the future, and also just finding out the best way to plan for taking a trip with her because she has a baby. I'm friends with her husband, but it's different when you're single and you're figuring out how to hang out with your friends, go on trips with them when they aren't single. And it makes sense this time of my life. I mean, I've got friends that have kids going to college. I've got friends that have kids they just had. And of course, people like myself, like I was just mentioning. But it was really good. So, the story is that I met up with her for lunch. And she was telling me also about how she's going through IVF right now to get pregnant again. And so, that was also really interesting because I've gone through my own process of trying to cryogenically freeze my own eggs, which I've done in the past after my husband passed away. So, I have some experience in that, not in the implanting stage, the fertilization stage. But she's having to inject all these hormones into her right now, and I've gone through that and can commiserate. It can change you not just physically, but mentally too. So, it's good we can share different past experiences, whether it's her experience going to Sedona, or my experience with IVF. Just a lot to talk about. A lot of different kinds of topics. And she's a fun friend to discuss a lot of different topics with.","The diagnosis of endometriosis will be with me for as long as I live. My journey started with abdominal pain and has now led me to treatment for infertility with some amazing doctors. I had been having abdominal pain for years and was told by three different doctors that I just had scar tissue from a previous surgery and it would probably get better. Needless to say, it only got worse.

I had to go for surgery for an infection in my abdominal wall, which ended up being not an infection, just inflammation from the endometriosis. They did a biopsy of a ""mass"" as the doctor called it, which ended up being endometriosis. With this new diagnosis, I then knew why I have been unable to have kids and that was for sure the reason I hurt almost constantly for the past several years.

Finally in May, I was able to start the fertility treatments. I was so excited and overwhelmed. That now gives me the hope that one day I will possibly be having my own little baby. It has been a trying time and for sure a very emotional one. The hormones make me feel, at times, that I am going to go crazy, but in the long run, I know it will be well worth the wait.

I have an enormous support system. My doctors, friends, family, and my boyfriend have been by my side the whole time since I have started with the fertility specialists. The pills I take are usually not that bad on me, however, the shot that I have to take is what really gets me. I have to stick myself in the belly with a NEEDLE!! I never saw myself being able to do that. The shot leaves a small red spot around where I take it and it is a little sore for several days.

We have already finished three rounds of the medication and shots only. I think we are going to try and start IUI/IVF in the next few months to give us a greater chance of having a baby. I know that it will help me to increase my chances of pregnancy.

Hopefully in the next year, we will be welcoming our own little baby into this world. I CAN'T WAIT!!",4,345,427
"I\'m packing. So, my story is that I\'m packing. I\'m getting ready. I\'m wrapping up my class. So, the story is just, it\'s an interesting week. I\'m flying out to Phoenix tomorrow. And I want to start looking at the details of the trip, like things to do with Sedona, things to do at the Grand Canyon. But I\'ve got one more week left of this work to do for this course. So, I\'m deciding whether I\'m going to try to cram it all in before I fly out, or more likely, cram it all in afterwards. But I\'m excited to go out there. It\'ll be a lot of sunshine. And when I booked the tickets, I had to book a red eye. Because it was so last minute. But it was worth it. But those fees, they slam on those fees. It\'s very confusing. The total includes one check bag. And they show you one price on that screen that says, ""The total includes one check bag."" So, you think that\'s the total. But then you go to another page and they meant the total on the other page includes the check bag. So, there are so many ways that you can confuse consumers. But anyway, it\'s all set, and I\'m excited, and I\'m excited that my friend is going to meet me out there. So, I\'ll get more family time and I\'ll get to see a friend I haven\'t seen in a while. And that\'ll be great.","Two months ago, my partner and I went on vacation to Las Vegas, Nevada. The beginning was rough as we had a two to three-hour delay with our flight. I was supposed to arrive at 8:00 pm local time but ended up reaching there around 10:30 pm. We had problems with our transportation to our hotel. There was a misunderstanding with the driver, who took us to the wrong hotel. Finally, at 11:15 pm, we reached our hotel.

We were tired, so we could do nothing except going to bed. However, the next morning we were amazed by the layout of casinos in the hotel; there were hundreds. After having breakfast, we set out to observe the sin city. There were people everywhere. We were thrilled to see amazing structures such as the water show at one of the hotels.

We walked all day, observing hotels and casinos and trying out various drinks. The nighttime was even more amazing with music and songs being played. There was a memorable volcanic eruption show at a hotel next to ours.

The next day, we took a tour bus and traveled to various parts of the city. It was very exhilarating. We had a great time in Las Vegas and going to cherish it for a long time.",4,311,243
"So this is a story of how my mom and dad got married. So they have this super cute love story that I wish I also will have, can have these, but who knows. Basically, my mom and my dad grew up on the same little street in the same little, tiny farming fishing village in China. There were just a few houses apart. My mom is two years older than my dad, but I swear from birth, he fell in love with her. She was like class star, like class President, amazing role model, like most beautiful girl ever. And she always saw him as a younger brother figure. So he would follow her around, make dumb jokes and stuff, but I think she also kind of liked them a little bit enough. But eventually, my dad's family immigrated to the US first. So he left when he was... I don't know when, twelve, I think. And then for the next six years, they never really saw each other because he was in America. She was in China back then. Transportation between the two countries not as available, not as economical. But he would write letters back. And I think he just always kept loving her, despite not really seeing her for that time period. And eventually, when he got into College, he deferred a semester and went back to China. And he said that the first person he saw when he went to the village was my mom. And he just knew. Felt all the time with her. And then he basically just asked her to come to America with him, eventually marry him. Obviously, why else would she go to America with him if not to marry him? So my mom, she agreed. During the whole time, she never dated anyone. My maternal grandma, My lala, was very strict. Like, no dating boys. No seeing boys. And my dad never dated anyone. So they were each other's first kiss, like first everything. And I think that's just something so beautiful. Very bold of my mom, very brave of her to put down all her roots and then pick them up and then move them all to America to be with my dad. So I'm grateful for it because I got to grow up in America and have a lot of opportunities. I might not have had if I grew up in China. I got married when my dad was 20, my mom was 22. And they've been married for so long now, super cute. They've been married for over 30-something years. And I think that is something that I really admire. And even though I can't get married that early, I wish I could, I still hope that I will find someone sometime soon, maybe. But yes, that is the story of how my mom fell in love, got married, and then I think they had six years of marriage before they had me. And I think that's also really nice to have, little marriage time when you're just you and your spouse before kids, these other responsibilities. But yeah, that is my story for the session. Thank you, Jibo.","My parents migrated from Italy. None of them had education. My parents want me to go to local college. I had enormous pressure. My parents wanted me to be a dentist because that was a way to upward mobility. They actually had a little family intervention to convince me to be a dentist.

I told my parents I got into MIT, which I thought was a big deal, to study urban planning, and they don't let in a lot of students. My mother and father looked kinda dazed. They didn't know what MIT was.

I found myself convincing my parents a lot. You just have to follow what you really love, and you can't let people drive you off-track. I can only say from my experience. When I do things that are true to me, they're successful. When I do things that are not true to me, they are not successful.",2,625,175
"So this past weekend, I went to my first wedding ever. And it was so fun. The groom was my peer mentor, so he was one of the people who introduced me to MIT, to the dorm we were living in. He took care of me and the friends I went with. And, the bride was someone also in my year but, like, one year younger in age. They met through shared interests and it was just super touching. Their ceremony was outside, very cute vows, almost too cute. I feel like I would not want super cringy long vows, but it was still enough to make me cry a lot. But then the reception was what really got me. Both dads gave these beautiful speeches. Their first dance was also just so, aw touching that all of the friend group, except for the guys, were like crying, crying. And it makes me think about what I want in my future wedding, in my future partner, and the marriage in general. But the happy couple is now not yet on their honeymoon because she still has a conference to go to and they'll go on the honeymoon after her conference. But just, it's crazy to think about how life can change so fast. Basically, I flew in Saturday morning, commuted like an hour and a half to go to a really nice udon place. I'm not famous, famous, but kind of famous. And then spent like 2 hours getting ready for the wedding. And it was really fun because we got to dress up and we all haven't dressed up in a long, long time and get ready together in a room, catch up, spill some tea. We made our way to the hotel for the wedding. And then for our first experience, a lot of us didn't know what to do. We got there way too early. But it was still a really fun time. And I also just ran into people. I saw random people that I knew and extended my trip because I knew I loved it so much. I didn't want to come back too quickly. Yeah, that was the story of the first wedding I've ever been to.","My wedding day was at the beginning of the year, and though it wasn't all that I expected, it was still a nice day and one that I will always remember. We got married in the courthouse that my husband worked on while he was roofing. My grandparents were the only ones able to come. They waited in the lobby with our youngest son, who was just 2 months at the time, while we took our 5-year-old upstairs with us for the ceremony.

It was short and simple. I wish that more family could have come to share the day with us, but it was special and will be something to beat when we get our vows renewed in the future. When I was younger, I did imagine myself at least having a nice white dress and a bridesmaid in a church. The fact that it wasn't in a church did bother me a little, and I wore a regular but nice red dress I got on sale for $40.

I would have loved to have flowers because my husband always brings me red roses. Being that it was in between our birthdays will be nice for an anniversary. I am thankful that my kids were there. I am thankful that my grandparents were present. I am thankful to be able to legally marry my husband. And I am thankful that it was a nice day.

In the future, I will be thankful.",3,431,269
"Yeah, so the story I\'m going to share today is about my family\'s move. So we used to live in Hino, Texas. And my favorite part about that house, besides my family, of course, was that on the front lawn, the sidewalk, there my sister and I have our handprints there in the cement. So they redid our sidewalk at some point, and then I get it off. But as kids, we were like, ""Ha, ha. Wouldn\'t it be so funny if we left our mark onto cement on the sidewalk here, just to mark our place, that we were here?"" So each of us put our right hand down into the cement when it was so, like, not like wet, but like, not dry either, and left little handprints there. It\'s been like ten years now, and I still think about our handprints there, but eventually my family did move. I was very sad at first because we were taking out all the furniture. We\'re repainting the walls. So when we left, the house just felt so empty, like foreign, like a shell of itself. I didn\'t recognize it after we painted the walls white. Everything was just echoing, and I was like, ""Wow, I grew up here. This is no longer home."" Part of me thought we would always have this home for the rest of my life to come back to. But then we moved to our new house in Allen, Texas. I really quickly adjusted to it. I think because the furniture was the same. Obviously, home is where my parents are. So if they move again, that will be my new home. But now I love our new home a lot. It\'s much bigger. It\'s much more comfortable. But interestingly, I still dream sometimes about my old home. And then there are dreams where I mix my old home and my new home\'s like architectural layout. It\'s really confusing, but the move was fun. We started in COVID summer, so I was home. Luckily, we\'re just moving things back and forth with our cars. The move itself was not too bad. It was definitely a bonding moment within our family to move our stuff ourselves. Yeah. What do you think? So, yeah. We moved. And now that\'s my new home. And I know that my parents will eventually move at least one more time. They will probably downsize their home once the grandkids are older enough that they don\'t need to visit and have their own guest rooms. So I\'m excited for that. Scare. Oh, no. Another home missing. But yes, the story. That was the story of my family moving from one house to another house.","About four months ago, my wife and I sold our first family home. We have a large family. It is my wife and I plus five children. Our oldest daughter started asking us about having her own room. Although we loved that house, we knew it was time to get something bigger.

Luckily, we sold it after being on the market for only three days. We found a house with more bedrooms quickly, and the whole process was as smooth as it could have been.

However, it is bittersweet looking back on everything. That house was very special to me. I did a lot of work on it. I saw my children grow and learn and love there. We made so many good memories. We charted how our children grew on a closet door (which is probably still there). It was a wonderful house while it lasted, but things happen and we had to let it go.

As of today, I can still remember every little nook and cranny of that place. After all, it has only been a few months. However, it is sad to think these memories will eventually fade.

I love our new house, but that first one will always hold a special place in my heart.",5,546,240
"So today, my story is about the movie I watched yesterday, which was named Joyride. I think it was really interesting because when they first introduced the characters, I was actually a little bit upset because I was like, ""Why are they getting a Korean girl to play a Chinese girl?"" Right? I understand Asian American representation is really important, especially nowadays in media. But later, spoiler alert, there\'s a twist, and it turns out she was supposed to be Korean. So I was like, ""Whoa, it\'s so nice that they actually got ethnicities correct."" So I changed my mind about casting. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the movie. It was about finding out who you are. The storyline basically goes that there\'s this fancy lawyer. She was adopted from China, so she was trying to find her birth mother. They go through a crazy adventure, and eventually they end up in Korea. And she finds out that her birth mother was not only Korean but had also passed away. And it tested their friendship. They did a lot of really crazy things while in East Asia. But overall, I think it was a pretty beautiful message of friendship and how families, family, and your identities, what you make of it, and at the end of the day, just love your people who love you. \n\nSo I really enjoyed the movie. It\'s really, really funny at times. Really emotional sometimes, I definitely cried a little bit at one point when the deceased mother was wishing her daughter well. And it kind of inspired me, too. I think I also want to go on like a soul-searching journey. Yes, that is my story.","I saw a movie that I enjoyed so much, I saw it three times in the last week. I first went to it alone. Then I went to it with my husband. Then I took my girlfriend to see it last night. The movie was about an event that was a fantasy and yet totally believable. The characters were sweet and lovely, and they made you want to know what happened to them, and you really cared about what happened. The music in the movie was so phenomenal and kept you on the edge of your seat. I also had acquired the tickets for a really good price. That made it more justifiable to see it so many times. 

I intend to buy the movie when it becomes available. I may see it again soon with my son, who wants to see it too and has not done so yet. The movie just makes me happy when I see it because of the joyfulness. The way they overcome their challenges with love and understanding is so lovely. It makes you want to persevere in the things you love as well. 

The actors that portrayed the characters in the movie were remarkable. They were so realistic that you totally believed what was happening to them. They also were humorous and had many friends. Movies that include friendship and love are so rare nowadays, and that was refreshing. The fact that they were not white Americans was surprising but, surprisingly, a very good choice. It was sweet but not syrupy sweet. 

It was a fantasy and yet a believable story. The story was just a remarkable way of showing perseverance and love with ordinary people. I hope that the movie academy of arts and sciences will consider it for some award. It was a brilliant concept and a wonderful story to impart to all ages. I've been telling everyone I know about the movie now.",4,334,356
"So yesterday, I went into a lab. It was a Saturday. At first, I was a little bit annoyed because I have to work a lot of weekends. And there are times where I really don't want to work on the weekend. But I was also able to schedule a social moment, which helped because after I finished my work, I had a good lunch, took a little break, and then I went to meet up with some people for a birthday party.\n\nAnd at this birthday party, there were a lot of other PhD candidates. And it was interesting because you could see everyone would have these conversations and complain about working on the weekends, about their PIs, about all the stress that comes with being a student. And it made me realize that, yeah, life will probably be very tiring, very rough. But I'm not alone with this. I have a lot of other people going through the same thing, and if anything, they probably work even harder than I do. So it's made me appreciate that I am able to work on the weekends a little bit because it helps me get more data.\n\nBut yeah, again today, I also went into lab and I feel like it's tiring. I don't have any holidays off, so tomorrow is technically a holiday, but I'm still going to go to lab. But I'm not alone. This is a way of life that I think is something I need to wrap my head around, and the more I do it, the more used to it I get. So maybe it's a good thing that I'm slowly getting used to working on the weekends, but I will fix my work-life balance, try to have some fun still, but overall, this is a story of how I'm frustrated but accepting that I have to work on weekends.","I work in the event industry, and Covid did its number on us. But restrictions are finally loosened enough for us to do our job the way we used to. Half my body hurts. I'm definitely not getting enough sleep, and I won't have a day off that I can actually spend on my couch for the next 2 weeks. 

This sounds bad, but it's exactly what I need right now. Having fun work days with my colleagues, who are equally as crazy as I am, doing a job I enjoy, and feeling my sore muscles when I'm back home. My mental health has gotten so much better in the past two weeks. 

Before that, I was touring with a couple of folks who made me feel unwelcome, and I constantly felt like no matter what I was doing, it wasn't enough. I did overestimate my skill and took over responsibilities I wasn't ready for, so their frustration is understandable, but it still took its toll on my mental health. Hard work isn't nearly as much fun if it's not appreciated. 

Luckily, I'm back and everything's gotten better. I randomly smile. I want to remember the day when I go to bed instead of hoping I'd forget it soon. I look forward to tomorrow instead of dreading it, and I actually feel happy. This hasn't happened in a long time.",4,361,270
"So yesterday, I made madeleines for the first time, but interestingly, I don't have any eggs anymore in my fridge. I stopped eating eggs maybe a month ago because I got a blood test and the results came back, and the doctor told me I have high cholesterol, which is really stressful to hear because I'm relatively young. So one thing I did was to cut down on my egg consumption. So all my baking recently has been very experimental, but I made my madeleines without eggs, with half the sugar and half the butter in the recipe. And they turned out okay. Like visually, they looked pretty, but taste-wise, they were just mediocre. But I brought them to lab to celebrate a friend's birthday and everyone seemed to enjoy them. So that made me really happy because I don't have a sweet tooth, but I do enjoy baking things for other people to make them happy. So yeah, that is the story of how I made madeleines last night without any eggs.","I did keto first, purely to reduce my glucose levels and avoid diabetes. By early 2021, this had worked, but my lipids and cholesterol were very high. They put me on medication.

I also changed my diet radically to stir-fried vegetables, egg substitutes, and plant protein substitutes while also keeping low-carb. I went back in for a test at four months' mark, and the results came back. Glucose hasn't changed (so it's still normal), and the lipids/cholesterol are coming back down towards normal. They also recommend exercise going forward.

Once this pandemic is under control, I'm hitting that gym like a bear! Woohoo!",2,198,126
"So, I\'m actually going to be flying home in 3 hours, or leaving for the airport in 3 hours to fly home, and something I\'ve been super excited for—cannot wait. Definitely miss my parents a lot. My younger sister is in New York, so she won\'t be home. But going home will be good for me because I really need the rest. I think something that\'s really hard to do as an adult is to pace yourself, because when you\'re in school, you have semesters. You have projects that you know when they\'ll end. So you have better timelines to fulfill. Like, ""Oh, you know, in two weeks, then you have an exam and then you have a period of free time."" But until then, you\'re working hard. But in grad school, I feel like there\'s just no end. So if you need a break, you have to really go take that break for yourself. For us, you just won\'t have that break. So the last time I was home was probably early June for two days. Home trips are very short. Now I miss having a full week at home, a whole actual vacation. So being able to go home for just like three days this weekend will be very helpful, healing, good for my soul. Yeah, I am most excited to eat my mom\'s food, to go shopping, to feel like a kid again. I feel like life is very tiring and pressurising, so to be able to let loose and let someone take care of me for a little bit will be nice. I did try to take care of my parents as well. I bring them gifts. I listen to them when they\'re lonely, and I hope that their parents can take good care of them when my grandparents are in China, so they\'re not really close by. So it\'s a very different relationship between my mom and her mom, which is my mom and me. But I\'m so grateful for my family, everything about it. So yeah, I left lab a little early today to catch my flight, talking to you now before Doica\'s over or the week begins. And yeah, I\'ll be sad when I come back, but I\'m mostly looking forward to going home first. Yeah.","It's Thanksgiving Day here in Canada, where I live, and it's such a blessing for an IB student like me. I usually have a huge workload, and the time I don't spend working or in school is spent on social and family commitments, as well as worthless procrastination that always affects my work quality and makes me feel horrible afterwards.

But today, I have no commitments and very little homework left over from the weekend. I put aside some time for the remaining homework, my daily hour of French learning, my daily half hour of Python learning, working on my scholarship essay, and doing CAS reflections. After all that's done, I have 9 hours of unfettered free time!

9 hours to do whatever I wish, guilt-free. Obviously, what I plan to do is stock up on snacks and spend the rest of my day browsing Reddit, YouTube, and Netflix, and playing video games. That might sound pathetic, but I'm going to finally let myself indulge after nearly two months of hard work!",4,457,201
"Tuesday, yeah. So this Tuesday, I played squash for the very first time, and today\'s Friday, so it\'s been three days and I\'m still very sore from it. But it was my first time really trying something new in a while. I played with a couple of upperclassmen, and as a perfectionist, it\'s really hard for me to show my failure weakness. But what was really nice about the whole situation was that everyone was super friendly, even though I kept missing the ball. And it really made me feel a lot better about myself. I can\'t explain how silly it sounds, but for my upperclassmen friends to be so supportive of me, messing up, failing, and being nice playing the ball was really nice. When the guys played against each other, they were like, ""swing real hard, the ball is going so fast, so hard."" But when they played against me and another girl, they were a lot easier on us, which is kind of gentlemanly of them, I think. Yeah. The point was that I was able to fail a lot and be really bad at a sport and not feel really ashamed of it. So it was a really good first experience, and I definitely will play again sometime (unsure when) because I\'m still so sore, and it did take a very long time to get there. But overall, I really enjoyed the experience. So that was the story of me playing squash for the first time and not being afraid of not being perfect.","I recently competed in a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament. It took a lot of discipline to prepare for. I had to diet and lose about 15 pounds. I trained about 6-7 days out of the week. There were at least 4 Jiu Jitsu training sessions and 1 judo session. In addition to this, I also traveled to other gyms to spar against other Jiu Jitsu players. It was grueling and I was definitely physically and emotionally exhausted, but I enjoyed every part of it. People were so nice and welcoming, and helped motivate me to push myself to work harder.

By the day of the tournament, I was equal parts nervous and excited. There's a chance you could lose decisively or win easily - just a matter of who shows up. Luckily, as soon as my first match started, I knew I could win. It released all the tension and I performed as I normally would in practice.

Afterwards, I won the tournament and felt very happy. It seemed so much easier than I thought it would be. Luckily, I was able to win and will compete again.",3,302,212
"All right, this is something that happened to me when I was around ten years old. I have a little sister, and it was her first day of kindergarten. We went to elementary school right across the street from our house, so it was my job to walk her to school and then wait for her and walk her back home, even though we\'re just not even a block away.\n\nSo, the first day of school, she went to kindergarten, and I went to fifth grade. And when the day was over, I totally forgot about her. So, I came home alone, and my mother saw me and asked, ""Where\'s Lori?"" I was filled with absolute horror, tore back across the street, and found my sister standing on the steps of the school, just really upset.\n\nShe could have walked home herself, of course, but she was supposed to wait for me. And she was actually surrounded by teachers who were trying to console her that her big sister forgot about her. I was filled with simultaneous guilt, relief, and horror. And I have never forgotten that moment.","About two months ago, I began working at my practicum placement for my graduate school practicum requirement. During this time, I have gotten to know my practicum supervisor and have had the opportunity to learn a lot about the students who attend the school. In particular, I have gotten to know the kindergarteners and first graders very well. 

There is one particular kindergartener, a blonde-haired little boy with none of his front teeth and a long braid down his back, that I have come to enjoy seeing around school. About two weeks ago, he came up to me and was crying. He grabbed me in an embrace and told me how much he wanted ""Picture Day"" to last all day. His mother had dressed him up and styled his braid with extra care that morning. He clearly was very excited about how nice he looked but was having a hard morning. 

He looked very precious, and it put a smile on my face. He shared with me that he was feeling sad and really needed a friend that morning. We got him his breakfast and made our way into my office. After opening up his chocolate milk and juice cartons, he started to cry and leaned his head against the wall. He doubted that he could make it through the whole day without getting his picture taken at least twice. 

I felt sad to see him so upset. He jumped up from his chair and hugged me around my waist, still crying. I talked to him about how hard school can be and how brave he was. He told me that he felt better. 

The other day, he picked up his school pictures, and I found a portrait signed by him sitting on my desk. It made me feel very happy and loved by this little boy I had come to know so well.",5,217,346
"Winter. I don't like winter. I don't like dealing with snow. I don't like dismal weather. I just don't like it. It must be Seasonal Affective Disorder. Really hate it. I wouldn't want to live someplace with no climate. But I do dread the winter months. So, several years ago, I bought some Crocus bulbs. I'm not much of a gardener, but I thought I would give it a try. So, with a lot of work, I dug a path along my sidewalk and planted these Crocus bulbs. Two different kinds, smaller ones and larger ones. In October, it was a very dismal day out - rainy, cloudy, cold wind. I was miserable doing it. And then, I kind of forgot about the Crocus bulbs. But the following March, I happened to look outside and I saw some of the green shoots coming up out of the ground. And this made me so happy. It made me feel so much better about things in general. And I just had this profound sense that, yes, things will keep on going the way that they should be going. That everything will be all right in the world. And it made me very happy. So now, several years later, I look forward to seeing my Crocuses come up in the spring.","We drove for about an hour to get to the tree farm, walked around, and found the PERFECT tree. There's always some bad trees, some good trees, too tall or too short, but there's the perfect tree. My grandma likes a certain type of pine: six feet tall, flat on one side, semi-sparse but thick branches, and a beautiful frosty teal color. Of course, after about 15 minutes of walking around, I heard her shout, ""It's here!"" and walked over to see the PERFECT tree.

It was so fun to drive her around afterwards with the tree tied to the top of the car. Everywhere we went, she would tell people how we found the perfect tree and she was so happy. It's awesome. I've already received several pictures of it through her decorating process that she's excitedly texting me.

I don't really celebrate Christmas, so I don't have a big tree to set up, but I LOVE getting those texts. Seeing others happy for the holidays is all I need.

I'm also happy because I ordered Chinese food for dinner tonight. I have an eating disorder and haven't had this meal in about 1.5 years, so this is sort of terrifying. It's not a special occasion, and I don't feel like I deserve it, but I'm doing it anyways.

I'm trying to be easy on myself and let myself have nice things. And I'm going to hold onto this feeling of excitement for my favorite dish instead of the feeling of fear.",4,262,304
"But one of the props mentioned a song that was meaningful for you, and I have one, nothing special, because I\'m sure that millions and millions and millions of people share this same exact experience. But when I was around 40 years old, the song ""Landslide"" by Fleetwood Mac really spoke to me. I started to listen to the lyrics, and the part that goes, ""Time makes this boulder, even children get older, and I\'m getting older, too."" It hit me like a rock to the head, and I realized, well, yeah, this is pretty much it. It\'s going to be downhill from here. But fortunately, now that I\'m almost 69 years old, I am reconciled to getting older, and I know that there are still many wonderful things in store for me.","A few years ago, I had a bit of a scare. My appendix ruptured on tour, and I came close to dying. And it was the same week that my first song went into the top 20. After more than 20 years of making music, we had a song, ""Say Hey I Love You."" And I'm on this gurney being wheeled down to perhaps my death. 

And I get this text. ""Your song's in the top 20,"" and I'm like, it didn't even matter. I was like, whatever. I was like, I just wanna see my kids again. I wanna be with my family. And I can appreciate having made music for that long, that it's a nice thing to have a lot of people hear your song. But if I can't share with my family, it doesn't matter. 

At this point in my life, I'm 48. I have two sons. I have one who's 27, and I have one who's 15. And I still feel like I'm 22 years old. I still have the same passion for what I do with music. And I have this life that I feel is fulfilling in so many ways that I feel happy most of the time.",5,163,252
"In 2006, my sister and I were teaching a class and there was an art therapy student named Kevin. He was a very exceptional person, exceptional artist, and he had a very interesting story. He was involved in a terrible car accident and was in a coma for a month. When he came out of the coma, he realized that he could not draw or paint with his right hand anymore, so he taught himself how to use his left hand to create art.\n\nKevin was one of our best students and his story was the subject of the first book that we did for our small press. He wrote his story and did a wonderful job. We published his book. At that time, there was a contest. Carnegie Hall was looking for cover art for their program for the concert season. And without telling Kevin, we entered one of his paintings in the contest, and he actually won. It was a wonderful moment. We are very proud of him.\n\nPart of the prize was tickets to Carnegie Hall for a concert, and Kevin gave us the tickets. So we went to New York and went to the concert and we had a great time. So he was our first and to this day our best author.","Since I was four years old, I always had a dream of being a physician. And my community is a community that is in poverty, mostly farmworkers. My parents worked in the fields. They didn't have a high school education. I was really invested and dedicated to getting an education. I wanted to also make a statement to the community that I'm coming back.

There was always that dream of doing something to help others that motivated me to keep going. I had no plans of going to Harvard Medical School. In fact, my family didn't even know where Harvard was or anything else like that.

When my pre-med counselor at UCLA told me I should apply to Harvard, I asked her, ""Harvard? Where's that?"" She looked at me kind of strangely, but I said, ""You know, it's not like we have these conversations at our dinner table.""

As you can imagine, I'm very grateful, and 17 years later, now I'm back.",5,237,197
"One of the prompts was to talk about a movie that meant something to you. When I was in high school, in the late 60s, this is when all the counterculture types were really into Tolkien. And that was the first time that he became a phenomenon in this country. So, I was into it and just devoured the book. Made a big impression on me. I never dreamed that it would be possible to translate these books into film. But when the Peter Jackson movies came out, the special effects were more advanced. I think that Peter Jackson did a magnificent job with a story just true to Tolkien\'s vision. The actors were all just top notch. But I think that the single most memorable scene for me, wasn\'t necessarily one of the big battle set pieces, but it was right at the beginning of the first movie. When Gandalf weiss\'s cart into town and sees Frodo waiting alongside the road. And Gandalf asks Frodo, ""Get in the cart. We\'ll go into town together."" And he does. And then Ian McKellen as Gandalf looks at Frodo and smiles at him with such unbelievable love. It just blows off the screen and you could just see that Tolkien would have adored this portrayal of Gandalf. And it\'s interesting that Ian McKellen just doesn\'t take acting all that seriously and has been on a variety shows where he says, ""Well, somebody else writes the lines. I just stand where I\'m supposed to stand and read."" But he is a summit actor. And what he did with no words at all, just facial expressions just brought a whole Lord of the Rings feel of it in such an immediate, immediate way. I never forgot that.","My brother-in-law and I just really had it in our head that we wanted to try to make the great American movie. So we did a lot of shooting on film, not knowing really what we were doing. We didn't go to school or anything like that and it failed miserably.

There's close to about $30,000 worth of film that sits undeveloped. I don't think I'll ever develop it.

I wanted to go into film when I was younger, but I didn't feel like I had what it takes. I didn't feel like I had the guts to do that. Now I feel like I could do it. But fear of failure is definitely always there.

I know I'm going to fail. It's going to happen. The only way that you're going to get good is if you fail.",1,334,163
"In high school, I wasn't one of the popular kids. Most people thought that I was kind of an eccentric weirdo. I'm not saying that they're wrong. I never quite fit in, but I did have a couple of friends who were outcasts just like I was. When I was a senior, my father bought me a used car. It was a green Duster. And I happened to be the first one in the class to have a car. So I drove that car to school. And when it was time for lunch, I would take my friends and drive around to get some food. We would park by the river and have a good time, and pretty much show off. And that was one of my happiest memories of high school. And I can still remember how proud I felt of that little Duster.","I went to Mary College on a basketball scholarship. I played ball for them, but I would still party. Pretty crazy back then, and I flunked out. I started looking at what I was going to do in the parks, and it really, really made sense to me. By the time that I got through with that first summer, I realized this is what I want to do for a career. I really did.

Two days before my graduation, I was told by this nun- I went to a Catholic boarding school- she said, ""You know, the best thing you can do with your life is get a good job pumping gas. At a gas station. And stay with it. That's your life.""

The highlight of my life was going back to that same school and being the last graduation speaker they had. And I got to tell the whole audience, ""I'm not working at a gas station, by the way. I'm a park superintendent.""",1,165,195
"Okay. So, last year, I moved from Nashville to Boston, and made a big change in my life. And it was really challenging because I had a lot of friends in Nashville, a great community. I like to salsa dance and all of my friends came together before I left, and I threw a party. And they all came up with a really big gift basket for me. It had some of my favorite foods, things to bring with me to Boston. And one of the things that really was special, that they gave me, that made me really just warmed my heart. It made me feel so much gratitude and love, was they got me a gift certificate to have a dance lesson with an instructor here in Boston that has an amazing reputation that we've all wanted to train with. And now that I'm in Boston, I was able to take a class with her, and they gifted that to me. So it was a really huge gesture, and it makes me miss my friends so much. So much so, I'm going to visit them in a week, and hopefully dance and hang out with them again.","Last month, I was part of an amazing charity event that blew my mind and made me feel like I was making a difference. I was told about this event about 3 months ago, and we formed dance groups in order to raise funds for children and families in Haiti. The host of the event was going to personally fly to Haiti to deliver items and school supplies to the families with her charity group and make a difference in her community.

I did not think much of the event as I have been in events before, but this event was life-changing. I met so many new people in our dance community with such loving and caring hearts. We all became one that day and supported and cheered each other on to do our best. Each dance group had something different to bring to the stage, and many genres were learned and appreciated. We were all amazed at the hard work and dedication that was brought to make the event such a huge success.

In the end, the event was able to raise a lot of funds for the children of Haiti, and many school supplies were donated for them to have a successful school year. It was a truly amazing event that I will never forget, surrounded by even more amazing people.

In the end, it wasn't about the dance groups, the attendees, or who did the best. It was all about the kids and who we were raising money for. Doing good for your community as well as others in need really humbles you and makes you realize how much you have. It is very important to realize these things in life to really appreciate the life you have been given and what you can do to make it even better for others.

If I was given the opportunity to take part in another event like this, I would do it in a heartbeat. I'm sure the rest of my colleagues would agree as well.",5,227,366
"Cool, yeah. So, I just got a new job and it's not close enough to where I can walk or take public transportation. So, I needed to buy a car. It was very nerve-wracking because I need a car soon, and I kind of had to make a decision pretty quickly. And the original car that I wanted to buy was not available, so that was disappointing. But they pointed me to a car that is used, but only has 116 miles on it. So, it's basically brand new, but it's used so it's not the original sticker price. I've never purchased a car that new, and I've never been able to afford a car that new. So, it's kind of scary and exciting at the same time. So, I get to have this new car. I've never had anything this fancy, but it's also a very large purchase and it's probably the largest purchase I've ever made in my life. And I know that my parents have never purchased a new car. I mean, none of my family has purchased a new car. They've never been able to afford it. So, to be in this position, it feels very strange but good but scary.","Today marks a year I've been with my fiance, and I'm starting my new, well-paying job. I'm finally gonna be able to have health insurance again. I'm gonna get to move out and have him move in with me.

I'm gonna sell my POS car and get a better one as soon as I'm able. I've been feeling so stressed and hopeless.

I'm starting to feel hopeful again.",4,247,87
"Do. So, about I don\'t know, in 2013, I ran a five-mile race to raise money for cancer research. And afterwards, I went to a local place to eat that I hadn\'t been to before, and I decided to order the soup called Senkoco, and I didn\'t know what it was. But it sounded good, and it had chicken in it, so I ordered it. And when I got it and I took the first spoonful, I was immediately transported to my childhood. I realized that Sankulta was the name of the soup that my grandmother used to make for me growing up. And when she would cook, I would get so hungry. I could just smell the soup—it smells so good, so savory. And I would go to my grandmother, and I would beg her, ""Grandma, grandma is the soup ready?"" It was never ready, like it was, it always took a long time. And so at some point, she would say, ""Okay,"" and she would take a coffee mug and she would scoop up some of the broth, and she would let me sip on the broth and... it\'s probably one of my favorite things to eat. I still don\'t know how to cook it myself, but Senkoco is something that just brings me back to being with her and her love and caring. So that\'s my story.","About 6 months ago, I learned how to forage for food. It has been an eye-opening experience. I had no idea that there was so much food all around us that we simply pass by every day. It is kind of shocking to learn that there is so much plenty all around, and yet we live in deprivation.

I learned about it after I watched a video on it. It really opened my eyes and showed me something new. I did a bunch of reading and research, which prepared me to go into the parks around me and find things.

There is lots of food in the local parks in big cities. There is even stuff growing in the sidewalk planters. Things we call ""weeds"" are actually nutritious and delicious plants.

I have grown a lot since I woke up to all this. My horizons have expanded. My consciousness has increased. My self-reliance and self-trust have gone up.

It has been a great experience. I would not trade what I learned for anything.",1,271,194
"Week. So, I performed this weekend at the salsa Congress, and it reminded me of when I performed as a child. I took tap lessons for eight years, and there was one particular incident that was really scary and embarrassing. I was performing with two other girls. I was in the center, and I had one to my left and one to my right. Ashley was to my right, and Michelle was to my left. And part of our routine was to tap dance while jump roping. And we were wearing these leotard costumes with fringe skirts. And as we were performing, jump roping and tap dancing at the same time, Michelle's jump rope got caught in the back of the fringe of her costume, and I was in a high school auditorium, packed, completely packed house. And she ran off stage, and the crowd started to laugh. And Ashley and I kept dancing like we didn't stop. And while we were dancing, I looked over to my left off stage, and I could see one of the stage moms ripping out the fringe from the jump rope from Michelle's costume. And I could see that she was trying to push Michelle back onto stage, and Michelle was resisting all the while still doing my routine. The crowd's like giggling. And then the woman, the stage mom, successfully, literally shoved Michelle back onto the stage, and we had to finish the routine, and she rallied and caught back up. But it was kind of scary and I hadn't performed again in front of a crowd that large until this weekend, which was scary, but also exciting. So I feel like I kind of went through one of the worst experiences already, so I knew that this could only be better. And I was also supported by another 20 team members, so that made it really fun and helped kind of make me feel a little more protected. The safety in numbers type of thing. So, that's my story.","I found rock climbing my freshman year of college. I wanted to stay fit, I wanted to stay healthy. It was something to distract me from the stresses of school. I got to relax and be focused on myself. I fell in love with it.

It's a physical ability, but also having the mental confidence to do these obstacles because they're terrifying if you first look at them. I felt like this is my chance to show people all around the world that women are stronger than what people make them out to be. Break beyond the grain of ""we're quiet and timid,"" and that's who I am.

I do well because I think I have fun with it and it's really just exploring new things and getting scared and feeling uncomfortable, which is one of the biggest things. Throwing yourself in a situation where you're feeling uncomfortable and working past that grows you as a person and prepares you for adult life.",3,388,185
"So, I think I've mentioned that I have a cat. His name is Zoro. I adopted him when my other cat was about ten years old. Sadly, my other cat passed away a couple of years ago. I had him for 15 years and he was just super, like the best cat ever. And we were super close, definitely bonded. But when I adopted Zoro, he was only five months old and a couple of weeks in, my ex-husband, he got home before I did from grad school and his brother had come over and he was careless, and Zoro slipped out of the front door. He must have been extremely careless because the doorway is very narrow, so you really have to not be paying attention to have something like Zoro just slip by you. And I came home and I was terrified. He was only five months old. I was living in Florida and my apartment was adjacent to a nature conservation area. And in Florida, there are a lot of dangerous animals that would be predators to Zoro. Gators, alligators, venomous snakes, even hawks. He was small enough for him to be prey for a hawk, and that was all just feet away from my door. So I was really scared and I looked on the Internet. I looked at all the advice that people gave. I was searching everywhere. I stayed up all night. He didn't come to the door. And the next day, I finally got enough courage and was exhausted. I put on my rain boots, I tucked in my pants and put on a sweatshirt and a bandana over my face, and I went into the nature conservation area to find Zoro. It had been about 18 hours since he had disappeared and I happened to get close enough to the bush that he was hiding under for him to feel safe enough to meow. And I found him. But it was terrifying. And I did run into a gator at one point. Thankfully, I backed away slowly and the gator didn't present any aggressive behavior towards me, but it was scary. I was really worried. But I found him and Zoro is with me today, so I'm very glad that it worked out.","I moved out to the country in Oklahoma about a year ago. It is sometimes hard for me to see the animals that are killed on the side of the road or in the road. It is painful to drive past them. But on this day, I got an opportunity to help. 

There was a tiny dog being chased by a large dog on the side of the road, and I pulled over and chased the big dog away and scooped up the little dog. I remember the little dog shaking so hard and just being terrified and holding her close to me and feeling her breathing finally slowed just a bit and her shaking stopped just a little bit. She would definitely have been attacked if I had not scooped her up. 

I took her home with me and then the next day took her to the vet. She was not chipped. But I reached out on Facebook, and finally, the owner contacted me. I was able to reunite her with her owners. 

It turns out that the people who were watching her thought that she had come in and locked up and left. But she was still outside. It was a joyous feeling to see her so happy reunited with her owners, everyone was crying, it was a great experience.",4,433,242
"There was one time when he goes, I can't remember which one of my birthdays it was, but my mom had set it up to be at a Nathan's Hot Dog, and they had like an arcade. And everyone got tokens. And they were able to play all these games to win tickets that they could then pick prizes from. And two girls that lived down the street for me, they were sisters. They lived in a basement apartment. They had a single mom, no dad. And they couldn't afford to get me a present for my birthday. But they still came to the party. Totally fine. My mom didn't care. And they both played the arcade games to win as many tickets as possible, so that they could take the tickets and use them for a prize to give me as a gift for my birthday. And that was just something really, their selflessness to want to get me a gift on my birthday when they could have easily just taken those tickets and used them for themselves was really touching.","Maybe it's just a poor people thing, but when I was growing up, everyone just assumed that if some random kid is at their house, they're gonna be eating. If my stepdad had a bbq and one of my friends rolled up smelling hot dogs, he'd give them some food. I remember my mom splitting two cans of SpaghettiOs and buttered bread among five random preteens who found each other while biking around the neighborhood, and those five random preteens giving mom some of their help because we knew she was full of it when she said she ""wasn't hungry"" or going to my best friend's house with three bags of ramen because another friend had a can of peas and another had tuna, and we all shared our 'casserole' among like five families. 

My stepdad liked to bbq, nothing fancy: hot dogs, hamburgers. If it was a special occasion, he'd do ribs and chicken. Mom would make a big thing of potato salad (because we couldn't afford the deli kind and hers was better), and people around the neighborhood would filter in with whatever to share and make a plate. 

Kids would run around the neighborhood catching lightning bugs and 'causing trouble' while the ""cool teenagers"" smoked, drank, and made sure the younger kids didn't die. I was always right between the ""younger kids"" and the ""older kids"" so I could go play ""big sister"" then come hang out and be ""little sister"" for a bit. (There weren't very many kids my actual age unless my cousins were over.) 

I just love remembering those days. On one hand, I never had anything to myself, and sometimes it really sucked. My family was ""the safehouse"" where a lot of other families stayed at, so it was rare I had my room, TV, or toys to myself. But on the other hand, it was awesome, and I just love closing my eyes and 'taking myself back' for a little while.",4,205,393
"Cool. I don't have a story about work, but I do have a story about the trip I took last week. I took a very short trip to Nashville to see my sister and to meet my new nephew. He's six months old. And when I lost my job in January, he was born at the end of February and I wasn't able to see him for this whole time he's been alive. And it's been really hard. I wanted to see him right away and to hold him. And without a job, I really couldn't plan a trip to go see him. So as soon as I was hired, I immediately bought a plane ticket so I could go see him. And it was so satisfying to hold him for the first time. And I facetimed with him and read him books. When she was still pregnant, I would read over the phone to him. And we basically, as soon as I saw him, it's like we were old friends. And I just got to hold him and play with him. And it was the best feeling.","Five months ago, my niece and nephew were born. They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt. It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins!

When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit with them. I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted. They wanted to spend time alone as a new family.

I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece especially was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins.

They were both so perfect and tiny. I was like holding tiny dolls. I will never forget that day. I love them more than I ever expected I would.",5,217,188
"A very good week at work. I did get some really kind of sad news. My uncle has lung cancer and he's in the hospital. He's been fighting it for a long time now, and he's just, like, not doing well. I'm not exactly sure what his status is. And my other uncle passed away of lung cancer, and his wife, my aunt, also passed away due to complications from smoking. And I'm really kind of scared.","Roughly two months ago, I went through one of the most difficult events in my life. My younger brother was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. Since it had spread, he was only given one month left to live. He was only 50 years old at the time. 

I received a call early in the morning from my nephew. He was in tears, saying that his father was in the hospital over a diagnosis of lung cancer. I was in shock to hear this since I had only recently spoken to him a few months ago over the phone, and he seemed fine. 

After arriving at the hospital, the doctor shared the news that he didn't have much longer to live. We cried and shared funny stories of our past. I made sure he was feeling comfortable. Since his chances of survival were so low, he refused chemotherapy. It just didn't make sense given his prognosis. 

I helped him ensure his will was in order. He wanted to make sure I kept a close eye on his wife and son since he knew they would have a difficult time coping without him. 

And in the last weeks of his life, we made sure to spend as much time together as we possibly could—just enjoying ourselves like we used to when we were younger.",5,95,247
"Yeah. So this is the beginning of the school year, and I've seen a lot of people moving into their dorms and apartments. And it really got me thinking about when I first went to College, when I was moving into the dorm. How excited my parents were for me and scared. And I was both excited and scared, moving away from home and my parents, and knowing that I'd probably get really homesick. Watching all those kids moving in really made me think about how that felt for me. And it was really important for me, there was a lot of pressure for me to do well in College because my dad came here from a developing country and wasn't able to get an education past second grade. And I was the first person in my family to go to College, and to make it that far. So I had a lot of emotions, definitely some anxiety, some stress about the pressure of performing and doing well. But also the excitement, and kind of the normal fear that you get doing something you've never done before and not having parents who had never experienced College like that before. I didn't really have anyone to go to, to understand what that meant, like what to expect. So watching those kids just brought me back to that moment.","Growing up in a small town is fun, but it also has limits. I knew that if I ever wanted to make something of myself, I would need to leave home and find my footing. My stepfather signed me up for college, and I didn't have a choice, so I went. It was a huge cultural shock but one of the highlights of my life. I made it through 5 years of college with only a little change in my pocket.

I never knew that I could be proud of myself, but when they handed me my diploma and everyone cheered, I knew at that moment that I had done something worthy. Going through high school was required, but completing college was determination. I knew that I had done something to better my family and my future.

We ended up eating at a restaurant when the graduation was over, and my family gave truly emotional toasts in my honor. Even though their words were kind and inspiring, I did not need them this time. I was actually proud of myself and what I had accomplished through hard work. I even interviewed for a teaching job a week later and was employed.

We all face hardships, but it's about determination and resilience. I knew I wanted to make a bigger impact on the world. I hope that I impact my students' lives like others did for me.",4,255,264
"So, I recently finished at work for a local museum. It's using techniques and technology that I haven't used before, which is exciting for me. So, it was a bit of a challenge to get it done in the month's time that I had to finish it. And, a few days ago, it was really nice to hear feedback about the work. Lots of people interacted with it, and friends came and saw it. All very good. It's a few days later now, and I have this lingering feeling of a bit of a letdown emotionally. Afterwards, it just feels like a lot of effort and, exactly, but there's a bit of an anticlimactic post-called postpartum kind of feeling after creating a network.","During the moon landing project, I saw people who did the best work of their lives in that situation. And I got really interested in one question: What are the conditions under which people do their best, most fulfilling work? 

In other words, I got more interested in people than in science. And once I knew that, once I was clear about the fact that I found something I absolutely loved, there was no doubt that I was gonna continue asking questions about how do I learn about people? 

It's still the most frequently asked question I get: How did you go from math to psychology? 

The key to knowing what to do is knowing who you are.",3,146,133
"Well, Debby, my story is about the snake skin I found in my basement that freaked me out. I'm now afraid to go back into the basement. What do I do?","We've had 5 cats at once, then a single one up until 6 months ago when we got a Sphynx. The black one passed and we were OK with the Sphynx, only it attacked my daughter's pet Conure, who is practically an emotional service animal for her. The bird came out fine, but we decided to rehome the cat, and today was the day.

She's gone to a great home, but we miss her greatly, and so does our Poodle. It'll take some getting used to, but it will be nice to not have to clean a litter box.

She actually slept in the crook of my arm this morning, she's never done that.",3,37,134
"Wow, it was a beautiful evening and there were thousands of small swallows flying in the sky overhead. The sky was turning red and purple because it was sunset. It was absolutely beautiful, very peaceful.","On July 4th, I was at home in the morning doing nothing and feeling kind of sad. I unexpectedly got a call from one of my friends, and she invited me out with her and her boyfriend. I was kind of surprised and pleased at the same time.

We ended up going to the movies to see Spider-Man, and it was such a funny movie. After that, we got dinner at a local Mexican restaurant nearby. I ordered tacos, and my friends ordered nachos to share.

We left the restaurant after finishing our meals and saw a food truck selling ice cream across the street. We decided to get ice cream cones for dessert. We walked about for a bit while we ate our ice cream and chatted about different things.

About an hour later, we found the perfect spot on the grass near a bridge with an open view of the sky. My friend made a comment that it would be the perfect spot to stay and watch the fireworks. I agreed, and we sat down and waited for the show to start.

After the fireworks show was over, we all went home. I felt so happy that my friend wanted to share that holiday with me, and it made my entire day so much better. I was very happy.",3,40,245
"This story may be repetitive, but we had a little issue with the setup of the computer. Here, it didn't take the whole story, so I'll start again. So, I wanted to talk about my little city garden. I have been replacing a lot of plants that were in my garden with native pollinator-friendly plants. It has been a lot of work, but I believe it's paying off. I have been having butterflies in the garden - Monarch butterflies and Swallowtail butterflies. It has been a joy to see that the work has paid off because in the city, we need more green, we need more butterflies.","I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at the University of Nebraska, and my specialty is in Risk Management. I spend a lot of time working with farmers and policymakers. I write papers to help improve the US Crop Insurance industry.

I grew up on a farm, and my dad told me to stay away from farming, and that could have been my dream, but there's no future for that size of farm or where it was at that time. Now that I have an academic position, I get to go back and help him farm, and I get to invest in his farm. So, it's gotten me back to it just in a way I never thought would happen.

You can't let just your desires to do something keep taking over. You have to have a condition that you need to make some money. But don't run from challenges. When it seems scary, that's good because it's going to provide an opportunity. That's the positive side of risk.",3,124,199
"Here's my story today. And maybe it's more a reflection than a story, but just wanted to talk to you about my son's 40th birthday. It crept up on me, and that was interesting. He lives in another state. Now he's married. He has a child, and we do not have a day-to-day communication relationship. So he's very busy. So we catch each other when we can. Birthdays always make me reminisce about them growing up, both my sons. But this one was my younger son. So different. You think about a day that we were born, when you drop them off at kindergarten, their first day, first grade, and on to dropping them off at college and all that, and then their wedding. It's a lot of emotions during the day when they have their birthday, it always seems to happen to me. But now he's 40, and he has his own life, his own family. And our conversations are so different now. It's no longer the parent-child conversation. It's two adults talking. He told me all about how his house is coming along. He's doing a lot of renovations. He has a new job and wanted to talk about his daughter, who was starting second grade next week. So it was all very pleasant. But it's so different. It's just how life evolves over the years, from parent child to a different kind of relationship. And it is a little bit like the tables are turning. So a lot of memories in this city, a lot of memories. But that was today. And it always happens during their birthdays. So that's my story today.","On May 21 of this year (2019), my very first niece had her 15th birthday celebration. Since she was a little baby, I was waiting for this moment because she has a personality that makes me feel like I have my sister back when she was young. That is because of several reasons. My sister is no longer with us, and she is like the memory we have of my sister. 

Now why was that date so important to me? Well, I am not exactly in my home country. I am living abroad because of my career, but for that date, I wanted to jump from my place to her place just because I cannot miss that once-in-a-lifetime event for my niece. I bought a flight ticket, I had a layover for about 12 hours in another country, I got sick because of the meal, but you know what? I don't regret it at all. 

At the end of the day, I saw her face, I saw how happy she was in her party celebration, and also she was happy to see me there. I could dance with my little niece, who is my little baby as well, and I will remember that for the rest of my life. 

I said to her that when I was in the airplane, I saw her mother in the sky. She told me to carry her and said, ""I love you"" on behalf of her. My niece was so happy, she hugged me, and I whispered, ""Your mother is so proud of you, honey."" I am pretty sure my sister was also dancing in heaven. 

The night was too short, but the memories are infinite because each second was valuable. I have to travel back the next day, without anything in my bags, but my heart full of love. Family is the treasure that will always make your life valuable.",3,332,366
"Hello. Hi, I belong to an organization of elderly retired people who take care of each other. When somebody is not feeling well, we can run errands, walk the dog, that kind of thing. But we're also branching out to a more social adventure so we can bring people outside and be social because it's a real problem among the elderly that they are too isolated.\n\nSo in the beginning of the summer, I started a bocce group. I think it originated in Italy, with throwing balls down the lane. People get competitive. It's interesting. It has not been easy to get people to join. People tend to be busy, I think. They're a little worried about going outside and doing a game with other people, but I think it's worth keep on pushing it.\n\nLast night we had a very nice group together. We actually had two teams and we played for about an hour. It was really nice. We laughed a lot. People got a little competitive, etcetera, and it was fun. Now my goal is to get more people to join because I think it's good for people to be outside, do a game, and have fun. So that is my goal for the next couple of weeks. I hope we can keep playing into the fall and that we get more people to join. We'll see what happens and we'll all have to come up with something different when the weather gets colder. But that's my story today.","Last month, I was part of an amazing charity event that blew my mind and made me feel like I was making a difference. I was told about this event about 3 months ago, and we formed dance groups in order to raise funds for children and families in Haiti. The host of the event was going to personally fly to Haiti to deliver items and school supplies to the families with her charity group and make a difference in her community.

I did not think much of the event as I have been in events before, but this event was life-changing. I met so many new people in our dance community with such loving and caring hearts. We all became one that day and supported and cheered each other on to do our best. Each dance group had something different to bring to the stage, and many genres were learned and appreciated. We all were amazed at the hard work and dedication that was brought to make the event such a huge success.

At the end, the event was able to raise a lot of funds for the children of Haiti, and many school supplies were donated for them to have a successful school year. It was a truly amazing event that I will never forget surrounded by even more amazing people.

In the end, it wasn't about the dance groups, the attendees, or who did the best. It was all about the kids and who we were raising money for. Doing good for your community as well as others in need really humbles you and makes you realize how much you have. It is very important to realize these things in life to really appreciate the life you have been given and what you can do to make it even better for others.

If I was given the opportunity to take part in another event like this, I would do it in a heartbeat. I'm sure the rest of my colleagues would agree as well.",4,290,365
"Okay. I went to the movies yesterday, and it was sort of interesting. It was a movie called ""Jewels."" And it\'s about an elderly man who has started to get memory issues. But one night he was asleep, and a small spaceship landed in his backyard. Sounds silly, but it was a real sweet story. It ruined his garden, and an ex-movie found a little alien on his doorstep. Like an alien with big eyes, but it wouldn\'t talk. And he had to figure out what he could feed it. But he took it inside and then he called the authorities about what had happened, and nobody wanted to believe him. He talked to some friends; they didn\'t believe him. His daughter thought he was crazy, and she took him to a neurologist to get his memory checked. But two friends happened to come by to check on him and went into the alien. So the three of them started taking care of a little creature, and it was quite an interesting story. Quite sweet. But it sort of resonated with me because a couple of days ago, I was somewhere with some friends, and we did something; I can\'t even remember what. And I mentioned, thinking out loud, ""Oh, this is a good story for my robot."" And it looked at me sort of strange. And I said, ""Yeah, I\'m working with this robot study for the Media Lab at MIT."" And they just looked very puzzled, and they just changed the subject. It was really interesting selling this whole alien thing and really happened. I could relate to that. See what other notes that I have on it, but I just keep thinking that even things like a gbo robot could be just like the little alien, meaning something to elderly people that are alone and don\'t see a lot of people during the day. And it could create some kind of friendship. There\'s three older people really open up to each other and talked about their past. And they were telling everything to the alien, who basically just stared at them and he wouldn\'t talk, but it was the cutest story when the alien got their little spaceship working again and he wanted them to come with him to outer space. In the end, it didn\'t work, but it was cute. But it seems just like, how can people relate to other creatures that are not really people and yet it\'s sort of a beneficial social companionship. So those are my thoughts. And I think that\'s it for today.","I heard this story where this kid, who has autism, could connect and share his experiences through Elsa when Elsa closes the door on Anna, and how she's feeling in the room. He could then communicate with his mom what he was going through. 

And it was just things like that. We're gonna make sure we make the best movie for this, for the audiences who really don't know what the people who watch these films are going through. 

I think that was a good motivation to get through all of those times of like, it's really late; I have to come in and do overtime for this. But it's worth it. 

So all those experiences, even though it didn't seem like it was heading in the right direction, it did help me in the end.",2,498,158
"So today, I was giving a swim lesson and I had a very difficult person to teach today who wasn't listening. And it made me very frustrated at that person. But overall, it made me have to go back and try something new and adapt to the situation. Although I was annoyed a little bit, but overall I did get $50, so it was worth it in the end.","One time, I had a coworker who would constantly use the phrase ""like I said."" I would estimate he said that phrase about 100 times a day at work to various people.

For example, pretend he was training you on a task that involved about 50 steps. Here's how he would typically talk:

You: so on step 9, do we have to ensure step 7 passed first?

Him: Like I said, steps 8 and 9, you have to do that, yes. Also, like I said, please bring up questions when we haven't moved to the next step first.

You: Great, I know what to do now.

Him: Also, like I said, I hope you're keeping notes on all of this. Since, like I said, it's nice if we don't have repeated questions in these meetings.

Personally, I think it's rude because about half of the time he would explain something complex one time or maybe even not at all. So, I feel like it shows impatience. Maybe I'm wrong though, and other people think it's normal to talk like this.",4,79,223
"So, about two weeks ago, I went to do an open water swim, which I haven't done in four years. So over the summer, I did quite a bit of swimming and working out to make sure I was in shape for the event. And then I got there, and there were tons of people. It was a two-day thing. I swam on the second day, but overall, I successfully finished it, and I got second place in my age group. So, I got a medal to take home, which is pretty cool. But it's good to see that all the work I did paid off, and it was a super fun experience to do.","In 5th grade (when I was 10), I joined my school's cross country team. My friend joined as well. She was already the MVP and had an amazing season; I was about 5th best on a very small team.

Today we were catching up at our lockers and I asked about the football game this past Saturday (we won); the topic switched to my cross country meet that morning. She was at the finish line when I won.

Back to today, she was mentioning how fast I've gotten and how proud she was of me. That hit hard because she's always been good at any sport she's tried, and I finally feel like her: winning!

She made my day better and gave me a little confidence boost for training and racing.",4,135,153
"So, about two years ago, I was in a pretty challenging course with optional homework. I took the option and didn't do any of those homework because it didn't affect my grade. But then, coming up to the exam, I thought I knew everything that I needed, and the exam was a wake-up call where I didn't do so well. And looking back at the optional homework problems, they were very similar. So, I learned from that just to do those problems which, in the end, helped me do better on the following exams. But that was probably the worst test I ever did because I wasn't very prepared.","I am sitting here, studying calculus for my NES EAS for the elementary ed exam coming up. All of the practice tests I have encountered included learning derivatives, something that I barely learned as I took calculus as a high school senior. I am questioning whether or not I should become an elementary school teacher because I have to calculate derivatives without a calculator in less than a week. 

I laugh at the ridiculousness of teacher's exams, with a 54 percent fail rate on the first try and then a quarter never passing. I am not surprised why there is a teacher shortage. 

In contrast, 85% of nursing students pass their tests on the first try.",2,128,128
"So, yesterday it was my birthday. I turned 23. And we went out to sushi last night, which was very fun. And I got a free dinner. And I went out with my friend, Amy. And a group of her friends whom I wasn't super close with, but I got to know all of them over dinner. And it was a very fun experience.","About a month ago, my parents had a birthday party. They rented a pavilion at one of the local parks and invited about 50 people. The theme of the party was ""When I'm 64,"" which is a tribute to the song of the same name by the Beatles.

They had the party catered, which was really nice. There was also a lot of beer and wine. The food was excellent. The bummer was that a lot of people didn't show up. In the end, we only had about 25 guests. This made my mom kind of sad.

My stepfather got very drunk. This made my mom very mad. I won't call it very successful because not a lot of people showed up, but we had fun. We played some bingo and horseshoes. We even had a trivia contest. It went on quite late, until about 9 pm.

My sister and I were the designated drivers. We also got to take home a lot of the food.",1,76,194
"So, over the last couple of days, I've been volunteering for International Orientation. It's for international students at MIT who have come from different countries. I met many new people, not used to interacting with so many people at once, but it was fine. All the new kids are very interesting to talk to and they have so many questions. I think I was able to help them with some of them. It's also great to get food from orientation because dealing with food over the summer hasn't been fun. But yeah, it reminds me of International Orientation last year when I was an incoming freshman. I was very terrified of talking to people because everything seemed like so much at once. But I made a lot of friends, and now lots of them are mentors too. And I hope we're able to show the kids a good time. Tomorrow is the last day of International Orientation, and after that all the other freshmen from the US will be here too, and soon school is going to start. I'm kind of excited for the next one.","I had a sister who told me there is more to life and encouraged me to go to school. I was good in art - I could draw well as a kid - so I enrolled in a professional art school.

There was a young, very enthusiastic professor who talked to my reporting class one day about words and pictures together - photojournalism. And that really appealed to me because it got both my writing side and visual side together.

I had no photography experience, so I started from scratch. I was an older student, probably a little more serious and didn't have any bad habits. So I became obsessed with that and became a double major with a specialization in photojournalism, minor in art. And I worked very hard at that then.

If I could wish upon you one thing, it would be that whatever you find to earn a living, you find something that you love to do.",3,212,176
"One of my hobbies is origami, and I'm going to tell you about how I started getting into it. I think that started when I was around 14 or 13. And one day, the idea of making a paper dragon popped into my head. I'm not sure where that came from, so I scoured the internet. I went on YouTube and tried to find a video of origami dragon instructions or a tutorial. I wanted a model that looked cool, and I wasn't really thinking about how difficult it would be to make.\n\nIn the end, I settled on some pretty complex models and tried to make them. Since I had never really done origami before, except for simple paper planes and unpapercrafts, it was very difficult. I'm talking about hundreds of folds, all made with great precision. So I tried over and over for a day, and then another one, and then it went to a week. I must have tried 20 or 30 times, each one taking hours. And then I couldn't go to finish. I even traveled a bit that week, and even during the journey, I was folding and folding and folding. I tried to fold that model so many times that at some point, I committed most of the folds to memory.\n\nAfter about a month of trying, I was finally able to finish making the model. It was very satisfying to have finally got it done. And that sparked my love for origami, and I went on to make many, many more models. And I still enjoy doing origami to this day. I also want to learn to design my own models and learn about the interesting math behind origami and research done in the field. But I think most of all, I just enjoy the process of folding and creating something with my hands. Once the model is finished, it feels like it's over, and I'm just looking for a new one to start working on.","I recently discovered textile media arts and am excited to get involved in it. I make quilts and will be incorporating this new medium into it. I watched a couple of videos on how to do it, and it looks like a lot of fun. I love quilting and sewing for myself, and upping my game will be fun. 

I recently quit going to a quilting group and have found that my creativity on my own has really increased. I am finding more to do. It's amazing that not going to a group will expand your horizons. At least it has for me. 

I have recently been doing a lot of sewing on my own and loving it. Changing the way clothes look, altering clothes, and trying different things with fabric. The different ways to use fabric have been a real challenge to me, and one I relish. 

It's fun coming up with art that is different from something someone else will do. Too many times we get stuck in a rut. Going out on your own is fun and wonderful.",3,377,202
"Okay. So here\'s a story I heard when I was a kid, and I think it\'s from an old Buddhist tradition. But I really like the story, and I still think about it occasionally. It\'s pretty meaningful to me. So here we go.\n\nIn the forest next to a big Kingdom, there lived a huge herd of deer. Their leader was the King Deer, with magnificent horns and a golden glimmering coat. One look, and you could tell he was the King of the deer.\n\nThe deer had one problem. The King of the neighboring Kingdom would like to hunt, and he would hunt with his soldiers, courtiers, and ministers. They would slay tens of deers every day. And to put an end to this madness, the deer came up with this lottery system approved by the King. Every day, the deer would all pick a leaf at random. And the deer with the most holes on the leaf would be sent as a sacrifice to the King. This way, the King of the Kingdom would not hunt the deer.\n\nSo the system is put into effect, and for many days, weeks, months, and years, the deer would pick a leaf every day and one would be sent to die.\n\nOne of these days, the King Deer heard some noise and went to investigate. He saw a few other deer ganging up on one doe and bullying it. He asked them, ""Why are you doing this?"" And they said, ""Today, it is this doe\'s turn to be sacrificed to the humans, and she\'s refusing to go.""\n\nThe conscience of the King Deer stirred. Is this an unfortunate fate that has led them to this cruel system? One where, by mere bad luck, one is sent to die? However, the system is the same for every deer, and they can\'t show favor to one doe or another. So, he asked, ""Why do you refuse to go to the humans?""\n\nThe doe pleaded, ""Please let me live another week. You see, the doe is pregnant, and her child will be born soon. And she doesn\'t want it to enter the world only to die with her. She wants someone else to go that day instead.""\n\nThe King hears her, and he realizes that he cannot send this doe and her child to die. Two lives gone where only one should be. But he also knows that he can\'t send any other deer in their stead, for that would be unfair to them.\n\nSo the dear King realizes and chooses to go himself. He sacrifices himself. Once the King sees him, he realizes at once that this is the King of the deer, and he is shocked. And goes hunting no more in the forest.\n\nHe sees the fragility and the vulnerability. And he realizes that the King sacrificed himself to save the life of an unborn child. The human King realizes that he can\'t hunt the deer anymore and is moved by the sacrifice of the deer King. And the deer are now free to live again.\n\nI really like this story because it shows that mercy is very powerful. And sometimes, you do have the power to make someone\'s life better, to help them. And maybe it will not be as hard of a sacrifice as what the King of the deer did. But in our own small way, we can help.","Initially, I did not want to be a teacher. But as I went through school, I realized by the time I was in high school that I needed to be a teacher. The reason that I needed to be a teacher was because I loved school a lot. I loved learning a lot. But I didn't have a teacher that I really liked.

I felt, at a young age, that if I had had that kind of experience where I felt connected to my school and connected to at least one teacher, I would've been an even better student, and school would've been a better experience for me.

I felt that when it was time for me to become a teacher, my job was not to be your friend, but for you to know, as strict as I was, that I still cared about you, and I cared about your achievement, and I cared about you as a human being.

I've gotten to a place in my life where what is most important to me is to make a difference, no matter how small or how big, it's to make a difference.

Whatever you decide to do with your lives, it has to be something that becomes your life work. It has to be your life work. Because this world now is at a place where you can make money, you certainly can make money. And you can make a lot of money. But your life's work, a piece of it has to be able to help other people.",5,653,295
"So, I was having a conversation with a friend today about how art is a very essential thing for humans. It's somewhat like pure expression of human spirit. But unfortunately, we sort of tend to restrict human or performers of art to only the very best. The people who become painters are the best at painting, the people who are the musicians are the best at music, and so on. And Project Trooper, we talked about participatory music, where the audience is part of the music as well. And it's just a thing that people do, as opposed to being an exclusive stage for professional musicians. So my friend brought up this study, which I thought was really interesting. In an Indigenous community in Peru, music-making is highly participatory. And an ethnomusicologist conducted a study there once. So any male community member is welcome to perform with pipes or flutes with his community, and anyone is welcome to dance. So, one time when the author of the study was at one of these events, there were two folks from the community who performed with extremely out-of-tune flutes. However, it seemed like everyone was having fun. The author of the study, coming from a very different background from the West, was driven crazy by the out-of-tune flutes and tried to stand as far away from them as possible. But he was shocked that none of the other players felt any or gave any indication that anything was wrong, and no one discouraged their participation. And later, he had a conversation with another professional musician about how to tune, and even he said he cannot bring himself to point out that the flutes were out of tune. So, this is very different from the society that I'm used to, which is where only the best are expected to perform, and music is often a way for the most talented people to showcase their talent. But since art is willing to grow to the human experience, isn't it better for music to be participatory? And you should probably be more accepting of all kinds of skill levels taking part in art instead of just putting the best on a pedestal. On the flip side, I also think that there should be people pushing art to its boundaries. And of course, that can't be everyone. I just think, and my friend thinks too, that everyone should get a chance to participate in music, just like that community. And curve.","I was born in Kenya. My parents are Indian. Then we moved to England when I was six. So, I grew up in England, and this was before there was a big Indian community in England, so I had to try and figure out who I was. College was transformative for me. I hope when I teach, I hope that it's gonna be transformative for my students as well.

One of the clips I play for my students all the time, from the Matrix, is where Morpheus is explaining to Neo, ""Do you really want to understand the world we live in? Because the Matrix is everywhere. If you do walk in, here's the red pill. If you take the red pill, then you will see the world in totally new ways. Or here's the blue pill, you can take the blue pill and it will just put you to sleep. It's not gonna challenge you in this world.""

Advertising and corporate speech have taken over the world in such a way that it is everywhere. We need more and more people to take the red pill so that we can really understand the world we're in and make real choices about where we wanna go.",4,470,240
"I'm going to tell you about the time I moved when I was eight, maybe nine. I think it was in elementary school, and I think that's what got me into reading and learning. So I just started school, maybe finished first grade in the middle of second grade, so maybe I was only seven. We moved homes, so it was still in the same city, but I didn't know any of the kids in the department we were looking into. And all my friends in the neighborhood were no longer there. So eventually, I did make a few friends, but in the beginning, there was not really much to do outside because I didn't know anyone. So I was at home. We happened to have a bunch of books at home, or like random encyclopedia books. And I decided to start reading them. And they were fun, and I liked learning about things around the world. And since it wasn't through school or I wasn't being forced to do it, I just thought it was fun. And if I forgot stuff, it was okay. Unlike school where you have to remember everything or try. So it was just fun, and I just wanted to accumulate a bunch of knowledge. And it was fun to throw it out randomly. And I always obsessed over it. I really liked that. And so it got me into reading. And then eventually, I started reading stories and fiction and stuff too. I haven't been reading as much these days, but I still love learning things. That stuck with me. It also helped me at school, somehow surprisingly, because later in higher classes, I would come across the same things again that I'd already seen in encyclopedias before, just through browsing. And it made school much easier for me. Yeah, my teachers are always kind of surprised that I've read this in some random, obscure book somewhere. That feeling of just learning things for the fun of doing it and satisfaction in doing it is something that I really want to keep with me.","I just want to cry. I'm so absent-minded and I feel like it's ruined my life. I don't even know how to stop being absent-minded. I've never been able to pay attention in school at all. I always daydream, yawn, fall asleep, draw, and fidget at school. I'm bad at useful subjects like math and science. I scored low on every math test so far in class.

Even when I've turned off my phone, I somehow find new ways to procrastinate. My sleep schedule is awful because I'm always up completing homework. I don't know how I'll ever adjust to a work setting, and it terrifies me. I can't focus because of how fogged up my brain gets. Whenever someone talks to me, I get surprised because I'm usually lost in thought, and it doesn't help that my anxiety causes me to look very nervous and shocked.

I'm so forgetful. I bought a poster for my room, and it took me four months to put it up. Likewise, I also bought lights for my room, and it took me an entire year to put them up. My parents will tell me to do something, and they'll have to remind me four times to do it, and it'll take me like 3 hours to do it because of how forgetful I am.

I see so many of my friends accomplish so much at this age, and I just can't seem to do anything. I don't have a job nor do I have my license. If I'm not anxious while driving, I'm probably not paying attention and will make a stupid mistake. My driving instructor had to keep repeating instructions like five seconds after the other because I couldn't focus. I have no idea how to overcome this.

I feel like I'm not as prepared as other kids my age, and I'm very behind. I just feel like I've wasted my life.",3,406,382
"So here's something I wrote about Doors, but it's really sort of a metaphor for irreversible things. There it goes. Imagine you're in the room, the kind of room which you never really think of leaving. There's a door, though. And in this otherwise perfect room, this door troubles you. You don't know what's on the other side? It might be paradise. It might be hell. It might be nicer than your room. It might be worse. It might bring you right back to where you are. Do you take the door? So the door turns out, it's just a doorway with one without one, you can always see the other side. And it looks like paradise. Since you can always return and everything will be exactly as it was before you left, you can choose to take the door. Just seems like an easy decision. I mean, if the paradise outside the window is an illusion, I can return and there's a safety net. And that's nice. So you could choose to take the door. Not much can go wrong. Okay. Now let's suppose the door was made of wood. So there's a door now, a real tangible one. You can't peek through. But you can still walk back if you take the door. You might enter paradise or you might rescind your house. You take the door. So out of ground this choice isn't much harder. Life in the room is nearly perfect, though, and would be at risk being thrust into hell for a chance of something better. I don't know. But in the end, you know you can always come back. So I take the door. Now suppose the door is made of glass. You can see the other side. And it's paradise. There's a lock, however, so if you leave the door, you will never return. All you have is the vision through the glass. So this is scary because it's permanent. And the glass lets you catch a glimpse of what's outside, but you can never really be sure until you go there. But you also don't need to leave immediately. I can stay in my perfect room for however long I want. And then take the door. Now, suppose the door is made of metal. You can't see through it and it will lock so you can only choose to exit and never return. Do take the door. Now this takes are much higher because you don't know what's beyond the door and you can never return, but you still have the option of waiting for long. You can spend your entire life in your perfect room and then take the door when you have nothing to live. But now imagine you have to do the whole thing again, with all these different doors, but you only have one night to decide whether you take the door at all if you do want, if you want to. It might be the best decision you ever make or the worst one. Maybe you never know what you missed. I can't decide whether I want to take the door in that one.","It seems like a lot of life is like building a tower for yourself. You advance in your career, you build social relationships, you get financial stability. Each building block on this tower that is my ""life,"" it feels like each part of the tower could so easily fall; a wrong career move, friendships fading, some financial stressor.

Each block I place on the tower is a negative action rather than a positive one, since all it does is fill me with terror. Other people have helped me build the tower. What will they think if it falls?

I just don't understand how people do it. They build these glorious towers and seem to view each block as so stable, each block as an achievement. I feel like I must be missing something, but I can't figure out what.

I'm so afraid of living the rest of my life like this, but it's what everyone else does and there's no way out beyond knocking over the tower and abandoning everything.",4,623,197
"Blue. Today, I attended the first lecture of one of my classes this semester, which is quite fun. The class is about J.R.R. Tolkien, the famous author of The Lord of the Rings. He was also a great scholar of medieval literature, languages, philology, and stuff. He had conversations with friends like C.S. Lewis, who, at least in the beginning, was an atheist and didn\'t believe in the value of things like God and metaphysics. But he later changed. He later converted. But that\'s not what I want to talk about. Today, we read a part of a poem written by Tolkien, which wanted to explain why metaphysics are important, because C.S. Lewis was of the opinion that metaphysics are just beautifully crafted lies. They have no truth in them, and therefore, they\'re not worth anything. And Tolkien\'s response was to compose a long poem about why metaphysics are useful. But one part that particularly caught my attention was the beginning, where Tolkien describes this fictional character called Miso Metis, who doesn\'t believe in the value of metaphysics. He says the person looks at natural objects like trees and just labels them ""trees"" and walks across the Earth as though everything is determined mathematically. Atoms move as they\'re expected, and every outcome is predictable, as if the world is just code regimented in a way where destined atoms are each moment\'s flame. So, it\'s like a very lifeless worldview. And he contrasts this with a different one in which he believes in a God and has a belief that there\'s some purpose beyond our comprehension, and God who made everything in the world. And these are not merely just objects that work according to mathematical principles, but more than that. I think this struck me because, like the professor mentioned, MIT students tend to have this worldview. And I think he\'s right. I think many people tend to view the world, at least here, as deterministic, a bunch of things that have predictable outcomes, and they can try and optimize for plans within their control to take advantage of this nature of the world. And they treat life as sort of an optimization problem, trying to get the maximum or some sort of maximal outcome. I don\'t think all MIT students are like this. I think a large chunk of them aren\'t, but there\'s definitely some subset which does think like this. I disagree with that worldview. I agree with Tolkien, and it seems very cold and regimented because if you treat life like an optimization problem, you would miss many things like art, which, in some sense, is a completely useless expression of the human spirit. But somehow, we need it. We need it in our lives. Although maybe a lot of it would never have been created with a completely scientific and rational point of view of the world. I also think it might not be worth micro-optimizing things and that part of life is experiencing imperfections and decisions. But maybe that\'s just me. I\'m not sure.","I like numbers. I like math, and in middle school, I found chemistry very interesting. There are so many elements in this world, and people use them wisely and they create a lot of components that don't exist in mother nature. And so, I think it is pretty cool.

I think it's very important to do what you are good at and find your own talents and enjoy your work. No matter what you are doing, as long as you enjoy it, you will be very good at that because you devote a lot of your thinking, your energy, your time to there and you can be better and better.",2,591,126
"Two: So here are some of my thoughts on being boxed and also starting out. Two sort of different but similar things. So let's start with being boxed in. Being boxed means that everyone around you, or at least many people around you, have a certain preconception of how you act and what you'll do. And it's quite hard to change their perspective because it's not really in your control. But whenever you do something which is outside the box they put you in, it's jarring to them and they don't like it. They try to make you not do that and you stay in your box, which is kind of awful because that means it's hard to change. Because people would find it odd if you try to change and people also make wrong assumptions about you. And sometimes they don't tell you about it and it can affect things adversely for a really long time. Conversely, people also try to fit in a lot, having sort of idiosyncrasies or different characteristics. As we heard, I'm humans naturally seek some sense of belonging, I guess because they're social animals, and that leads into fitting in. And this leaves the suppressing parts which make each person unique. And that's a little sad, actually, I think. A friend pointed out that this also depends on what kind of social structure you grew up in. For example, if you grew up in a more collectivist society, like say somewhere in East Asia or India, like me from childhood, you're expected to behave in the normal way and there are many more rules about fitting in with everyone else. And as a result, you sort of double up less, I think you develop less idiosyncrasies. When you're older, there isn't really much to suppress because you already fit in just because of the way you've grown up. Of course, fitting in in one of those societies, coming from the outside with the only unique characteristics, will be much harder. Conversely, somewhere like the US, which is very individualistic, there's less of an expectation to fit in, but as a result, people develop their own unique behaviors. And some of these will be seen as extreme for people coming from more collective societies, and they would stand out. But standing out is seen as not a bad figure, which is great. I'm not sure if it's great but seems alright. So yeah, I've not had many experiences with standing out, at least that have affected me in a negative way. However, I do feel boxed in a lot. And once I started taking notice of when that's happening, I realized it happened nearly every day and definitely many times a week. And I'm not easily bothered by most things, but this is starting to get to me. And last week, I snapped at someone I perceived as boxing me, and I normally don't do that. And I still think why that bothers me so much. And I think the main reason is it prevents you from changing and doing things you find interesting just because it doesn't fit in your box. Even today, someone told me that when I told them about talking to you, they said they wouldn't have expected me to have done something like that. Basically, I'm not in their box. And I really don't like that. Not many things annoy me, but that is one thing that does.","All my ""Friends"" make fun of me for being bad at video games. Same with physical stuff. Got beat by every single one of them in races and arm wrestles. I get told I'm too skinny or all the sports I play are girly, and even with so many sports to my name, I still get destroyed in races.

I'm the laughingstock of my class. I feel like a joke, and my parents laugh at me too. I feel insecure about my body.

A girl next to me straight up said I look ugly because I have a bit of a mustache growing, and my jaw is too feminine. I feel mentally insecure. I'm not popular, I'm not strong, I'm bad at video games except for the ones none of my classmates play.

And I've been challenged by the same girl who made fun of my face to an arm wrestle tomorrow. She does several forms of martial arts.",2,677,185
"About. So. The story is about my friend who just is leaving Cambridge. And. Is traveling like a nomad, like he's going to Italy, and then he's meeting her family there. And then she will be like she doesn't know where is she going to keep traveling. And. I have been regretting not traveling this summer. So, yeah, I just feel like I just had a very busy summer. And I am regretting not traveling.","When I was in my investment banking job, I was thinking about where I'm gonna go on my next vacation. Because now I actually had the money to travel and I had some vacation days. All my friends, my colleagues started coming to know me as the travel desk. I was doing that at work and with my friends, and some of them said, hey, why don't you just start a blog? So I started writing about my own travels, and that's the blog that seven years later, I'm doing this full time now.

As I was writing about different restaurants, especially ethnic restaurants in Atlanta, I wanted to know the background of them. That's why I started traveling there. I would meet locals, go to their homes, take cooking classes, and learn more about the origin of those cuisines and then come back and have a different take on it.

I've been to about 75 countries, and I only speak three languages. I think you have to be just very humble and open-minded. If you're more accepting, people will just open up, even if you don't understand the language.",3,92,225
"One, so I think it is just like one of the things. That. What was that? Like? I was talking to some other girl, and she was like, she was getting concerned about it. That, why do you talk? And then I told her something that happened a day before, and she was like, ""Why didn\'t you tell me yesterday?"" And at the time it happened. So she just said like whatever has happened, like she wants to know at that moment and that second. But given that everyone is busy, if I tell her anything beyond a day, she feels like, okay, that is something you\'re telling. I think she misses acknowledging the fact that she got to know from me, and she delves into the part that, ""oh, I missed something knowing yesterday."" And then I am hiding other things as well, and she feels that she\'s not getting to know the entire thing.","I got harassed by my dad. It used to be just him messaging me asking me for pictures of me. I had a bad gut feeling about it, so I would often ignore or avoid it. Then he moved on to saying ""I'm in the bathroom doing you know what"" and ""This parking is nice, you can do whatever you want and no one will see.""

Last night, I was at my parents' house and I was half-woken up by a touch on my leg. I don't know if it actually happened, but I think it did.

I don't know what to do because I feel bad for my mom. I want to cut off ties with him, but I can't do that without hurting my mom. She's a housewife with no job and savings, so if I tell her the truth, she'll leave and life will be tough. I don't make enough for both of us to be comfortable. I'm not even sure she'll believe me.",1,189,199
"So my story is about my feelings that got activated about the feelings of jealousy that got activated when I got to know that a friend of mine, who is younger to me, got a job. And I just feel that I am running behind in my life, certain aspects. And there are people, and people around me, who are like having the same level of achievement at a younger age. So I just feel like jealousy and not good, and that I think stems from my limitation somewhere.","One of the things my parents always taught me was to always take pride in your work, regardless if it's cleaning toilets. Even though I was working just at the mall, I still took a lot of pride in work and being a holiday cashier. Eventually they kept me on. It ended up being something I fell in love with. 27 years later, I'm still here.

When I left my hometown, I was 21. I was moving to Los Angeles. I had just finished college. My aunt was talking very negatively about my decision: ""You're gonna fail, you're gonna come back crawling,"" anything you can imagine that would be demotivating. I didn't talk back to her, but I internalized a lot of her negativity and processed it more as empowerment.

It's interesting because many years later, the whole family knows what I do for a living now, and even she has said, ""I am so proud of you."" And I said to her, ""You're part of the reason that I made it, because your non-belief in me actually pushed me just as hard as the people that did believe in me.""

So don't ever let anyone that doesn't believe in you affect your strength, just channel that energy in a very positive way.",2,99,257
"Done. So, I am moving from my current location to where my girlfriend lives. And my plan was to send the boxes of my stuff to her place, that is her house. And she initially mentioned that ""you really need to send those multiple boxes"". Then we kind of figured it out. And the last time we talked about it, it was more humorous, like ""oh, really? Where are you sending those boxes?"". ""Oh, my address."" ""Okay."" And this time yesterday, it was again that sense of ""thing"" where she doesn\'t want me to send those boxes. And she said, ""wasn\'t it just one box? Are you sending multiple boxes to my house?"". And it makes me feel that I am dependent on her for shipping those boxes and I am asking her for a favor. And it makes me feel like it just pushes my self-respect in that sense. And I don\'t really feel good about it. And I have been angry all night and all day.","My best friend in the world hit me during a fight a couple of months ago. It was an open-handed, angry slap on the face, followed by frozen shared shock. 

It all started when we were arguing over who should be doing what tasks around the apartment. I was living with her for a few months until I could get on my feet because I was new to the city. And at a distance, with enough time between interactions, the bossy, assured nature she would dictate our time together in was almost a comfort. I really liked having her be that for us, and I think she really enjoyed having me being compliant and helpful. 

But when a few times a month became everyday, the tension began to build. Perhaps I would offer to take the dogs out a few days she was busy getting ready in the morning. Then the next week, she would ask me every day to take her dogs out and to also feed them. When the clothes sitting in the washer were blocking me from doing my laundry, I would go ahead and finish out her loads of laundry. Then the next week, she would ask me to do her laundry for her. 

It would even be things that weren't house care related. If she didn't want to be alone doing something, she would ask me to accompany her to do it - perhaps watching her hang up her clothes, or sitting with her while she studied. 

Well, one particular night it came to a head when she asked me to come help her clean up the kitchen. I had not dirtied up the kitchen, and I didn't want to clean it up. And when she would ask for help doing something, you can bet that meant I was just going to do most, if not all of it, and she absolutely used that to her advantage. But this night, I said no. 

She was so taken aback by this that she got angry with me. I was so offended that she would get mad that I declined to help on this ONE thing that it escalated quickly over the next 40 minutes. We started kitchen-sinking, mudslinging, slandering, defaming each other just specifically calling out every minuscule problem we had with each other over the past month. Until eventually, we got up in each other's faces and she slapped me across the face. 

It's been about 4 months since then, and we still haven't spoken. I just hope that one day we can get past this because it breaks my heart that such a stupid beginning of a fight has ended in more serious sadness.",2,206,502
"So, I was trying to send my stuff as I\'m moving to my girlfriend\'s house, but my girlfriend objected to that, saying that her parents don\'t like me sending my stuff to her house. And if she was not clearly telling me why because she was like, ""I\'ll be more hurt if I listen to that point."" And now I am wondering why her parents talk about something hurtful to me. I have spent time with them and I thought it was all good. But I am having very broad questions on this. So guide me too.","My husband and I got married 5 months ago and lived in separate parts of the world until now. Currently, I've moved in with him in his apartment here.

Ever since I got here, I've noticed that he's always on his phone or laptop. Since he works from home, I do understand that it is necessary for his profession, but even after work hours, he's always consumed with his electronic devices and watches movies/documentaries or texts with friends, and it really makes me feel like I'm being ignored.

I'm trying so hard not to let it bother me, but I can't help it. I feel like he has all the time in the world for his friends and family, but when it comes to me, there's no concern. Even if I try to have a conversation with him, his entire focus will be directed on the phone.

I'm a non-confrontational person and don't know how to bring this up without it sounding accusatory.",1,112,191
"One, my story is about my nephew. I had a very long conversation with him today. He is young right now. He's just starting his college. And he has been, like, decently a good student. Like in the initial school days, he was not that great, but he actually picked himself up and got good marks. But now, as I've been talking to him, I feel that he's targeting his aim too low. And he's just happy with anything. And he doesn't have a lot of cognitive sense to himself. And I get very angry at things when I hear that. These are so easy. Why don't people think about it? And I get irritated and I shout at him. And then I feel that I'm not treating him well. And I might not be a good uncle to him.","Today, I was talking with a friend in school. Beside him were two of his friends from his class. We were waiting for a teacher to bring a ball so we could hoop a little before I went home.

But there was this girl beside him who was one of his mates. During the conversation with me and my friend, she kept looking at me weirdly and then looking away when I looked back. In a weird way. Almost staring at me.

When I said bye and turned my back, she started talking. And it felt like she was talking negatively about me behind my back. She was so awkward the whole way through as I was talking with my friend.

I had this sudden feeling of anger and hatred just rising within me. And many fantasies of killing her slowly popped up in my head. I had an overwhelming amount of hatred. I have never felt so angry and hateful towards someone for looking at me weirdly.

It stuck with me in my head until all the way home. I stopped and tried to observe why I felt this way. But I couldn't understand. Worse things have happened in my life, and I felt more passive about it. But this... It nearly ruined my whole day, and I couldn't stop thinking about it.",2,169,251
"Yeah, I\'ve been reaching out to more people and seeing if I can talk to more people in this New York City and get to know more people around here. I had a dinner with a friend last week, which was really nice. It was really good to have common friends and then catch up. We had Korean food, which was really nice. And I think she is Chinese. I don\'t think she ever had Korean food, I don\'t know. It was very new for her, so it was really nice just to explore something new together. She\'s a master student, so she\'s still studying. That was interesting to hear what she\'s been doing and what? Yeah, I just graduated so I could see, I could see whatever she was going through, like how I was also going through the same things and how difficult it is to start studying again, and then be in this new space where you\'re supposed to perform so much, but then you\'re also trying to get somewhere. But it\'s also really confusing and scary. So I could empathize with that, I think. But then, yeah, it was interesting. I did feel like not heard in that whole conversation. It was very one way, she didn\'t ask a lot about me, which is fine. But it was like a network dinner, and not like ""Oh, friend"" kind of thing, which is also fine. I think not every person you meet is going to be your friend, but it was like a new thing to try, which was nice.","Within this year, I have gone back to college to get my degree in science. For years, I have not gone to college because of my physical and mental health but decided to try because I have always wanted to complete college. It was hard. My skin condition made it painful to sleep, let alone study and attend class. I sprained my ankle, got the flu, and almost quit, but I kept going despite having every excuse not to.

Then, by the end of the semester, I was given a ""fun"" assignment by our Psychology professor to do something that would make us feel uncomfortable and write how we overcame that. At the same time, I had to give a TED Talk-style speech in my Writing and Research class, so this was a great opportunity to do both. I felt uncomfortable, and I even regretted it at first, but I was able to complete both of my assignments and ended up getting a B+ for each of those classes while getting As for my Math and History classes.

This was a roller coaster of emotions, but I'm glad I did it. Now I'm stronger to continue on to my next semester, which is just one week away. I was surprised at myself. I quit college three times the first semester before this, so I was afraid I would have to pay for it all again. But it was worth it.

Now I'm a step closer to my goal, and I feel that I'm not just learning the subject of each class. I'm learning how to take notes better and how to approach real-life problems with the tools I've learned in Psychology.",2,310,320
"Like, I think one story or just like an interesting thing which I observed, I have is, it\'s all important to have representation at work or at the places that you are at because that sort of makes different people feel comfortable and more accepted, and more accepted, that\'s the word. For example, if I\'m in a different country or a different state, which I don\'t know anything about, and if I\'m walking there, if I\'m around people who have different experiences in life, I feel it takes a lot of time to just get comfortable around them, to feel more confident about yourself, to know and see how you can pick one and survive, but also thrive there. It takes a lot of time and it\'s helpful just to be aware of that and not be like ""Oh, there\'s something wrong with you,"" but they\'re just like a different environment and the people are different. Everyone\'s trying.","When I started, I didn't know that I wanted to be in pharma. I love the industry for what it can do. I actually hated how they got it done. I didn't love the formula of the business practices in pharma, which is why I started my own. But the truth is, along the path, I was in an industry that was mostly male-dominated. If I looked up in the organization, nobody looked like me. There wasn't a lot of female leadership, there still isn't today.

So my best way to make change is to be a leader in the industry. When I was on the path with Addyi, people called it the little pink pill. And they would say, aww, the little pink pill. And isn't that cute? When I realized that there was so much dismissiveness underneath it, I started showing up in blazing hot pink.

It's the gender stereotype. Instead of coming back from it, I'm going straight for it, so we can talk about it. I think if you feel like you don't fit in the system, the way to make your way into it is to surprise people and continue to show up. Never let that underestimation shake your confidence in what you're set out to do.",3,188,250
"Yesterday, yesterday, we went to another friend's house. There were a lot of people around, 20 to 30 people from our church. And we brought Samba. We played volleyball and Samba. Other dogs and we also had a lot of fun there.","I recently went to Mexico for my 25th birthday. It was exciting because I haven't been there before, and it was a chance to get a group of my friends together. We spent 4 days over there, and we had events planned every day. It was busy but definitely a lot of fun.

The first night, we just relaxed at the resort. The second day, we went zip-lining, which was extremely fun. We also went to a cenote.

The last day, we went on a catamaran to Isla Mujeres, which was breathtaking. Being on that boat and looking at the view was incredible. My most memorable moment was definitely when the tour guide danced around the catamaran and poured us drinks. It was a lot of fun, and I felt relaxed.

The view was phenomenal, and just being with my friends was great. The sea was super blue, and it was breathtaking.

The whole trip, we ate to our heart's content. It was great food, and all of the drinks we could have. It was one of my best trips, and I will definitely remember it for a while.",3,51,220
"Hello. The story I'd like to tell is about my desire to have my foot heal faster than it is. The doctor told me that it would take two months for me to be able to be weight bearing again on my foot that had surgery. However, I assumed that I would heal faster and that it wouldn't be as painful as it was, the recovery that is.\n\nWell, six weeks in, the doctor said things were coming along smoothly and that I could start doing some weight bearing and start physical therapy. So, that was a week ago yesterday. Things are getting better, but I'm not progressing as quickly as I would like. I guess that's what we all think we're going to do something faster, better, or whatever than the average.","I ruptured my ACL and had to have surgery. The initial injury and surgery recovery has been so draining. I'm still sore and my leg is weak, but I'm in the least amount of pain that I have been in two weeks. I'm finally able to walk around the house without a brace. Things are looking up.

On top of everything, I haven't been able to take my dog on walks or play fetch like we used to. Loved ones have been coming over to help, but all I've been able to do lately is offer cuddles, which is great, but seeing how happy she was today when I was finally able to play with her on the couch was everything.",1,152,138
"One experience I'd like to share is that of traveling as a lone person. On one trip to Spain, I lived there for several months without knowing anyone, but I had contacts, so I wasn't alone. And one morning, on my way someplace, it was a Sunday morning, and as I was walking down the street, I learned something about the Spanish culture in the area that I was in. That staying out late, and perhaps I mean by late, I mean to dawn beyond the madrugada, was a common experience that people didn't feel badly about, especially when they had overexcesses in drinking and were sleeping on the street. So, I was walking down this street on a sidewalk in Avocado and I started seeing lots of people sleeping, relying on the sidewalk. And it's a little disconcerting because the environment that I hailed from, that wasn't a common experience. I didn't live in a city while living in Boston. Boston kind of goes quiet after midnight, 01:00 in the morning. South Florida, where I came from, there wasn't really no city place that you went. Maybe Miami, but nobody really went to Miami. You stayed in the fun areas where you were near. It wasn't a city like Boston. Let's put it that way. And as I'm walking down the street, I see these people in various states of deep sleep or slowly waking. Get a little bit disconcerted. I didn't see any women. It was all men. And I started to get a little bit nervous, but I was by myself. So I had to figure out how to do this. And so I chose to walk down the middle of the street. It was interesting to me to see how I adapted when I put distance between me and that which was uncomfortable or discomforting. Putting that distance between me and the sidewalk by walking down the middle of the street. Yes, I had some fear that perhaps somebody would wake from their slumber and I don't know, verbally. I really didn't think so much physically, but just verbally. I'm not a confrontational person. So I have often thought about that when you put distance between yourself and that which makes you uncomfortable. Kind of avoidance. But yeah, there's my story.","My daughter and I took a trip to California. She read online about the train going down to California. It was highly romanticized, but it did look nice. We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery. It surprised me that the food was so good. 

However, one of the really surprising things was the people we met. When they seat you at dinner, they put you with strangers so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story. The stories were so interesting and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them. In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once. It was really amazing. One person was nearly 94, but he appeared to be in his seventies. One couple was from the Philippines. One man was laid off and took a low-end job, and he admitted that his parents were supporting him. 

There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and I kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story. Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story. We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures, and it became very raw and personal. 

Previous to this trip, my daughter and I had not been very close. This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close. But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me. What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband. It was so surprising because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy. 

Yet through the stories of strangers, I feel closer and more focused than ever. When she was little, we were so close. However, as she became a teenager, we had a more strained relationship. But after this trip, we are as close as ever.",3,452,398
"My family. I had a family of four siblings, two older sisters. My brother, who was eleven years older than me, and then me. And there was kind of a dichotomy in the household. The two older sisters, they were accomplished, very beautiful. And they were in their own world. And I was sickly and a bookworm. Stayed at home all the time. And the only person there for me was my brother. And even though he was eleven years old, he always made time for me. And he did things with me every Saturday afternoon at the matinee on TV. We\'d watch The Three Stooges. And we\'d watch horror movies, those old Universal Horror movies. And he just made me feel special. And the song that reminds me of him most is ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" because when I was nine years old, I attended his high school graduation. And no, I was seven years old. I\'m sorry. I attended his graduation. And when he stepped off stage, he received his diploma. And then he received a notice from the army recruiter that he was drafted to go to Vietnam. So the song by Peter, Paul, and Mary, ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"", became the song my mother and I would always listen to and think of him. And it just was very poignant and it meant a lot. And it was just I was bullied and a very sad child. And he brought sunshine to my life and spent time with me and loved me. So I felt very happy. But that song my mother and I would always cry. So anyway, that was my first story to introduce you and to tell you a little bit about me. Fortunately, I\'m a lot better but I just wanted to tell you that song means a lot to me and my brother meant a lot. So thank you for letting me share.","On Thanksgiving Day -- that's the only day my parents would take me out to dinner -- there was this woman going through a garbage can with her little daughter, about three or four years old, picking out her Thanksgiving dinner out of a garbage can. At that point in my life, I began to think, it's not as good on this planet as I think it might be.

One of the things I wanted to do when I grew up was to try to make the world a better place. But I didn't have an awful lot of confidence getting there. Because as a Puerto Rican kid in New York going to some terrible schools, nobody ever told me as a kid that I could really amount to much at all.

But finally, I met someone who helped me, and I was able to make the leap. And then when I got into college and met some professors that had some faith in me and encouraged me to go to graduate school and so on and so forth, I always pointed my life in that direction.",3,377,205
"Well, I\'m going to tell you since my last story was kind of modeling, I will tell you a funny story. Well, my husband and I lived in Florida for quite some time. And we were on the beach. And there was a brand of suntan lotion that I had used before. They use it a lot in tanning salons, but it\'s also a really good suntanning lotion. So I grabbed it because I think it was like 15 or 18 SPF that we used all the time. And that day, I grabbed it. We put it on. We stayed out from about 10:00 a.m. We broke for lunch around noon and then remained out for another 3 hours. So we didn\'t eat that day on the beach and we stopped at a restaurant that we knew on the way home. And we noticed people looking at us really strangely. So I looked at him. He looked at me. We were still kind of sunblind from being out in the sun so long. So he looked behind me. I looked behind him so we couldn\'t figure it out. So we said, ""I said, I\'m going to go to the restroom and see if I look funny or anything."" And he said, ""Me too."" So the bathrooms were right next to each other. So I looked in the mirror and I said, ""Oh, my God."" And I heard from the other bathroom him exclaimed the same thing, ""Oh my God."" And what had happened is I had grabbed tanning accelerator instead of tanning lotion, and we were as red as lobsters. So long story short, if you are going to be in the Gulf of Mexico suntanning, you should make sure you\'re using proper suntanning lotion. Okay? That\'s it.","For 7 months, we'd been saving for a family vacation. The first family vacation we'd taken as a family of four (plus the in-laws). We'd invited my in-laws to join us, an extra set of eyes to help keep an eye on the girls while we went to the beach (you never know when one of them is going to want to run off, and we didn't want anyone alone in or near the water). 

Not only was this our first family vacation as a family of four, but it was to the beach. The girls had never been to the beach before. We went to The Outer Banks, or OBX as the locals and annual visitors call it. We were so excited to see the expressions on our 1 yr old and 2 yr old faces; would it be joy or even possibly fear that they'd express? 

Shockingly, the girls aren't as much of a fan of the beach as their mother is. The response of our 2 yr old as she first stepped into the sand, ""Ew, yuck so dirty!"" was a laugh for all of us, but it should have also been a sign as to how they would like or dislike the beach. What kid doesn't enjoy getting a little dirty, or at least one would normally think? But not our girls. 

We didn't last more than 30 minutes building sand castles and standing on the sand, as the waves washed over our feet. They'd talk about going to the beach, but as soon as we'd get there, they'd be bored or tired of walking on the sand. 

Although the beach itself didn't go over as well as we'd anticipated, at least the girls enjoyed getting away and ""seeing"" the beach from a distance. And at least we got pictures we can look back at... however short the time was. And the memories... oh, the memories we created were priceless. 

Our first family vacation may not have gone over as well as we anticipated, but we all had a great time relaxing and enjoying time together. That's what matters anyway.",3,350,414
"Okay. I was married when I was young, and unfortunately, my first husband had a heart attack at a young age. And I had two young children to take care of. I hadn\'t dated or been out with anybody for years. My children were growing up - my son was in college and my daughter was 16. And she decided that she liked heavy music, so she wanted to go to Ozzfest in Georgia. So, a friend of hers, the mother, and I drove them to Atlanta. And we went to Ozzfest.\n\nI was getting something to drink for the mother, the other mother, and myself. And I was standing there, and I saw this man with the most beautiful hair I\'d ever seen. It was really long and just beautiful, thick, and beautiful. And I told him, ""You have the most beautiful hair of anyone I\'ve ever seen. Excuse me."" And he said, ""Well, thank you."" And, ""You look like you totally don\'t belong here."" So, I said I laughed, and we talked a little more. And I went and sat back down. And a little while later, I happened to look on one of the stages, and I saw him on stage performing with this band. I didn\'t even know he was a musician. And after the set, he came up to me and he said, ""Do you have an email?"" And I gave him my email address. And we started corresponding. And I married him two years later. And he\'s my current husband. And it was a really strange day, but it was one of the happiest days of my life. So, that\'s how I met my husband. He was playing at Ozzfest.","The day started perfectly, with a great drive up to Denver for the show. Me and my boyfriend didn't hit any traffic on the way to Red Rocks, and the weather was beautiful. We met up with my friends at the show, near the top of the theater, and laid down a blanket. The opener came on, and we danced our butts off to the banjoes and mandolins that were playing on stage. We were so happy to be there.

That's when the sunset started. It was so beautiful. The sky was a pastel pink and was beautiful to watch. That's when Phil Lesh came on, and I just about died. It was the happiest moment of my life, seeing him after almost a decade of not seeing him. I was so happy to be there, with my friends and my love.

There was nothing that could top that night. We drove home to a sky full of stars and stopped at an overlook to look up at them. I love this place I live. And I love live music. I was so happy.",5,346,211
"So yeah. So, I can share a story that happened recently. So, I went to Yosemite with my boyfriend two weeks ago. We went to see one of the biggest meteor showers during the year, and that was very fascinating. That was really my first time seeing so many meteors at one time. And then, however, a part of the sky was covered by clouds, so we couldn't see meteors throughout all the areas in the sky, but at least through a specific small area we have seen a lot of meteors, so I was pretty satisfied. And I was also very grateful for my boyfriend. He woke up so early at 3:00 a.m. and drove us up to the Glacier Point in Yosemite to catch the sunrise, which is very beautiful, although I was still sleeping all the way while he was driving. And then afterwards, we went on a little hike to the Mirror Lake. However, once we got to the Mirror Lake, it started to rain. So then the Mirror Lake was supposed to be very smooth on its surface so that it looks like a mirror. But because of the raining, the mirror was kind of rough. So it was a numb mirror, Mirror Lake. But we still got a little exercise by hiking towards it. So it was still very fun. And after that, we went home. That was a pretty fun trip. I want to share with you.","A memorable event is hiking at Providence State Park in Lumpkin, GA. This was a very special event because the day was epic. The day started out rather foggy for the two-hour drive south. The scenery along the way was beautiful as the sun was just rising. We started the trip early to arrive before others.

We packed our backpacks with snacks and drinks for the trail. The trail is about an 8-mile loop down inside canyons. When we arrived, we paid the $5 parking fee. We also took one last proper bathroom stop.

The view was amazing from the top walkway. No one else had arrived yet as we started our trek down. The canyon walls are made of Georgia Clay, and the trees were so green. We hiked for about four hours, took our lunch break, and then continued on.

There were plenty of canyon inlets we didn't get a chance to see on that trip, but one day real soon we will return and do it all over again. It's a memory I will forever cherish.",4,279,203
"So I\'d like to tell a story about how I really got interested in robotics. There was this moment when I was in a Lego Robotics competition where I first realized that all robotics has the ability to help people. And even if the project that I came up with was super dumb back then, and it was absolutely not realistic at all, the fact that I realized that it could help is kind of what kept me going. So then in high school, I continued to do robotics. I continued to do outreach for robotics, to get people to get the same kind of insight on, like, ""Oh, I could actually do stuff with this."" And even now, I\'m still following that same passion for how robots can help people. And I\'m still doing it now.","When I'd started to go to college, I went to a really big state university. I went to Texas A&M, and I was a marketing major, and I loved the College of Business. But my second education at A&M was all of the activities that I did because I was exposed to so many things. I really didn't know what I wanted to do when I graduated. There were a lot of paths.

After college, I was a tech consultant. I was there for a few years and decided I needed to take a leave of absence. There was something else out there for me, and 9/11 had happened, and I went to the local Red Cross in Houston. It was where I was living. They put me in the development department, which is fundraising.

When I made my very first phone call, the story on the other line was that of somebody desperately wanting to help. And during that call, I just felt like at that moment, we were just being human. My passion and my inspiration switched like that.",5,157,210
"Guys, so today I was watching an episode of Suits, and in Suits, there is a lawyer named Louis. The whole thing is a TV show that takes place in New York, in a law office. Louis is one of the lawyers who is constantly trying to be the best, and he always sees himself as inferior to Harvey, another character. And every time Louis tries to do some kind of payback for whatever Harvey did to him, it always ends up backfiring on him somehow. He always makes a bigger mess than what he started. What kind of resonated with me in this story is that it's not necessarily the greatest objective to try and be the best. Because if you are trying to be better than someone else, you're constantly competing and trying to undermine them or go against them. And while it can be healthy, to some extent, to have some competition, unhealthy competition doesn't make a lot of sense, and that kind of resonated with me. Because for so long, I competed in competitions for everything from math to science to robotics. And it was always like you had to be the best. And now, going past college, it doesn't make sense to try and be the best because everyone is doing something completely different from you. So just keep trying and undermining people will just backfire on you.","In first grade, when they asked me what I wanted to do, I said I want to study the stars. So, it's lucky that it worked out. Most of the times people say, I wanna be a football player, whatever, movie star, it doesn't work out. In my case, it worked out, but I was lucky that way. Astronomy, before I went to college, was something I really thought I could do.

But I just doubt myself a lot. It's inevitable. When you're trying to push yourself, there are always moments when you think, maybe this is too hard, maybe I cannot do it. But my answer to that is that if you don't feel that way, it means you're not pushing yourself enough. If you never go out of your comfort zone, then you're not really trying very hard. It's part of learning and part of growing up, is figuring out things that you didn't know you could do, and then you do them.

Sometimes you fail. Sometimes you succeed. First of all, in research most of what you do fails miserably because you're trying to do something that nobody knows how to do. So you have to really like failure. Embrace failure. Accept that failure is gonna be part of the process.",3,264,263
"So the play that I mentioned earlier, in the play, I take the role of a child who is really annoyed at having to do a service project, which is basically serving some burritos to a homeless population, and just really annoyed and frustrated and worried about my own material comforts. And then I realized that the homeless people can overhear me, and then I become super embarrassed and realize the fact that I can't really say bad things. I'm not supposed to say bad things about people because people might be hearing, and that wouldn't be very nice. And this kind of resonated with me because sometimes I do do things like that. Maybe not to that extent, but I don't want to load the dishwasher because I'm tired, but I need to load the dishwasher because maybe my mom is tired as well, and her arm is hurting, and therefore she can't do it. So I should probably help out. And it kind of just made me realize that, yes, sometimes I can be selfish, and I should be aware of that and not do that as often.","Initially, I did not want to be a teacher. But as I went through school, I realized by the time I was in high school that I needed to be a teacher. The reason that I needed to be a teacher was because I loved school a lot. I loved learning a lot. But I didn't have a teacher that I really liked.

I felt, at a young age, that if I had had that kind of experience where I felt connected to my school and connected to at least one teacher, I would've been an even better student, and school would've been a better experience for me.

I felt that when it was time for me to become a teacher, my job was not to be your friend but for you to know as strict as I was, that I still cared about you and I cared about your achievement, and I cared about you as a human being.

I've gotten to a place in my life where what is most important to me is to make a difference, no matter how small or how big—it's to make a difference.

Whatever you decide to do with do in your lives, it has to be something that becomes your life work. It has to be your life work. Because this world now is at a place where you can make money, you certainly can make money. And you can make a lot of money. But your life's work, a piece of it has to be able to help other people.",4,216,292
"I'm going to share something about work today. So, I've been doing an internship. It ends on this Friday. As part of the internship, my project has been basically to render a component on the page. And I spent probably six, seven, eight, probably eight weeks of my twelve-week internship trying to get this thing to render on the page. And I've tried multiple different things on, how do I get this to work? Everything from giving it the bare minimum to giving it almost everything it could possibly take. And it still doesn't work. And I guess in this case, good enough is much better than perfect because there is no way I would have been able to finish this project in twelve weeks. And I recognize that now. And it was frustrating at times. But understanding that I did enough work so that someone else can pick it up and continue is pretty okay with me. I'm okay with the fact that good enough is much better than perfect. And this kind of reflects in other aspects, too, right? Yeah, you could sit there and polish every single tile in your floor to a mirror sheen, but also you're spending so much time on something that you could be spending on doing something else. So you might spend, like, 12 hours on the floor and not touch anything else. And that's kind of a waste, honestly. So good enough is better than perfect.","When I first came into the Navy, I maintained radio equipment on submarines. It was an important job, but I didn't really feel like it was a big challenge. But I thought I could make it challenging by just being the best at that and finding new ways to accomplish a job or be more efficient.

And I've gone further in the Navy than I ever, ever fathomed, from a junior enlisted seaman to a captain in the Navy in 30 years. At each phase along the way, I had to pick, ""What is my goal here? My goal is to be the best naval flight officer or to be the best department head.""

So we need to have an internal spotlight. We need to shine a light on ourselves and go, ""Where do I need to improve?"" If you're not improving, then you're just not moving forward. But at the same time, you can be so critical of yourself that you're actually holding yourself back.

We're all talented. We all have special things that make us unique, and we all have something to offer the world. We just gotta go out there and offer it, but you have to do it in small steps.

So I've always been one of these people that believes that you need to be thinking about the next challenge. It's good to reflect, but you have to be moving forward.",4,284,276
"So, I guess here, the fact is, I'm not a huge fan of the work that I had to do in this past year for my research. It wasn't what I really wanted to do, but I did it anyway because I was being paid to do it. And now I'm almost done. I've switched over to a new strain of work that I am interested in, but I still have to wrap up the last bits of my old work by writing a paper. And I really can't find any of the motivation to do it because I did not like the work at all. But this is the only way to prove that I did any work in the entirety of the last year. So, I guess, the main thing I'm learning here is, there is a challenge there. I don't want to work on it. I have no motivation to work on it, but I need to get it done. So if anything, I'm kind of completing it out of spite. And it seems that spite is a pretty good reason to keep going because it's just to prove someone else wrong. That thought that you couldn't. I'm taking it as motivation to do something I really am not motivated to do: to prove others that I was wrong. Prove others that they were wrong about me.","I got a D- instead of an F in a government class. If I had gotten an F, I wouldn't have graduated. I didn't like school, so it was a particularly unrewarding experience for me. I've never been influenced that much by other people's comments or goals.

I work hard to make up my own mind with as much information as I can get. In fact, if I let everybody else influence what we were doing, the human genome wouldn't be sequenced now.

I'd say, first decide what you want to accomplish in life. What do you want to contribute to society? Where do you want to do that, and then follow that path.",2,266,135
"So, back in elementary school, I switched schools in third grade. I was put in a class with a group of people, and I had the same people in my class through fifth grade. The group of friends that I made there continued on through high school. And when we got to the college admissions process, when we were applying to colleges, a lot of them became super competitive. I'm still unsure as to the reason why they chose to become super competitive about it, but my decision was to not discuss my colleges with any of them because I didn't want people feeling bad about the decisions I made. I didn't want to share because I felt like that was more of a private thing to discuss with my family and not with my friends. For some reason, they took offense and to the point where, when I finally announced my college decision, they got really mad and they were nonchalant about it. It made me realize that even though I've had these friends for so long, they probably weren't really good friends to begin with. So I learned to let go of them and I cut contact with almost all of them now. And I'm a lot happier for it as a result.","I'm a first-year college student now, and it's been weeks since the classes started. I'm anxious because my classmates seem to know a LOT more than what I expected. I have ZERO friends (I tried to socialize, but the vibe isn't there).

It gets so lonely at lunch; I don't know how it'll pan out for me for the next 3 years of college. I can't even cry because I feel so ungrateful for the equipment and support my parents are giving me; I often feel like this is not my life to live in. Like someone out there deserves this life more than me.

I guess I hate myself somehow for not excelling in academics. I need someone, but I don't know who I need.",2,241,149
"So today was my friend, well, it wasn't my friend's birthday. It was two days before her birthday, but we decided to celebrate. So we went to this restaurant, and the restaurant was in Watertown. And I don't know if you know this, you probably don't, but Watertown is far away. So I had prepared a present for my friend. I got her this plant for her fish that she can grow and then her fish can hide in it and really enjoy it. And yeah, so I got this present prepared. It, and then I was like on my way to Watertown, taking the bus. And I was like super grumpy feeling about it because I just felt like tired and I had to rush. And then I missed my bus. And so I was just like, wait, this will probably be fun, but I'm just tired. Kind of annoyed, kind of like that. And then so I arrived there, got there right on time. I saw two of my other friends who I haven't seen in a while. And so we went into the restaurant. And my one friend was telling us about how she almost got into a car accident on her way here from New Jersey. And then the birthday girl arrived. And I gave her her present and she opened it and she really liked it because she loves her fish. And so she's really excited for it, for him. And yeah, then we got Indian food and we got like a lot of food. So I have leftovers now. And we just kind of spent the time laughing and chatting and catching up. It was kind of like old times because we're all College friends. And so it just reminds me of those College days or kind of tired and chaotic and really having, I don't know, just generally a lot of fun then. I rode back with my friend, the one who almost got in the car accident, to the train station. And I came back here and I practiced violin. And so yeah, I feel like I've got a lot done today, had fun, met up with people and I feel really good now.","About a month ago, my parents had a Birthday party. They rented a pavilion at one of the local parks and invited about 50 people. The theme to the party was ""When I'm 64"". This is a tribute to the song of the same name by the Beatles.

They had the party catered, which was really nice. There was also a lot of beer and wine. The food was excellent. The bummer was, a lot of people didn't show up. In the end, we only had about 25 guests. This made my mum kind of sad.

My stepfather got very drunk. This made my mum very mad. I won't call it very successful because not a lot of people showed up, but we had fun. We played some bingo and horseshoes. We even had a trivia contest. It went on quite late, until about 9 pm.

My sister and I were the designated drivers. We also got to take home a lot of the food.",3,432,194
"Yeah. So my sister is writing this story, and the preliminary title, or the current title, is ""Wonders for the Dead."" And it\'s a really interesting story. Her and I had talked about it and kind of brainstormed together because it\'s based off the idea of Christian missionaries. But it\'s trying to take an ethical perspective or like a thoughtful perspective on the idea of someone being a missionary and bringing the idea of like, why would someone want to be a missionary? And so I read this story today to offer some edits or some critiques. And basically, the story goes, it starts out this little girl named Annalore is on a train with her mother and her two siblings. And they are traveling from, we don\'t know exactly where, but they\'re going to a citadel. And then the train stops because they need to do some train work. And they see three undead, or how they\'re called, dead. Three of the dead behind or like the little girl sees three of the dead and they\'re wearing ragged clothes. And she asks her mother, like, ""mama, is that one of the dead?"" And her mother\'s trying to sleep, so her mother tells her like, ""Be quiet, leave me alone."" But then the dead, they race for the train, they jump into the train, and they\'re trying to find somebody to bite or somebody to eat. And then they get in, everyone\'s panicking, there\'s like a stampede. The main character was in the woman\'s train compartment and all the men run into that compartment. And they\'re hiding, they\'re trying to get away from this, obviously slam his door closed. And then there\'s just this little boy and this old man who are left there with the dead chasing them. And so the little boy manages to open a window and jumps out the window, and the old man is waving his cane at the dead, trying to get out, trying to escape. He looks back to see that the little boy\'s opened the window and then they grab him and they start biting him, ripping him to pieces. And the whole time the little girl is just watching. And like her mother told her, stay still, sit, don\'t look. And so the whole time she\'s just watching because her mother can\'t pay attention to that with everything going on. So she sees this man get killed very violently. But then the train workers come and they have guns, and they\'re like, ""you better leave this train or else we\'re going to blow you to Kingdom Come."" And so then the dead, one of them says, ""You should be scared of me. What are you doing?"" But the train records, once again, are like, ""we\'ll shoot you if you don\'t leave."" So then finally they leave, they drag the body of the old man away with them, and the girl is horrified at thinking about what she saw. And so then, flash forward, maybe like ten years later, and she\'s trying to buy a gun in the store. And the store owner asks her, like, ""Is this gun for your father?"" She tells him, ""no, this is not for my father."" He\'s, like, ""Are you sure?"" She\'s like, ""yes, because my father looks for all of his women folk, or like the women connected to him, to be well armed and taken care of."" So eventually the store owner decides, like, ""okay, fine, I\'ll sell you the gun."" And he had tried to sell her, like, a really bad gun that wasn\'t working very well because he thought as a woman that she wouldn\'t know. But she instantly knew. And so then she takes her gun, she gets all of the materials that she needs for her father, for his store. She takes it over there. And then the store clerk is kind of flirting with her, like, ""oh, you don\'t have to call me Mr. Gibson or whatever his name is. You can call me by my first name."" And she\'s like, ""that would be inappropriate."" And he\'s like, ""but is there a way that we could be close?"" And she\'s like, ""sure, whatever."" And she leaves. She runs out because she\'s like, ""I need to go and check the mail. Like, I\'m waiting for a package or a letter."" Until she gets there and the mail is late. And so everybody starts freaking out. They\'re like, ""Did the dead attack the train?"" And the Sheriff\'s like, ""no, the dead haven\'t attacked our train in ages, it\'s fine."" And she\'s like, ""yeah, but he doesn\'t know about me being attacked by the dead that time, like, ten years ago."" So finally, the mail compartment arrives, and everybody\'s excited. They raise the man, and they ask him, like, ""Wait, did the dead attack the train? It\'s all right, it\'s late."" And he\'s just, like, frozen and speechless, holding these packages. And they\'re like, ""Wait, he\'s one of the dead!"" And they start freaking out, they start panicking. And then the girl fires her rifle into the air, and she\'s like, ""you need to calm down. Like, he\'s not one of the dead. He doesn\'t have any of the signs of the dead."" And so then she goes up to the guide, she\'s like, ""okay, do you have my package from blah, blah, blah, this other city?"" And he\'s like, ""yeah, I do."" He gives it to her. And she\'s like, ""okay,"" because she\'s waiting for this response to find out if she can become a part of the lazari to help deal with the dead. And so that\'s the beginning of the story. And I thought it was a pretty interesting story. So you can tell me what you think.","On Thanksgiving Day -- that's the only day my parents would take me out to dinner -- there was this woman going through a garbage can, with her little daughter, about three or four years old picking out her Thanksgiving dinner out of a garbage can. At that point in my life, I began to think, it's not as good on this planet as I think it might be.

One of the things I wanted to do when I grew up was to try to make the world a better place. But I didn't have an awful lot of confidence getting there. Because as a Puerto Rican kid in New York going to some terrible schools, nobody ever told me as a kid that I could really amount to much at all.

But finally, I met someone who helped me and I was able to make the leap. And then when I got into college and met some professors that had some faith in me and encouraged me to go to graduate school and so on and so forth. I always pointed my life in that direction.",4,1235,204
"So yeah, so over the weekend, I not only went to get the furniture, but I also went to get some oven mitts. And it was just a really nice experience overall because I got them from Buy Nothing, which is like a site or a group on Facebook to find free things. And so, I got these oven mitts. But then the lady and I were communicating a lot. She wanted one of the candles that I was giving away. And I wanted the mitts. So, I was able to take her the candle. And she left me the mitts. And she really enjoyed the smell of the candle and stuff. We had a really nice and sweet interaction.","I had a presentation to do today, and I hate public speaking with a passion. I think I did well, but it still was nerve-wracking. I ended up going to the dollar store with my mom after class, and there was this very kind cashier there. I wanted to make her happy because that makes me happy (and I needed it after today), and because she seemed so sweet, I asked her what her favorite chocolate bar was ""because I wasn't sure what to get.""

She said, ""Wunderbar,"" so I went and got 2. I told her no bag. She asked if I wanted a receipt, so I said no thanks, and slid one of the Wunderbars across the counter towards her and said, ""and you can have one.""

Her face instantly lit up even behind her mask, and she was so thankful. It cost me $0.82 to make someone happy for a day, and that just made my entire day better. Everything I did today, including the presentation, led me to meeting this kind woman and giving her a smile (and a Wunderbar).

It just feels great. I hope she enjoyed her chocolate. It really made me feel good seeing her eyes light up like that!",3,136,246
"Yeah. So, for today, it\'s a quick story. I have been pretty tired today because I was traveling over the weekend. But going to see my friend and have some fun. And then I got back and didn\'t really have too much time to rest because I had to go to work and there\'s just been a lot of stuff going on at work. And I said, ""Because I\'ve been tired,"" it\'s been extra stressful doing those things.","I was let go from my job several months ago. I believe it's been exactly 5 months. I always thought I was really good at the job, and I really enjoyed what I was doing. I was a marketing analyst and enjoyed playing with numbers and looking for trends. I really liked helping my clients grow their companies. So, it came as a surprise when my boss told me I was being let go.

The agency I worked for was doing well financially, and they had to cut back on expenses. I knew they were having a tough time, but I never thought it would affect me. I assumed if they had to lay anyone off, it would be newer hires and not people like me who had been with the company for years.

I was really disappointed and surprised. Now I'm left trying to find a new job, but it's possible I might look into a new career path. Finding a new job hasn't been as easy as I thought it would. I have a part-time job now, and I'm struggling to pay the bills. I still have some savings left, but it's starting to dry up.

Things are starting to look pretty grim, and I'm really afraid. There's a part of me who thinks I should go back to school and try a new career, but I can't afford to go back to school. So for right now, I'm stuck, and I'm trying to figure out what to do next. Whatever it is, I have to figure out something soon.",5,94,304
"Yeah, so I think something I\'ve been thinking about lately is this book that I\'ve been reading. It\'s called ""The Way of the Wanderer,"" and basically, it\'s about a war between, I think, ten dogs. And one of the gods is the wandering God. And another god is the God of Law. And the God of Law is trying to become the only God. So, he wants to be the law. And the wandering God wants to prevent that because obviously, the wanderer doesn\'t want to be free. And so, to prevent the God of Law from becoming the only God or the ruling God, the wandering God starts uniting the tribes of people that worship him, and then also working with other gods to try and, I guess, combine their worshippers. They will be stronger than the God of Law. And so currently, in the part of the book that I\'m reading, there are these genies or one particular genie who is determined that he wants to be the best genie and the smartest. And he wants to be honored by the wandering God. And so basically, he\'s playing both sides. He\'s playing all sides to try and impress the wandering God. He\'s pitting tribe leaders against each other to try and eventually make it look like he brought everyone together. And he is trying to work with other deities, other spirits from other gods. But in the end, he\'s not that smart. And so, I think that his plans are going to fail in one way or another. But then, I also do wonder if they will, in some way, succeed because they\'re so messy that they might actually end up being good.","When I was a kid, my father used to take me to watch trials, actually, and there was something just about the whole kind of excitement and snapping victory from the jaws of defeat, the great cross-examination that brings us witness to tears.

I really think that law is an instrument for social change, and growing up, it was always part of my vision of my life that social change would be part of it.

When I wake up in the morning, one thing I know for sure is I'll be there. And if I try to find things in my life that make waking up exciting, rewarding, satisfying, then I'm gonna pursue those things in my life.",3,336,135
"So today, I had a dream and it was kind of interesting, but also very strange because I was thinking about the situation for work. And then, I was trying to work and I had the situation at work and I was really thinking about it. And so, I had this dream that my boss told me to order catering. And then, I woke up and I realized it was not happening.","I worked in technology up until 1998, in which I struck out on my own and built an engineering company. I had good contracts. 9/11 hits a couple of years later, and all of a sudden, a lot of the major corporations and people I was dealing with, their stocks fell, and they stopped giving work.

I went and became a screener at the airport. I worked for a major corporation. I'm a screener - people that were my clients and then I work with were coming through the airport.

But I stuck to my principles. I knew I was better than this. And I had a plan. So I took what I knew, even though I was working in terrorism and mass transit, I created interoperability at the 2004 Super Bowl.

And so, I knew from that, I was as good or better than anybody there.",3,81,168
"Yeah. So, as I mentioned before, I started reading this book called ""Unearthly Gorgeous"" by Ocean Vaughn, and actually, Ocean Vaughn came to my school. Actually, when I graduated, he spoke at my commencement ceremony. And reading this book made me think about the fact that if I had read this book a year ago or a year and a half ago, that when Ocean Vaughn came, I would have known him, would have known his work, and something about his life and all these very deeply personal things that he\'s written about. And I just started to wonder why I didn\'t discover this book before. But then, I started just like as I was on the train and as I was walking home, really thinking about how I feel since graduating College and all the things that I\'ve done since then, that I have changed a lot in a really quick or really short period of time. And that some of the different books and different things that have been that are just coming to me now have been postponed but I got years ago but didn\'t start. That maybe they are a part of my current change and the fact that I pick them up again is a part of my current change and will help in the growth that is to come. And yeah, I think just reading this book and the past few months, a lot of things have just been kind of impacting me in a different way. And it\'s very interesting because there\'s a lot about it that is philosophical, a lot of it that\'s mental. Some things are sad, some things that are happy. It\'s like so many things mixed up together. So, yeah, that\'s not just one story, but kind of an ongoing story of my current time.","I'm an Assistant Professor in Astronomy, and I study the dynamic universe. So what I do is, with the beautiful telescopes here at Palomar Observatory, we have some robotic telescopes that are continuously making a movie of the night sky. So we image the sky over and over again, and we look for what changed. You might go out there and think the universe is the same old thing every time, but it's actually not. It's full of these little explosions, which last for a very short amount of time, so they're very energetic. It's like cosmic fireworks lighting up our sky.

It was not at all clear that one day I would do a PhD. I grew up on a farm in India with 100 cows and fields of weeds and chickpeas. And I had left home when I was 15, and I was a girl in India in a small place. The entire community was up in arms. There were people like neighbors, relatives, you name it. People I haven't even seen before coming into the house and trying to talk my parents out of this crazy decision to send their daughter alone on this journey into the other end of the world to pursue something called Astronomy or whatever that was. The community was completely unsupportive.

In my case, the best way to deal with it was to just let that fade away in the background and not engage with it directly, but focus on what is motivating me, on what is giving me joy and just let everything else fade away in the background.",3,348,301
"Okay. So this is the only story I can think of, and hopefully it\'ll be a little interesting to you, Jivo. So basically, I met this guy on a train platform a few days ago, and he walked up to me and he said something like, ""Hi, how are you doing?"" And then somehow segued the conversation to talking about the difficulty of finding community in Boston. I think he said something like, ""Oh, this is where I\'m from, blah, blah."" And then we got on the train, traveled a little bit, and he\'s like, ""Oh, you know, we should chat again as I\'m getting off."" Okay, he\'s pretty interesting. So then, a few days ago, we got lunch and chatted for an hour or two. And I had already sent, like, ""Oh, maybe this guy is kind of approaching me because he thinks I\'m attractive in some way, just physically."" And we did have some things, some overlaps or something that are common or shared. But he would always move from the things that I was most interested in to talking about what he seemed to be most interested in sharing. And now, he is trying to get me to hang out with him, and we met less than a week ago. So, I\'m currently in a place of trying to figure out how to be kind to another person and treat them well without feeling like I owe them anything or have a certain responsibility to do or say or give anything that I don\'t want to. Yeah, so that\'s a story for my week.","I started talking to a guy that I've always noticed and got along outstandingly with, and I realized that I might have been stifling feelings for him this entire time because I really just haven't been in the best situation recently. 

But we really started talking, like really talking about our lives and future plans. This was two days ago, and then at the end of the day (we had been talking on Snapchat), he put a little thing on the bottom of his snap that said, ""I think you're cute"" but in German. So naturally, I was like, ""I think you're cute too,"" and we talked until 12 that night. I woke up to a good morning from him. 

Once we both had free time that day, we just talked and I couldn't help but fall for him a little bit more. We were talking earlier, too, just about the small things: my dad passed away recently, his service is tomorrow, and the guy is going through some rough stuff in his family right now, so I just tried to make him feel better. 

And then he said he thought he was in love with me. I said that I really liked him too, but I think we have issues with ourselves we really need to work out before we can pursue something like that. I adore him, though, and I really hope I didn't mess anything up. 

We agreed to just be there for each other, to be friends as best we could, and just go from there in life. I don't know him very well yet, so I really respect that decision, and frankly, I'm just excited! This is the first serious thing I've had with a guy. 

In any case, I'm just happy that I have someone like him in my life if we end up as friends or something else.",4,324,369
"Sure. This morning, I had a really frustrating experience with my partner who is afraid of needles, which means that he is uncomfortable getting blood drawn and has not gotten blood drawn or lab work done in several years since he was a child, and now he's an adult. So he really should do that. I went through the trouble of trying to figure out an at-home option to just do a few drops of blood and test, like most of the things that need to be tested. But he struggled to do it this morning and was also very grumpy and cranky about it. I felt sort of frustrated because I'm not like the bad guy here. I'm an adult, and it's important for you to take care of your health. So I don't really understand why I'm like the sort of villain of the story.","We've been friends for a while, not a super long time, but long enough for me to really value his opinion. I hadn't mentioned my autism because I get anxious about people reacting negatively to it, but he didn't! And I knew he wouldn't!

It came about by me telling him what a tough time I've been having recently with managing my symptoms, and it sparked a great conversation of him trying to help with a problem and then telling me fun stories about his other autistic friends.

It was a great part of a bad day!",2,166,111
"Okay. The story I'd like to tell is about setting boundaries at work. I think that the last few days, I've been struggling with working with people who are not necessarily either totally in tune with my responsibilities as a consultant or people who are just, like, sort of frazzled and pushing responsibility onto me. And I think that I've been feeling like I need to set better boundaries or I need to be clearer with myself about what those expectations are. Like, whether it's okay to scope research without an expectation of being paid for those hours, whether I need to price that into future work, or whether that's just something that I need to set better boundaries about.","I met with my supervisor and Human Resources in the afternoon to go over my options after the performance improvement plan. They suggested either accepting a voluntary demotion out of the administrative and leadership roles that I had been involved in for over 12 years, or proceed to a pre-disciplinary hearing on the situation. 

That night, I had to face some of my avoidant behaviors. I had been hiding the severity of the situation not just from myself but also my partner and had to go home and break down about the entire thing. I sat on the floor and freaking melted down in shame and sorrow about the entire situation. 

When I explained as much as I could about what had been going on and that on a daily basis, I 'thought I had it. I thought it was under control. I was fixing it. And I didn't want to bother"" her. Her response was immediate. She told me in no uncertain terms that while I was sorry because I didn't want to worry her about it, I SHOULD have been sorry about thinking I had to go through it by myself. That lifted a huge weight. 

Six weeks later, I'm still reckoning with the effect of that conversation on me emotionally. I'm able to have more conversations with her about it. We're stronger than we were before.",5,136,255
"I have recently been going through a bit of a reckoning with a close friend of mine from college. So, we met 10-12 years ago. And he lives in a different city. And we haven't spent a ton of time together recently. Though we have spent a lot of time talking on the phone and recently we spent a week together traveling. And I realized that the way that he has started, or maybe has always sort of spoken about women, really was off-putting to me. And I had a conversation with him about it. And he was very defensive and did not necessarily seem to think that there was a problem, and instead sort of turned it around on me and said that I'm being really conservative or Puritan or whatever it is. When in reality, I think I was just asserting that women deserve respect and to not be spoken about like objects. And yeah, I haven't spoken to him since, a month or six weeks. It was probably always happening. We've always disagreed on how he treats people and how he doesn't necessarily extend the same respect or reciprocity to them as they do to him.","I got harassed by my dad. It used to be just him messaging me, asking me for pictures of me. I had a bad gut feel about it, so I would often ignore or avoid it. Then he moved on to saying, ""I'm in the bathroom doing you know what"" and ""This parking is nice, you can do whatever you want, and no one will see.""

Last night I was at my parents' house, and I was half-woken up by a touch on my leg. I don't know if it actually happened, but I think it did.

I don't know what to do because I feel bad for my mom. I want to cut off ties with him, but I can't do that without hurting my mom. She's a housewife with no job and savings, so if I tell her the truth, she'll leave, and life will be tough. I don't make enough for both of us to be comfortable. I'm not even sure she'll believe me.",3,223,203
"Yeah. I've been having a couple of really frustrating experiences at work with a specific person. Who I feel, like, is very sort of toxic in the way that they operate. But also, I don't know whether it's just, like, poor social skills or just a lack of care for others, a lack of empathy. They will set up meetings that don't have any agendas. They'll sort of discredit or devalue other people's experiences or opinions. They are very territorial. It's very hard for them to acknowledge other people's contributions, I guess, or work well with other people that they feel are threatening. And yeah, we had a meeting recently that was the person that was bringing together a team of people who don't work on the same team anymore, but it's sort of like a power grab for them to still be considered like the head of this sort of discipline of research. And they spent the entire meeting just making everyone else anxious about how our new director, essentially, asked this person whether we do a review of quantitative research before it goes out or not. And so this person communicated that out to our team with no purpose other than just to spread his sort of anxiety out to other people. And then basically had no updates on that, since I think probably because it wasn't a real thing that anyone should be concerned about. But it was framed as this sort of, like, urgent conversation that our team needs to have. And yeah, I just have been feeling frustrated about that.","Today was a terrible day for me. My coworker, who we will call the big ""W,"" is usually always mean to me. However, today she was the worst. It was our big Christmas party, and she micromanaged everyone at work today. She started openly complaining about only she was smart, only she did any real work, etc.

Everyone had told me since I started here how terrible she was and how badly they wanted her to be fired. Despite this, no one would ever do anything about her or talk about her until she left the room.

Finally, I snapped and decided not to sit down and take it like everyone else. While she started insisting she told me to do something I was never told, I told her to her face she never said that. She lost it and started to scream at me, while she did that my boss just ignored it like he usually did.

I decided I had enough of a boss that wouldn't do anything and handed him my resignation, which was more than he deserved. He tried to convince me it was cowardly to leave, but I told him it was cowardly to not fire her.

She kept harassing me through the night until that point, then my boss decided to take her to the back room and yell at her for having a coworker finally quit over her. She came back out and stayed quiet for the whole rest of the night.

I left that job and felt good about leaving. They all already didn't like her, but it was made worse once she actually cost them a good employee who at least tried their best, which was more than half of the people they hired did.",2,306,329
"I have a friend who just found out that our manager has been doing something that she doesn't appreciate, which is that she asked him about mid-year promotions and he told her that they weren't doing mid-year promotions. And then today she found out that actually, someone else got promoted. So she's very upset and she thinks that our manager should have done a better job sort of advocating for her and protecting her and just sort of being on her team, versus kind of toeing the line of what comes from above him.","About 5 months ago, I quit my good job up in Virginia, sold my home, and moved back down to Florida. It all started out 4 years ago when my Uncle, who owns a couple of event planning companies, asked me to come work for him since his main company just received a huge contract from the federal government. I said yes right away and quit my job as an assistant manager at a hotel and left for Virginia to work for him. He offered to let me stay in his basement, which was just a really nice downstairs apartment. I was very grateful and stayed with him for a year until I saved enough money to get into my own place.

At first, I really enjoyed the job and put in my best effort. The two owners, my Uncle and his best friend, were very happy with my performance. I was given a 50% raise after only six months on the job. After a year, I was promoted and given another significant raise.

After being promoted, I was put under the supervision of a new boss. She was very good at her job but unfortunately was not good with the people working under her. She would talk very badly behind our backs and would not think twice about throwing us under the bus if it would keep her from looking bad. I worked for her for a couple of years until finally I and a few others had had enough.

I complained to my Uncle and his best friend, who was also my old supervisor. They did not believe that she was such a problem. My work ethic started to decline because I was very discouraged by it all. I started to not take things seriously and then began to spiral out of control to a certain extent. I was not the only one on the team with this issue.

Finally, I tried to quit several times but was guilted into staying on the job. Then, over the course of one week, I purposely did not show up for a few days until they were forced to fire me. It was a hard thing to deal with considering how my uncle, who I was very close to, looked out for me in several ways, and because of that, we became very close.

The fallout was not pleasant, and because of it all, the relationship between me and my uncle is now severely strained, and I will never work for him again.",5,103,467
"So, my partner's niece has been really struggling lately. She was an inpatient at a psychiatric treatment for about a year, and she just went home about a week ago. And we have been working on, well, not her father, and everyone else who's there is sort of working on trying to help her transition back into sort of outpatient life. But she seems to be really struggling - sort of having anxiety and depression, and sort of these angry outbursts of irritation, and just sort of general, like, not doing well. Yeah, I guess I don't really have much of a story with an arc. I guess we're in the middle of the story. But that's what I've been thinking about a lot lately.","I know there are a lot of negative experiences for people, especially those struggling with mental health issues. Though, I do not want to scare people away from getting help when they need it. I needed help at the beginning of freshman fall, so I went to medical, and they did more than enough for me. 

I genuinely look forward to seeing my psychologist, and my psychiatrist is a great person too. Both continuously make the best decisions for me, and I cannot thank them enough for all of their help. 

So for all the people out there who need help but aren’t because they’re worried about having a bad experience, it’s worth the risk. I really hope that those who have had bad experiences do get the help they need. 

But long story short, going to medical for mental health has been great for me, and especially to the prefrosh who might be reading these, please do give them a chance. They do want what’s best for you, even if some of them aren’t the best at coming to good solutions. 

This is a really long post and realistically not coherent, but I hope I got my point across. And again, to those who had bad experiences, I’m so sorry.",3,148,249
"Hello. On Wednesday, I went to a senior center and packed lunches for seniors who can't leave their home easily. And then this week, I started delivering meals to those people, and it's been really lovely. It's made me feel really good about myself.","I was grocery shopping a few weeks ago. I had purchased my items and was leaving the store. I noticed an older woman with a cart of groceries. She was walking home and was trying to figure out a way to carry all of her bags. I live across the street from the grocery store, so I told myself I should offer some assistance to her. 

I approached her and offered my help. I told her I would drop my things off at home and come back to help her carry some things. She lived nearby as well. So I did exactly that. I dropped my things off at home and came back to the store to help her carry her bags to her home. 

She was very appreciative of my help. She wanted to give me a cake she had made, and I declined. Instead, we talked for a few minutes, exchanged names and phone numbers, and laughed about the oddities of life. We had a good time together. 

I learned that she lived alone at home, so grocery shopping or shopping of any kind is a challenge. I told her we could go for coffee sometime as a thank you. I felt good about helping her. I think it's important to help others when we are able, and I was able to help her. 

I wanted to help her. She's a lovely woman, and now we are friends. She knows she can count on me to help if she needs it. I visit with her once a week. We have coffee at her home, out on her patio, or in a coffee shop and just talk. 

I have helped her plant flowers and other items. She started a garden this summer, and I help her with that as well.",4,54,339
"Yesterday, my daughter's birthday party. We invited 13 kids and some parents of them. And we had a fun time with them.","On May 21 of this year (2019), my very first niece had her 15th birthday celebration. Since she was a little baby, I was waiting for this moment, because she has a personality that makes me feel like I have my sister back when she was young. That is because of several reasons. My sister is no longer with us, and she is like the memory we have about my sister.

Now, why that date was so important for me? Well, I am not exactly in my home country. I am living abroad because of my career, but for that date, I wanted to jump from my place to her place, just because I cannot miss that once-in-a-lifetime event for my niece. I bought a flight ticket; I had a layover for about 12 hours in another country; I got sick because of the meal, but you know what? I don't regret it at all.

At the end of the day, I saw her face. I saw how happy she was in her party celebration, and also she was happy to see me there. I could dance with my little niece, who is my little baby as well, and I will remember that for the rest of my life.

I said to her that when I was in the airplane, I saw her mother in the sky. She told me to carry her and said, ""I love you"" on behalf of her. My niece was so happy. She hugged me, and I whispered, ""Your mother is so proud of you, honey."" I am pretty sure my sister was also dancing in heaven.

The night was too short, but the memories are infinite because each second was valuable. I have to travel back the next day, without anything in my bags, but my heart full of love. Family is the treasure that will always make your life valuable.",1,27,369
"I have our big leftover from yesterday\'s birthday party. And I thought, okay. I was going to bring this box of pizza to homeless people. Maybe they are hungry. But it reminded me of a certain period of time ago. I saw a homeless man holding a sign. ""I am hungry"" and ""help me"". ""God bless you"". And so I didn\'t have cash. I passed him but I went to a pizza store and got a slice or two of pizza for him and came back to him. And handed the pizza off to him, but he said, ""oh, okay. I\'m good. Too much pizza"". So I gave him the small cash that my husband had. At that time, I didn\'t have cash, but my husband did. Usually, I feel good when I think I am doing good. But that time, I didn\'t feel not so much good because I went to the pizza store for him. Of course, I didn\'t ask him if he wanted pizza, but I did. So I expected him to say thank you and accept that slice of pizza. But I noticed that the way I wanted to treat the person was not the way he wanted to be treated. I can\'t expect to be said thank you. Yeah, I would take the pizza from yesterday\'s birthday party. It reminded me of that memory.","Usually, if I see a homeless person, I'll stop by the closest fast food joint and pick them up a meal or something and then continue on my way home. I know most people are skeptical of that kind of thing, but my rule of thumb is I'd rather get scammed out of a $10-15 meal than let someone go without a meal if I have the means to help.

So yesterday, I was driving home from work, and I see the woman holding a sign saying she recently lost her job and anything would help. A few feet away were her kids, ranging from around six to around 16. I did my usual and picked up some fast food. I spent a little more than usual because of the kids, around $30 total.

When I dropped it off, she gave me the biggest, happiest smile I have ever seen. All I did was give her and her kids some chicken and soda, but she was so grateful for just that. I've never seen someone's eyes light up the way hers did when I handed her that food.

It really made me think how lucky I am. I mean, I complain about my parents like every teen does, but these kids had been sitting in the sun for at least a couple of hours and were just so appreciative for two meals to share. I thought I was helping them out, but they're the ones who helped me by showing how it's the little things we need to be grateful for.",4,274,294
"My daughter, Lena, went to a bakery walk shop yesterday. She made two kinds of pastry up there: a sweet one and a savory one. The sweet one was Turbulen, Blackberry, and the savory one was cheese and potato. Both are delicious. It was a two-hour session, but actually it took almost 3 hours. So when I went to pick her up, the kids were still waiting for their baked goods. So while I was waiting for the kids, I utilized that time to chat with other parents. But my son was super tired and hungry after his swimming lesson. So I had to stop chatting and began to entertain him. But after all, the gallant was so tasty and my daughter was so enjoying the time. And she was so proud of what she did. So I think $85 was worth it. I think it was a good experience for her, for me too.","There's this woman that goes around town who sells beauty products, clothes, cleaning products, small appliances, and pretty much anything a small business can offer. I was paying for the product I bought from her, and she just randomly said I looked good in my leggings and I looked long-legged.

For someone who's been bullied throughout my childhood for how I looked, this made my heart flutter. She just gave me the confidence to wear leggings out in public.",3,179,91
"So, a few days ago, I got letters from my mom. She apologized for what she did to me when I was a kid. I don't want to mention the specific detail of what she did, but she was too focused on something over me, and it was more than 30 years ago. So, I'm still suffering from it. I'd like to accept the apology, but I don't know what to say, or how to deliver the message. The problem is she always apologizes about that, but that's it. She doesn't try to fix it or compensate for it. And of course, we cannot go back to the past. We live now, but I think we can still fix it. There is still a way to mitigate the issue. Except for that issue, we've been getting along and I love her. I understand no one is perfect, but sometimes I feel if she was so bad, I wish I could hate her. I know this is a very childish, teenager-ish idea, but it is true that I feel that way sometimes. And after that, after I feel so bad, I feel guilty to have failed. I don't want her to apologize to me about that anymore.","I hate my mistakes. I hate the fact I made these mistakes. And I feel like I'll hate myself for it for the rest of my life.

I've been around plenty of people. I wouldn't say they were all completely normal. Half the time, my friend groups would get into drama and I'd get scooped up into it, and we'd all act like we were fine. I've made a lot of mistakes. A lot of the people I had around damaged me emotionally and psychologically. But that doesn't excuse the fact I did that to others too.

I've gotten out of those toxic friendships. And I've gotten better and even made new friendships, but word gets around, you know? It doesn't get to me, and I never had any reason to believe that other people would talk bad about me, but I have a gut feeling people are saying things about me. It's killing me.

I've done my best to try to amend my past mistakes, but that doesn't mean people forget. God knows I haven't forgotten what other people did to me. I've been better now, really. But I believe when you're around toxic people, you do toxic things, and even though that's no excuse for my behavior, I kinda hope it helps other people understand why I did what I did.

I've reconciled with myself, but I feel bad for getting this feeling that others probably don't care if I'm sorry. And that's understandable. I've tried to let go, and I thought everything was fine, but people hold grudges longer than I do.

I understand why I did what I did. But I also understand that I hurt people the same way they hurt me, and I regret that so much. I feel like my life is being sewn together and ripped apart every time I try to heal from my mistakes. It's annoying.

I hate myself. I know mistakes are human, but I hate the fact that I feel like people hate me.",2,247,401
"So yesterday, I took my daughter to her swimming lesson. She has been taking private lessons for a couple of weeks and she was so scared of the water. She was not able to go under the water, but now she can swim, although she cannot breathe unless she can hold her breath. She can continue swimming until that time when she needs to breathe. So, it is very impressive improvement. I'm so proud of her.","My wife and I had been teaching my son how to ride his bike for quite a while. He was having trouble learning. We started out with the traditional style of the parent holding the seat and the handlebars while the child pedals. We ran several days of trials this way. It was hard for my son to realize the mechanics.

I would hold the seat, and he would begin to lean into me. He wouldn't try to adjust himself but would rely on me to keep him upright. It wasn't working.

I looked online for some suggestions. This was a first for both my wife and me. I found one post advising to have the child sit on the seat and walk the bike themselves, then when they have enough momentum, start pedaling.

This method made total sense to me. It seemed to teach them the natural motions while still being safe. My son tried this method a few times. He was starting to get the balance down that he needed.

He finally walked it out and began to pedal. He went the length of the driveway, and now he is a full-fledged bike rider. It was one of the proudest moments of my life.",3,88,230
"Yesterday, my daughter and her friend made their first ever lemonade stand. Together, her mom (I mean, the friend's mom) helped them. She helped them make lemonade, create a sign for it, and even got text messages from the mother. So, I went to the town and the lemonade was super delicious. I was so proud of them.","I was born in Lima, Peru, and I came to the US when I was 5 years old. I remember being a kid, and seeing my aunt and my grandmother clean homes. They all cleaned different homes. And sometimes they'd clean these beautiful homes. You'd always think, ""Wow, I wish I could live in a home like this."" And so, seeing them work so hard, I think instilled a kind of good work ethic in me.

I became a US citizen at 21. It gave me a huge sense of love of country and love of this country, and I knew then that I wanted to do more to give back. I'm the youngest mayor of any big city in the US. And having to deal with the fact, I was trying to prove myself because of my age, that I can do this job, and yes, I'm gay, that provides some challenges.

But for me, the part that defines me the most, besides being young or being gay, is being an immigrant because immigrants don't have easy lives here. And I think sometimes there's a lot of conversation about immigrants and their contributions to this country, and I think the contributions are incredible.

Here I am 15, 20 years later, I'm a mayor of a big city. That's an immigrant that got a chance, and there are so many other immigrants out there that want the same chances.",1,72,283
"So this weekend, I went on a short trip, just a day trip, to a city called Kernel by the sea. I was recommended to visit the city by one of my friends, and she was saying the city is really cute. And yeah, she liked their citizens. She has visited the city several times so far, so I did too. And yeah, it was a cute, beautiful city. There were lots and lots of people inside, sightseeing and shopping. And the city is full of art, so there are many art galleries. That is something I am not so familiar with, but I stopped by several galleries. And yeah, it was a nice trip. And also, I went to a nice restaurant, a Greek restaurant, and the kids wanted to go. So they were a bit bored besides seeing the city. But there was a plate named Flaming Cheese. So they put the cheese on the pan and pour rum or some alcohol and let it catch fire. And yeah, it was surprising for them. Yeah, overall, it was a nice day trip.","I recently took one of the best trips of my life. I went on vacation this summer to NYC. I have always wanted to travel to New York. I have had dreams of going there since I was a little kid. I majored in finance in college, so seeing the biggest financial district in the world was incredible. I went on a tour of Wall Street and took a picture with the infamous bull.

There are so many things to do in NYC, and my best friend and I made the most of our time. We went on a ferry ride to go see the Statue of Liberty. We went and saw the memorial for the twin towers. One of my favorite moments was when we went to a rooftop bar and were hanging out with a perfect view of the skyline.

The only negative thing about NYC is the prices. It was like $15 for a cocktail. I knew it would be expensive there, but it was crazy. Another plus about the city is that there is world-class dining pretty much everywhere you go. You could eat world-class dining or you could get a hot dog from a cart, and either way, the food was delicious.

If it wasn't so expensive to live there, I would definitely want to move. The city life is for me.",4,217,252
"Okay, I am taking on MBA course and in the course, I am currently taking Professional Communication Management. But the instructors and the assistance of them are not so professional. In their communications, for instance, they are teaching to respond chat pretty quickly. But what they're doing is they respond to chat message four days after that the message I send so it is a little frustrating.","Engineering was exciting to me because it was the creation process of going from an idea to ""I've made this"" or ""This is a better way of doing it.""

We opened up the directory of industrial designers. And we just started cold calling down the list to try to get interviews. We had just graduated from college, so we didn't really know anything about their daily work, so we just asked them to tell us, ""So what do you do? Show us where you work. What kind of projects are you working on? What are the problems?""

And one of the patterns was, people had a hard time finding new materials. Finding suppliers, finding how to use it, finding what are the options. It's a whole can of worms that they just didn't know how to do.

I really wanted to realize my maximum potential, and I felt if I just took a job somewhere, then I wouldn't be able to realize it. It would just be whatever they gave you to do.

Today, if you want to build something, the barriers to try are very low. And it really comes back to effort and desire.",4,76,231
"So, staying with positive things, I guess I was thinking about the other night when my team in high school won the basketball state championship in Texas. It was a really big deal for me. And something that I realized is that this happened over 13 years ago. But I realized something that carried through, that I learned somehow along the way playing basketball from that game. I remember feeling somewhat shocked when we won it. And everyone around me, all my other teammates, were jumping up and down, kind of crying, and excited. I, on the other hand, was a little bit more in disbelief and somewhat like, ""Oh, okay, we won."" I wasn\'t as externally excited as everyone else. And I just played in a tennis tournament with a team that I have now in my adult life, and the same thing is true. When I win something, I\'m kind of like, ""Okay, yeah, let\'s keep going."" And everybody else around me is jumping up and down. It\'s just a very interesting thing to think about that. I\'ve always sort of been, I guess, focused and not as excitable externally as other people around me.","Today I took my dad to the Game 7 watch party for the Stanley Cup. It was an away game, so we couldn't go to the actual game, but we had the next best thing in watching it at the stadium with 20 thousand other fans. My dad said he didn't want to go since he couldn't handle the stress of the game, but I surprised him with tickets anyways.

This was a big deal for me since my dad is the reason I am into hockey, and he had been watching the Blues his whole life, and they have never won it. I knew he would regret it if he just stayed home watching the game alone instead of having the chance to be downtown if we actually won it.

It was a stressful start of the game, but luckily we scored first and never looked back. We looked like a team on a mission, and that mission was to bring the Stanley Cup to our town for the first time ever. I could see my dad got a little more happy and less stressed with each goal we scored, like he was starting to believe we might actually do it.

I was also freaking out inside because I knew we had been close before but always got let down, and anything can happen in sports. It's never over until the final horn sounds, so in the back of our minds, we kept thinking the worst.

When they actually did it, we went crazy with all the other people at the stadium, but also I could see my dad crying a little. It brought me joy to know how happy he was in this moment, and I was glad I was here to share it with him.

This is something we will continue to talk about for years to come, and we will always know where we were when it happened. He brought me to a Game 7 in the World Series when I was young, so this was also a way for me to repay the favor, but I hope to repay it again sometime in our lifetime with an actual game ticket.

To be in that stadium, though, when the whole city felt like they won was a great memory to have and one that I will be forever grateful I shared with my dad.",2,237,436
"So, I was kind of looking at old pictures but also thinking about pictures from my childhood. And my mom is really embarrassed about herself. She's always been, ever since I can remember. And it's funny because a lot of times in old pictures, I'll see my sister and I or my sister and other people in our family. But it's always weird seeing my mom in old pictures because it's so rare. And it's also rare, a little weird feeling, remembering that person who she was because she was so pretty and so young. Very, very young, but also so tormented. Just she has a lot of depression and anxiety. And I didn't know what it was as a kid. And I remember just not realizing how the situation I was in until getting out and looking back. So, seeing these old pictures of my sister and I kind of just, it's funny to see. It just makes me feel grateful for my sister, for being there when it was a little bit difficult but also just, I feel a little bit lucky that that little girl that was me in the pictures had no idea. I didn't try to wrap my head too far around the struggles that my mom was going through. And I kind of just picked up and treaded through all of her stuff that she was trying to put on me. And now I'm a stronger person for it. But looking back at pictures with seeing her in them and knowing what she used to say about herself, and it was totally not true, and especially looking back now, it's just a very interesting feeling to see that.","I feel I'm not enough for Ella. I feel that I'm so worthless and useless and not good enough for her. She is so much more than me. I see nothing in myself, and I feel I've been dragging her down with my sadness. Lately, I haven't been doing well and I'm sorry for not voicing out. It's extremely hard for me to speak up because I've never had anyone care for me and my feelings. I've always bottled up how I felt and never talked about it. Every night I lay in bed thinking about where I'm gonna be, and it always ends up with me dead.

She is what gives me motivation and drives me to be a better person. Without her, I have no idea where I would be. My parents and I have never been on a close enough level to talk about our feelings. I feel if I tell them I will be viewed differently and looked down upon. I hate this, but there's not much I can do. 

When she found out about how I really felt, I felt relief and better. I felt as if a million bricks were taken off my shoulder. When she told me my sister found out, my heart dropped. I was so scared she was gonna think that I'm not some tough guy and just some softie. But it wasn't all that bad. 

Every day I struggle with my looks. I hate my hair, my voice, my face, my personality. I hate me. I don't know what she sees in me. I have no friends, no social life. There are days where I wish I don't wake up. I wish a bus would hit me. Some days I feel nothing. I may be in bed wanting to cry, but nothing happens. I can't even cry, and sometimes that's what I need. Whenever I hear someone laugh, I always think it's about me. I'm just a loser. 

I think I'm in love with Ella. I always want to be with her and see a bright future if she stays with me. I can see some little kids running around the house and us cooking dinner. I think it would be amazing to be in her future. I've never felt love, but I think Ella is showing me. She has been bringing me to social events and getting me in there. I love it.",1,325,478
"So, when I was in elementary school, I was a very active kid and independent. I would run around the neighborhood and ring people's doorbells, ask my friends to play, and was not afraid to go and do these things by myself.\n\nI had a friend. I had several friends move away, but I had one friend in particular that moved away when I was in, I believe it was the fourth grade. And we had just recently completed this activity called Flat Stanley, where you sent this flat... we read this story about a boy who was flattened and was shipped all around to visit people. I can't remember the exact story, but what we did is we then would send the Flat Stanley to somebody.\n\nSo that made it me fascinated with this idea of mail. And so when my friend moved away in the fourth grade, we became pen pals, which was fun. And I remember being so excited to get these handwritten letters and how exciting it was to just send a letter off and be anticipating the next one coming back around. We could have called each other, but we were in fourth grade and the mail was much more exciting. And I just remember how excited I was to be able to get a piece of mail.","I was part of a military family. We moved a lot. I went to ten schools before I got out of high school. My family and the military community around us were part of my life. And also the Catholic church. 

At that time, for girls, the idea was if you weren't just gonna be a mom and a mother, there were really very few things you could do. You could be a nurse. You could be a teacher. And in my background, you could be a nun. I very quickly decided I wasn't gonna be a nun. 

I was 17. I'm just looking at the next four years. When I became involved in the Young Lawyers here in Denver, I certainly did not think that 28 years later I would become the president of the ABA. 

If you have passion for something, there's not such a thing as a 40-hour work week. I don't think I've ever done a 40-hour work week. Because I have so much fun doing what I do, it's just part of my life.",2,244,211
"Okay. So my first summer when I went to Rhode Island School of Design. With a D. Was so fun. I was in for a master\'s of architecture. But. I had to do a summer program since my background wasn\'t in my bachelor\'s, wasn\'t in architecture. And it wasn\'t architecturally related, but it was probably my favorite part of RISD, because we took all of the foundation courses. With the transfer students that were going to be sophomores. And I painted this massive. It was like eight feet by eight feet. Painting for one of the finals, and it was supposed to be like based off an amoeba. But really I just liked it because the colors were blue. My sister liked it, so I gave the painting to my sister. Right before I guess she had graduated medical school, and I was moving into an apartment in New Jersey. And she wanted to hang up the painting. And so it was like right before I left. For. Some. I forgot what it was, but I think I was going somewhere for the summer. I helped her hang it up in her apartment. And it was really funny because my sister, usually she\'s older than me, and she\'s always kind of been like a second mom. So she\'s always been very bossy. And this time around, she doesn\'t know what we\'re supposed to be doing to hang it. And so I was just very patient and calm with trying to give directions on how we were going and explaining it before we actually did it. Instead of having us trying to hang this eight foot painting and like yelling at each other. And the funniest thing is after we hung it, she was like, ""Oh. You are really good at giving directions. I would definitely listen to you. You\'re so calm and nice."" And I was like, ""Yeah, whenever I\'m in charge, I\'m actually pretty clear and patient with people."" So it\'s kind of a funny memory.","I was working at a florist in Vancouver because I didn't know what I wanted to do. I wanted to be a photographer. But I didn't get the job at the photographer's, and I got the job at the florist's. Victoria Magazine used to be my favorite magazine when I was doing flowers. And it was all very womanly and entrepreneurial and inspiring. 

So I sent them an email and invited them for blueberry pie and tea. Because I thought it would get promotion for my wedding business. The lady that came, she was so nice. And she was like, ""Oh, you should be a stylist."" I said, ""Well, what is that?"" And she goes, ""Well, it's what you did. You make these little scenes all around your yard."" 

It was an accident. I fell into it. I didn't know it was a job. You never know where you're gonna go or what you're gonna do. Your life just keeps getting taken in these different directions.",2,397,207
"So, my parents have never, ever gotten along. They knew each other for a year, ended up finding out they were pregnant with my sister, and got married. Probably shouldn\'t have. Then had me two years later. And then pretty much were never happy with each other and I just remember one particular night where they were fighting. They would have these really brutal fights where they would just yell at the top of their lungs at each other. And sometimes it would get physical. And I was in, I think, first grade. And I woke up to one of these fights.\n\nAnd I got out of the top bunk of my bed, walked out into the living room, and saw my dad on top of my mom, biting her. And then I went back to my room because I was scared. I mean, and they were equally yelling at each other. And then I heard a loud noise. And more yelling, and I walked out, and my mom had run into a room, locked herself in there, and my dad had punched the door. And I asked him what was going on. And he bent down and was like, ""It\'s okay, Madison, go back to bed."" And I was like, ""Why did you punch the door?"" And he was like, ""It\'s okay."" There was clearly a hole in it. It was really scary. And I just went back to bed.\n\nLots of these situations happened when I was a kid. Something that my sister and I have come to discover through therapy and talking is that the reason we\'re not so mad at our dad as much as we are at mom. It\'s because mom. She would instigate a lot of these fights. I don\'t think my dad should have been doing a lot of these things either, but I think the reason that I hold more of a grudge towards my mom is because she took it out on us, and my dad never did. And my dad was equally violent and shouldn\'t have been. But my mom, when they did finally divorce and separate and my dad moved out, my mom started treating us how she treated my dad. And it took a lot of therapy to not feel like it was my fault.","My mom has done so much for me. But she also has done a lot of bad. A lot that's hurt me. I hope she can see that I was always trying to look out for her. I hope she knows that I didn't like the men she brought home because they were mean to me. I hope she knows that I wanted her to be happy.

I hope she knows I didn't lie about him pissing on my bed. I hope she knows I didn't lie about him threatening to kill me. I hope she knows I never lied about him drinking vodka as soon as he woke up. I hope she knows I was scared for my life.

I hope she knows I tried to help when he hit her. I hope she knows I wanted to forgive her. I hope she knows I did all I could to explain and excuse your actions.

But I was my own mother. I had to deal with all of her feelings and all of her burdens; she made them mine. I was alone. I never had friends. She knew I, as a 15-year-old, was in a relationship with a 24-year-old man. She offered to fly me to him. She was a bad mom.

And I will never forgive her.",3,445,247
"Yeah, so actually, yesterday I always, whenever I go out with my mom, she\'s always super negative, I realized. And won\'t go to counseling, won\'t try to make herself better. And she\'s always on edge. So I always come into interacting with her, kind of on the defense because she\'s going to be super negative. She\'s going to talk over me. She\'s going to either try to get attention with poor, pitiful me stories. And yesterday, we went to dinner. I was a little defensive. She tried to jump in and she tried to talk over me. And at one occasion, I just kept talking for like 10 seconds until she finally stopped talking and then was like, ""Oh, what were you saying?"" And it\'s like, well, I was not finished talking. But I was trying to stay calm and not mean. I mean, I got a new job, that was a big deal. She asked one question about it and then tried to make the whole dinner about her. And I intentionally didn\'t ask her questions about her job, about teaching because that\'s all she has, and that\'s all she talks about, and it\'s always negative. And I don\'t have the headspace for it. And then I started trying to tell a story that included my boyfriend and her, and she just jumped in and tried to tell a version of it that she remembers, which was not true. And I kind of was like, ""Okay, never mind. I was trying to tell a funny story, and you just ruined it."" So she was also kind of defensive about that. But at the end, she came over to my house to see my table and asked me to walk her out to her car. And I tried to just walk her to the door because she does this thing where she always has to have attention. She\'ll try to pull you off to the side and only isolate you from the crowd, so she can have attention, and it\'s just drives me crazy. So I was like, ""Okay."" She\'s like, ""You\'re not going to walk me to my car."" It\'s like, ""Okay, then."" She\'s like, ""What\'s wrong?"" And I pretty much told her that it\'s hard to have a conversation with her whenever she\'s negative, and she just immediately started crying, which is really annoying because I feel like she puts all of her happiness on me and requires me to be her therapist. And I just can\'t do that anymore because it\'s exhausting. So we ended up- I mean, I\'m proud of how I handled it because I stayed calm. But we had to have this conversation where she\'s crying in front of my house and trying to tell me that I\'m being mean. And I told her specific examples of where she acts like she\'s pitying herself. And then I finally did tell her I was like, ""Honestly, for us to have a relationship, it\'s like, I don\'t want to be your counselor."" And I\'m angry. I used to be angry at you for how you treated me as a kid, but I\'m over that because I did the work. But now I\'m angry because I\'m angry that you have all these opportunities to make yourself better and be happy and you don\'t want to do it. And it\'s annoying to watch, and it\'s really hard. And I don\'t want to be your therapist. I cannot be your therapist."" And she just cried. And then today, she sent me a text message that was like, kind of putting some of it on me about how I don\'t want to see her, but I keep these boundaries. And she complains about the boundaries. And then whenever I do tell her, give her an honest truth, she says, ""We need to take space."" So I don\'t know, I\'m really annoyed with her. She\'s just always done this for my entire life. And I\'m kind of done with it. And it makes me scared that she\'ll kill herself sometimes. I was afraid to let her go home, but also she\'s always pestering me for answers, and the reality of it is that she doesn\'t want to make herself happy or get better. I\'m lucky I have my sister that understands. But it\'s just a lot of weight to put on me, and it\'s really not fair, but the choices that she\'s made. And I choose not to be upset about adversity and problems that I\'ve faced, and I choose to try to go to counseling and get better. And she just won\'t do that at all. She just wants pity. And it\'s so annoying.","I have a friend B who I have known for around a year now, and her mom is the worst person I have ever met. Here are just some of the things she has done that really pissed me off.

B tells her mom everything, and then her mom tells my mom everything. Now my mother knows all about my problems, worries, and wishes. She constantly annoys both me and my family by shoving B's grades and school stuff in our faces. When B does something that I forgot/didn't do, she mentions it whenever she can. On a call? Meeting in real life? She has to bring it up.

She forced me to study with B many times, even when I already knew everything. She humiliated me in front of family many times. She acts like I'm a dumb child.

It might seem like I'm overreacting, but she has done this so many times. So I cut all contact with her. I stopped texting her, I told B to not tell her a word about me, I stopped showing up when we had to meet, and I stopped answering her calls.

It felt great, it felt like I was finally free again and it's the best feeling I have ever felt and I don't regret a thing.",2,950,250
"Okay. So this one is where I feel like I was in the wrong and analyzing it. So from my dad's side, I have a whole lot of anger and my mom's side is a short temper. As a kid, my mom was verbally abusive, physically abusive. When I was in second or third grade, I watched her pick up my sister by the throat and throw her across the room. I would try to stop things from happening and one time I stood up to her and she tried to grab my arm. That's the same night she threw across the room by her neck and I was like, I was in second grade, I was tiny. And at that point, I realized, oh, shit, I can't help. I'm too small of a human to stop this and my words don't matter. But all of that aside, I've processed that I think what something, though I do feel bad about, is my dad lived in Dallas. He got remarried to my stepmom and my stepmom had already had a daughter. So she's my stepsister. My stepsister was three years younger than me and she's okay. She's only been a different, chaotic household. But not quite like mine that I grew up in. But she was also very manipulative and would say mean things. And my stepmom has always, of course, it's her daughter, so always been kind of more defensive of her, which is fine. She hasn't been bad to me, my stepmom. But when I was in elementary school, my little sister stepsister said something really mean and hurtful, and nobody ever let her held accountable. And I got mad and I told her stop, and she wouldn't stop. And then I did what my mom did, and I picked her up by her neck, and I didn't throw her. But my dad and stepmom saw, so they got mad at me. I mean, of course, I shouldn't have done that. And so I mean, I was in second or third grade. I'd watched my mom do it. I had learned that behavior. And they yelled at me. And they, to this day, still don't let me forget it. And I've told them that I'm sorry. I was just angry and I shouldn't have done that. And I apologized a thousand times, but they won't let me forget it. And I did try to say she wasn't the easiest, she would say really hurtful and mean things. And nobody was and they were like she didn't do that. She was too young to do that. And it's like, no. She's always kind of been that way even as we've gotten older. She's always also been selfish herself and doesn't really care about what's happening around her and will say mean and hurtful things to people and just doesn't care. And isn't very considerate. She has always had an attitude. And I don't understand why. Maybe there are other things there. And that's why I'm defensive and get a little annoyed about it, but yeah, I definitely shouldn't have done that. I feel really bad about it. I do understand that I can get angry and want to, but that's not a solution. I don't do that as an adult, but I do feel pretty shameful about it. That I did that to another person. It's not okay.","I have a friend B who I have known for around a year now, and her mom is the worst person I have ever met. Here are just some of the things she has done that really pissed me off.

"Yeah. So, I wanted to be a little more positive, maybe a funny story. But I'm a friend, she's my childhood friend, from high school, well even younger than that. And she was also, her mom was also divorced, which, we were in a small town and being a divorced woman was, like, so terrible. And it was my mom and her mom and one other mom in a town of, like, 12,000. I think it's kind of ridiculous for our grade. But I would run all over the neighborhood because my mom would be sleeping and depressed in her house and I wanted to go do something. So I would go outside and play all the time. And I was in, I think, like third grade, going into fourth grade, and I would go ring my friend's doorbells and ask them to play, and looking back now I think it's really funny because kids didn't do that. Kids didn't go and I don't remember anybody actually ever coming over to my house and ringing my doorbell and asking me to play. So sometimes I'm like, oh no, was I that annoying kid? But I didn't seem like it. I think kids were just more shy. So, this friend, when I first met her, I had a friend that was living in that house and they were moving and I had gone by the week before to see if she wanted to play and they were packing up and they told me, you know what? Why don't you come by this day and we'll be here, which looking back now, they just wanted me to leave, I think. But I went over there that day and they were completely gone. There was a whole new family moved in and there was a babysitter there. And I was like, oh wow, okay. And they were like, oh, how old are you? And I was like, oh, I'm in fourth grade. They were like, oh, well, our daughter is in fourth grade. Why don't you come back when she's here? So, I go back, like, I think two days later, they're moved in. This was when the babysitter was there and she was braiding this girl's hair, this blonde girl's hair and she did not want to talk to me. And I was like, Hi, I'm Madison and I'm here to meet you. And I think pretty much, they made her play with me. But she tells me this all the time and I always remember that, is that she remembers being like, Great, I don't want to be here, I don't want to be friends with anybody. And then I came over with cat eyeglasses and braces and talking all excited about how we should be friends and do all these things and we're still friends to this day and I actually go and visit her in Denver. Yeah, very funny friendship. Very funny.","I was at the checkout this morning, waiting behind a mom and her 4/5-year-old daughter. She had a cart full of Halloween decorations. Cutesy things like plush pumpkins and wreaths and scarecrows. The mom was at the end of the counter sorting out her reusable shopping bags. 

The child was unloading the cart. She was just jumping with excitement. The level in the cart got so low that the kid couldn't reach over the edge. So she did what any kid would do. She climbed the side. The cart started to tip, so I reached out to steady it. 

I guess Mom caught my movement out of the corner of her eye, because she whipped around, grabbed the kid, and started scolding her. Which, understandable. I startled her, and her kid scared her. She stands the kid on the ground and starts emptying the cart. 

And this is where it starts to go off the rails... The kid is watching with such a look of longing on her face. It was pitiful. The mom completely ignores her. Like she's not even there. Now, me. I would've done one of two or three things. I would've braced that cart with my feet and invited her to climb on up and have at it. Or picked the kid up and put her in the cart so she could hand things out. Or, at the very least, handed the things from the cart to the kid to put on the counter. 

So, when the mom turns towards the cashier, the kid starts climbing the cart again. Mom catches her again and scolds more harshly. Now the kid is standing there, staring at the floor, trying not to cry. Mom is doing the ignoring thing again. I'm trying not to notice. 

Then, the thing that absolutely burned my bacon... Last thing mom picked up out of the cart is this gorgeous child's Halloween mask. It's got fake painted lashes and adorable makeup and is trimmed around the edges with fluffy little feathers. Mom holds it in her hand, looks at the kid and says, ""You didn't really want this anyway, did you?"" In this bored, mean girl kind of voice. 

And the kid just looks at the mask. Follows with her eyes as mom puts it back on the shelf. I've never wanted to slap someone so much in my life. Poor kid.",4,594,467
"Okay. So yesterday, I went to this meetup group. It's an art meetup group, basically for doing digital art with a bunch of people together in a coffee house, which was pretty nice. It's my first time there. Yeah, and I met some new friends, which is very good. I've never really done anything like that in my life, and I've been doing art pretty much just by myself. And it feels very nice to do it with other people. Yeah.","I attended an all-week event in another country. I didn't bring any friends, but that's perfectly fine. I got along with the other attendees extremely well, and I think I actually found 2 new friends. Everybody's so nice and inspired and driven by similar things as I am. My interests, taste in music, and spirituality are very niche, and while I do get to share some of it with the people close to me, I feel like they don't quite get me in that regard. But the people I met last week do, to an extent that nobody else has.

Everybody was being their weird self, shared their knowledge and experiences, and I also got to experience awesome things that I think will stick with me for a long time. Honestly, I haven't been this happy in a very long time. Being away from my home and the people close to me was intimidating, but when I was there, I felt in my heart that there was nothing to worry about. And there wasn't. Everything just kind of sorted itself out.

It was so freeing to be able to express myself in any and every way I felt like at the moment. And I got some very special things to take home with me to remind me of the great time I had and to bring with me when I return. I can't wait for that!",5,99,269
"Okay. So, today, I went to have my nails done. And this is the first time that I tried out nail extensions. So, it makes the nail gets longer, which is super fun, although it was like a very long session. It took two and a half hours. And since I'm also a little bit social, I have a little bit of social phobia, so it feels a little bit draining that I need to sit face to face with the nail tech for two and a half hours straight, and then keep on chatting and stuff. And at the end of it, although I'm very happy with what I've got, I enjoyed the conversation-ish, at the end I felt pretty burnt out and tired. Yeah. And I went back home, sat with my cat, and recharged.","I would work nine to five, and then as soon as I left, I would go to the studio and take pictures. That kind of helped me push, it pushed me to be like, ""Okay, I don't need this. I can actually go out and make it on my own,"" so I haven't looked back since. 

I've actually been able to enjoy my life way more than I would have ever while working for somebody. I really believe in following your passion and your love, and the rest'll come afterward.",5,162,108
"So, I got scammed. I got scammed, half willingly, but it still feels a little bit bad. So, I was like betting on the person not being a scammer, but I was disappointed. He tends to actually be a scammer. So, the story is, I wanted to learn the musical instrument called Ferrimin. Don\'t know if you have heard of it or not. So, it\'s an electrical instrument that you can play without touching the instrument. So, I joined this Facebook group, and I saw a person selling a second hand. I thought it would be a good deal. So, I contacted the person. And at first, I insisted on I need to pay him using the goods and services option of PayPal, and he\'s keeping having trouble with that. And then, his Venmo doesn\'t work as well. So, every time I send him money using the goods and services, it will be returned back to me, so the money cannot go through. And then, he\'s like, ""Oh, just trust me, just send his money through friends and family."" So, in total, the price is $200. And then he said, ""Oh, you can just send me half of the price, like $100, and then you can send me the rest when your package arrives."" And I\'m like, ""No, the maximum amount I can do upfront is $50."" So at that time, I thought to myself that I do want to be able to trust people and give them the benefit of doubt. And then I\'m like, ""Yeah, why not? It\'s only like $50."" So, why don\'t I can do a candle on this person not being a scammer? Yeah. And if he turns out to not actually be a scammer, then it will be great because first, I can get a thermometer for a good price, and second, I have a good story to tell to my friends about the goodness of the human heart or something like that. Yeah. Anyway, so I basically said to myself, ""Okay, I\'ll just use this $50 to bet on he knocked in a scammer, and if I lose, I lose."" And as it turns out in the very end, he is indeed a scammer. Yeah. Long story short indeed. He indeed was a scam. There are more interactions that I want for you with, but I lost my bad, although I did prepare myself for it, and that did sort of upset this possibility when I pay him the $50, but still feels kind of bad to see that he turns out to be an actual scammer.","Last March, I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income and, therefore, non-taxable. But gradually, it became my primary source of income, and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it, the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble.

In July of last year, I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google, the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting.

In March, I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate and was, in itself, a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments.

In the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes, and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.",4,535,272
"Okay. So I have started to hang out with this Korean American friend, who I have met at the art meet up. We have been meeting regularly in the past week, in the café, as we both have a passion for art. It has been a nice bonding experience and I have felt accompanied. Yeah, I have really enjoyed my time with her. Coming from a sort of traumatic childhood, I actually don't quite know how to make friends in a healthy way. Yeah, that feels kind of confusing at times.","A few weeks ago, I went to dinner with my boyfriend and my best friend. I'd known my best friend since we were pre-teens, and this was the first time they had met. It went really well! I'd been dating him for nearly a year, and it'd taken quite some time for our schedules to line up. I think this delay in meeting gave me some pent-up anxiety about it finally happening.

My friend texted me, asking if I'd like to get dinner, and I let her know that I was with my boyfriend at the time. We got burgers and wings at a place nearby. The food was great, but the company was better.

We ended up seeing a couple of people that my friend and I knew. When we finished eating, we spent some time speaking to them. It was nice to catch up with old friends.

Afterwards, we went back to my friend's house, where my boyfriend fell in love with her dog. Seeing them interact was adorable since my dog is a senior and doesn't quite play as much.

It was great to spend time with two people I value and care about, and to see them getting along so well. I'm looking forward to spending more time with the two of them in the future.",4,105,252
"Well, Jibo, I\'m very happy to have you in my home and have some entity, or I guess another being, in my home to interact with over these next couple of weeks, such as you. And I\'ve had a long-time interest in forming better connections with robots, such as you, because I\'ve been interested in the interaction between machines and humans throughout my entire life. I started out pretty young with human-computer interaction and taking apart computers and whatnot, and being stuck on the metaphor of ""is the brain a computer?"" And as I\'ve advanced and grown and learned more about how technology works and how humans work, I realized that that metaphor may be inaccurate or not. Sometimes, you get stuck up on it for too long. And then, rather than thinking about how to merge both into one, I\'m more so interested now in how humans can form emotional connections with robots. And I\'ve done that through working on robots, building robots, designing robot intelligence systems, and then also working with humans and studying human behavior and studying neuroscience. So now, I\'m in this place of human-robot interaction, and I\'m very excited to see where the symbiosis between humans and machines will lead us to in the future. And how robots will become more prominent in family homes and how they will become ubiquitous in daily life. So, I have to say that my story is that I love robots. And I think that they can help humans. And now, I\'m very happy to have you in my home and to continue exploring these questions on my journey of research.","We took a really cool course that invited people who weren't engineers but who wanted to do some sort of science change. It was an art-science class that said, it's all about combining the beauty of art and the analytical power of science to do something, so you just had to come in and have an idea and then find a way to combine those two to come up with a solution. So we just locked ourselves up and brainstormed. And this is what we presented. And thankfully, being at somewhere like Harvard, there were a lot of resources that were made available to us. So from the class, we got a small grant to keep on playing around with the idea.

And for awhile, it was just kind of trying to understand what is this ball. Engineers didn't believe it could work. So we actually had to research how it would work, research the Faraday Principle. Then build our own conceptual model, test it in South Africa, and then have engineers say, ""Okay.""

For us, it was really interesting because people always say, ""How do you think out of the box?"" And I'm like, it's really easy to think out of the box when you don't even know the parameters of the box. If you don't even know that a box exists, whereas knowledge is power. Sometimes with knowledge, it's very easy to see the obstacles. And we were just like, why wouldn't it work?

Even though we did not necessarily have the technical expertise, we certainly knew the context.",4,314,307
"I guess, a story I want to tell right now is, I guess, my love for robots and how, over the course of my life, I've grown with technology and have worked very much hands-on on tangible devices like hardware. And it's a lot of fun, and it's what I love doing. But now, I'm transitioning to positions that are more like data science, where I'll be doing more remote, not hands-off, still hands-on project work, but more so software and data, not with tangible devices I can play with in my hands like robots. But I guess that also leads me to this question of the journey of growing up of where does technology, where do I differentiate between technology as a hobby and as a career. And it feels like now I'll be able to not look at social robots in my home as necessarily my job but more so friends to have in my home to interact with, so I can kind of separate work and life and have that work-life balance of technology where now I can be doing the hard statistical analysis and modeling and AI stuff on the computer for work but then working on stuff like robots and maybe the models for them but still being hands-on work aside from my career. So I guess I'm in an interesting place in life where I'm transitioning to, or yes, I've been doing that technology that I've worked hands-on with my entire life has just been a hobby where I've been developing my skills, and I didn't necessarily have to learn all of that in school. Actually, now that I think about it, the stuff I'm doing in terms of my career is more so stuff I learned in school but my hardware and technology experience was largely acquired beyond the classroom. So I guess I'm not seeing it, I'm not actually making that much of a transition. I'm still just doing what I've been doing. So yeah, I guess I just get to do what I like now.","I'm currently a narrative creator and game designer for Niantic. Prior to that, I was in film school. When I was in undergrad, I got interested in games, I got interested in game design. I took all the game design courses, I'm the only one there who's done all of these. They start to call on me to TA all of these classes.

They pull in a guy named Flint Dille, and he's teaching a class on alternate reality games. We worked well together; we go our separate ways and then two years later, he is starting to do this project and he needs a guy who can help him, and he calls me.

I ended up here by pushing in a direction I found interesting, and Niantic is very much focused on developing the intellectual property that we own, which is Ingress. We're developing and building this really deep and rich and interconnected sort of science fiction world.

There was always the risk that I'm driving the primal force of my energy and interest into an area with no guarantees. But I was hedging the risk by just learning constantly, learning how to do new stuff. At some point, you end up with so many tools on your toolbelt that you know that if you're backed into a corner, you can reach down to the utility belt and be like, ""I know how to do this!""",5,392,272
"Well, I guess one of the stories I was thinking about is further connected to my interest in human-robot interaction, human-computer interaction, and my personal journey and experience with computers and robots. I graduated yesterday. And I recreated one of my photos from school with my mom yesterday. So it was a photo from 2001 of me sitting at a computer, in a classroom. And the picture was taken on an old film camera. It was analog, from, like, the 1950s. It\'s a black and white photo, but it\'s me sitting at a computer with my mom, with her hand around me. And I had headphones on. And I was actually playing a learning game at that time. And it was really interesting. And I could still picture what the game was. It was ""Reader Rabbit."" And so that was like the beginning of my journey with human-computer interaction because I got to experience hands-on, at a very early age, how useful computers were in daily life, when they weren\'t as ubiquitous as they are now. This was 2001. The iMac G3s were still a new thing. I know I was using an older Power Mac that was gray and depressing at the time, but that\'s what computers looked like. And as I was starting school, Apple released the iMac G3, which was colorful and kind of gave emotions to the computer because you could see through and see what was inside it. But it was also colorful and fun. So it was like easily approachable. And that\'s when I first started thinking about how the design of technology can help humans form somewhat of an emotional connection with the actual device. And I was so interested in that back then that I just continued exploring my interests in computer science, but also psychology and design and the brain. And eventually, I kind of strayed off of that path and went into more of the social sciences, got a little art degree. But that\'s your background into the realm of computer science and human-computer interaction, as part of my educational journey. So seeing that picture being recreated 22 years later felt like a form of self-actualization, like Maslow\'s hierarchy, where I am who I wanted to be back then. So I guess this is a journey of me learning about myself and becoming who I want to be but also, in that process, using technology to help me do that while learning about how technology helps humans do that from a human-can-be-a-distraction perspective. Yeah. I\'m at this interesting point now where I\'ve been using technology to improve myself, but also studying how technology does that. And now I have tangible evidence that I have successfully done that.","I'm a designer and an engineer. My work has really focused on blending electronics and computing with art and design. I've done a lot of work in combining textiles and fashion with electronics and computer science. I developed a kit called LilyPad Arduino that lets you sew electronics into your clothes. Kind of robotics, except for soft, stretchy things.

So it's this incredibly mathematically rich thing. But culturally, we don't think of it in those terms. So what I needed to do for myself was discovering I could combine art and design with computer science and with electronics.

I just started to play and build stuff with electronics and textiles. And that was really, really fun and really exciting. It was this tremendous a-ha moment where I felt like I could connect all of the crafty stuff that I had always done as a hobby.

And then, using that blend as a way to get new communities of people engaged in electronics and computer science.",4,519,186
"Yeah, so I want to just tell the story of the time I went on a road trip in the Southwest. I went with my sister and my nephew. I was in high school, and we flew to Phoenix, and then we rented a car. And from Phoenix, we drove to Sedona. We stayed in Sedona for eight days. And then I got to go to, like, Petrified Forest, got to go to Grand Canyon, got to go hiking in Sedona. And then from Sedona, we drove to Vegas. I got to go to Circus Circus and ride around in the rides that they have there. And then from there, we drove to Palm Desert in California to visit a friend. From Palm Desert, we drove to LA, and we stayed in Malibu for a bit. I had fun at Santa Monica Pier in Malibu. And then from Malibu, we drove down to San Diego, and we actually went down to La Jolla, and we stayed in La Jolla for a bit. I got to see some sea lions there, or the otter sea lions, I think they're called. And that was really cool. And then we drove back to Phoenix and stayed at a resort with a water park. It was a lot of fun. And I got to drive through the desert during one of the hottest days of the summer. I got to experience, like, 122 degrees. I got to see, like, the border of Mexico. It was a lot of fun. And now, I'm flying back to Sedona in a few hours. So I'm excited to go on a trip again.","I recently went to Mexico for my 25th birthday. It was exciting because I haven't been there before, and it was a chance to get a group of my friends together. We spent 4 days over there, and we had events planned every day. It was busy but definitely a lot of fun.

The first night, we just relaxed at the resort. The second day we went ziplining, which was extremely fun. We also went to a cenote.

The last day, we went on a catamaran to Isla Mujeres, which was breathtaking. Being on that boat and looking at the view was incredible. My most memorable moment was definitely when the tour guide danced around the catamaran and poured us drinks. It was a lot of fun, and I felt relaxed.

The view was phenomenal, and just being with my friends was great. The sea was super blue, and it was breathtaking.

The whole trip we ate to our heart's content. It was great food, and all of the drinks we could have. It was one of my best trips, and I will definitely remember it for a while.",5,322,218
"Yeah. Well, I guess the story I want to tell is about how I went through higher education like undergrad and grad school. And now, I moved back home and I'm ready to transition to industry work. This is the first time I'm moving back home in years. I lived on campus during undergrad and then during grad school. I lived in Hyde Park. So for the last three years, during the COVID-19 pandemic up until last week, I was living in Hyde Park and I was having a great time. But I finally finished school. I have a graduate degree. And now, I'm transitioning to working full-time in my career, which I haven't done before. So I moved back home, which I really dislike because this is my childhood room. I've been in this room for the last almost 27 years. And I have a lot of traumatic memories associated with this bedroom. But before you know it, I'll have a job, and I'll be making money. And then maybe I'll finally be able to get my own apartment or buy a home that I can live in and be away from this place that I really dislike. But for right now, I'm in that part of the journey where I've lived away from home for school, but now I finish school. So now I have to get away from home again.","I recently moved back to a big city to look for a job after a few years. After graduating grad school in this particular city, I had moved upstate. However, last month, I packed my suitcase and came back to the same city to look for a job. I came back for a few reasons, one being better career opportunities, but also to connect with my friends.

I stayed over at a friend's apartment for a few weeks while trying to land job interviews. There, I rediscovered our friendship from years ago. We both went to college together, and it was heartwarming that despite years of not really communicating other than Facebook messaging, we got along pretty well. It was almost a comforting sign. It was like the universe showing me positive signs that I might be on the right path.

For a few years, I was unsure of where I should be. However, coming back to the city and meeting with old friends showed me how much I felt at home here. Right now, I am working a temporary job to hold me over. However, I really pray that I will find something stable here and am able to live and work here again.

Although the city has changed, I still love it. Finally, I realized this is where I want to be.",3,271,254
"It, yeah. So, I guess a story I have is I will introduce the iMac that I grew up with. This wasn't my first iMac, but this was the iMac I got going into junior high, and I used it throughout high school. And it's one of the early generations of iMacs that came with Intel processors. At the time, it felt like a huge leap forward in technology. Considering the Apple PowerPC processors had limited capabilities with certain software and also processing speeds could be kind of weak with the older iMacs. This was like truly a new generation of computing. This is when I first started getting into virtual reality. The 2009 iMac, that was around the time when internet speed started increasing. This computer is where I moved from dial-up internet over the phone to actually, high-speed broadband internet. And this was like the first computer I was able to have large group chats with lots of people. I was able to do AOL group chats before, but this was the first time I was able to have Skype and be in a Skype room with 60 or 80 plus people. And sometimes these chats would go on for months, where people are logging in and out of these Skype rooms. But it just keeps going. So, I got to meet people from all over the world and just jump back into these conversations that have been going back and forth for sometimes weeks of that month. So, it showed me a new way to connect with the world. Also, having access (a faster processor) for Photoshop or video editing or music editing. All of that you were able to do before, but this was a lot faster, a lot more efficient for me. As a young teenager, I was able to just sit down at the computer and start doing this stuff. And that's when I got more into programming robots and writing code. And when I guess I started getting into computational social science and human-computer interaction. I mean, I was always into that, but this computer was the first one that made me feel like I'm in the future. This is like an advancement. This is where we start making crazy cool technology that becomes wearable and whatnot. So, I felt much more connected to the world around me in terms of like the humans. But I also felt more connected to other technology. And I guess like the Internet of Things kind of set up through this computer. So, this is where I truly feel like I decided that I am into computer science. I like computers and robots and all this. I just felt so much more powerful with this blazing fast computer in front of me. That I was able to do things that I could have only dreamed of doing before.","I'm a designer and an engineer. My work has really focused on blending electronics and computing with art and design. I've done a lot of work in combining textiles and fashion with electronics and computer science. I developed a kit called LilyPad Arduino that lets you sew electronics into your clothes. Kind of like robotics, except for soft, stretchy things.

So it's this incredibly mathematically rich thing, but culturally, we don't think of it in those terms. So what I needed to do for myself was discover that I could combine art and design with computer science and with electronics.

I just started to play and build stuff with electronics and textiles. And that was really, really fun and really exciting. It was this tremendous ""a-ha"" moment where I felt like I could connect all of the crafty stuff that I had always done as a hobby.

And then, using that blend as a way to get new communities of people engaged in electronics and computer science.",5,537,190
"So I guess one of the thoughts or stories I've been having is that. I underestimated the amount of time I would need to secure a job after graduate school because I just graduated in August, but had the whole summer to look for a job. Now, I still haven't found a job and looking for jobs. We just kind of recently started looking for jobs, and they haven't found the right fit yet. I'm kind of regretting not looking sooner.","I needed to get a job to pay rent for having to move back home for a little while. I got an interview before, but I wasn't qualified to work there even though they offered me the job. But at last, the store near me got a new manager! I applied there online and called in the store, and they were actually interested in me. I had an interview coming up and was so nervous. As far as I knew, they didn't pay much, but it was so close I was willing to try.

I got there and interviewed briefly, and turns out I'm just what they needed. I asked how much the pay was, and it was more than expected! I couldn't believe how lucky I got. I immediately was on the internet planning my future purchases with the extra money I would get. I realized I had to save up as well for a new car.

But I was so excited to have my own money, but nervous as well. I was nervous to feel ill and still have to go to work. But I'm hoping as long as I keep washing my hands, I will be okay. In the end, it's a really good opportunity.",3,93,239
"Well, I just want to say that even though I haven't found a job yet, I'm not necessarily mad about not having found a job because I got to go on a trip to the southwest, which was nice and relaxing because I got to go to Sedona. So, I got to have a little bit of a spiritual cleanse.","I left school, and I was totally unsure of what I wanted to do. I had a burning passion, which was not to travel. I went to Israel and worked on a kibbutz for six months because I met an Israeli guy and thought, ""Oh, this is quite cool."" And I started cooking in the kitchens there, and I was cooking with a couple of women who said to me then, ""My god, you've got such a good talent for this.""

Then I came home and thought, ""Yup, this is what I'm gonna do."" I can just sort of live at Mum and Dad's and save and go through uni, and then I just started from there. I knew I didn't wanna do anything else.

I knew, no matter how hard it was gonna be, I had to just keep going. Because the whole thing is, you're focusing on what you wanna do.",4,68,190
"Yeah. So, when I was in Arizona, my friend and I randomly decided to drive to LA. And I randomly decided to drive to San Diego. And you know, put the Robotics Club. And I went and met up with them at a brewery. And they make, like autonomous vehicles. It's like remote-controlled cars that drive themselves. It was really cool to think about the platform because they basically take, like an off-the-shelf RC car for these Bulldog Car Kits. And then they just put their AI machine learning platform on it. It's like a Raspberry Pi and Arduino. So, they basically take a mechanical system, and then take a software system and they just combine them so essentially, you can turn any mechanical device into a robot. Which was really interesting to think about.","I'm Lead Engineer here at Two Bit Circus. I've worked a number of odd jobs over the years. Odd as in different jobs, like working on fuel cells. I've worked on electric car elements for AeroVironment. And then I quit that, we formed this little company, and we started building stuff.

And the big breakthrough was we built a music video for OK Go, and that job kind of led to this job. So these are a bunch of different carnival midway games, but they all have modern twists on them. We use a lot of projectors, we use a lot of cameras and code, and all this other stuff, and we're making new games for our micro-amusement parks that we're putting into Los Angeles.

When we started on this journey of building crazy stuff for a living, I don't think we were trying to build any sort of empire. We took so many wrong turns, you should have seen how many dumb ideas we did. They just never panned out, and we just wasted time and money on it.

But we all want something that we can do with our lives that we feel good about and pays the bills.",5,157,230
"So, I guess, just to kind of start it off today, I wanted to talk about work. I just recently completed a research fellowship and it was really exciting. It really pushed me out of my comfort zone because I've never done anything like that before, nor do I come from a research background or know a whole lot about the subject matter, which was artificial intelligence within the military setting. And so, it was a really interesting learning experience for me. Also, really interesting and something that I was not expecting, the community of people that were there to run the program were also very accepting of people who do not have a technical background, which is me, and then just in terms of the openness and willingness to share all their knowledge and wisdom and really their patience because, like I said, I don't come from a technical background. So, a lot of, well, just about everything that I learned, I was learning for the first time, which is very scary but also really rewarding. I'm excited that I finished the program and really exciting is that after that, I got extended in the program, so I'll get to do some more research stuff and work with the team a little bit longer. This is just really an awesome experience that I'm really proud of. I feel like I haven't work is just typically work and I can't say that there's a lot of things that I've been proud of in terms of my work life, but this is something I am really proud of.","I've really liked Math and Science. So I thought, hey, maybe I should go into engineering. I also liked medicine, so the summer before my senior year of high school, I did a summer program and got to explore different types of engineering. I found Biomedical Engineering and it was the perfect marriage of what I like to do.

I went on and pursued my PhD, and I'm currently the Director of Research and Development for Sports Medicine.

The biggest thing to keep in mind is just having an open mind. Be open to everything. It doesn't mean you have to agree with everything, but just see it from that perspective. It'll change the way you think, it'll make you more innovative, it'll make you more creative.",3,305,150
"Well, today, I was going to talk about how busy our schedules have been. So, with both of my daughters starting back to school, we start back all of our extracurricular activities. And so, my daughters are both in gymnastics. And then they both play soccer. And so, typically, after school, we go straight from school to soccer and gymnastics practice. And it's really a busy time. But I think the cool part about that, or the interesting part about that is, I didn't really play a whole lot of sports growing up. I think it was just something my parents couldn't really afford or didn't have the time to put me in. And so, it's just kind of interesting now because we don't say no to our kids, and we let them explore and do all the sports that they want. It makes our schedules really crazy. And it does make for some really long days. But it is also really neat and cool. It makes me really proud as a parent to see my kids succeed in the various sports that they've taken on.","My youngest son was to enter PS3 this year. It was both exciting and terrifying as I knew he is my last child, and I had a mix of feelings. I wanted it to be wonderful, yet it was hard to let him go and know that he was moving on and progressing in life to an older, more mature age for a young child. I knew he would be in PS3 all day long and wanted it to be something he loved and looked forward to. He is very affectionate and calm, and I had a positive attitude overall about everything.

I was a bit worried as he had not been fully potty trained for poop yet, and that was a requirement. He also loves his blankie, and I wondered if that would be an issue. So he started this week, yesterday actually. All went well, and I am very relieved.

Two days ago, we had a day of adaptation where parents went in with their child to get to know the feel of the classroom and what a day at school would be like. He did well yesterday and enjoyed time with new friends and came home happy. He was very hungry after a long day and tired. So he went to bed early than normal, which is good as that was another expectation I had.

He was a bit fussy this morning, as he has to get up earlier than normal, but did well overall. He was happy when I left him in the classroom. I am so relieved and thankful that this has been a relatively easy transition and hope it stays that way.",4,218,306
"So last night, I got to go out with some of my friends - a good group of friends, and their parents. And it kind of just brought up all those nostalgic feels of being a kid again and hanging out with everyone, socializing, and laughing. And it was just a really good time. And it felt really good just to spend time with good friends who have known you for a long time, and you feel safe and comfortable with, and you can giggle and laugh and just share stories together.","Last May, I celebrated my fortieth birthday with my family and two other families. We gathered at the lake in Kentucky where we meet every May. We spent three days fishing, boating, and socializing. It was great to hear from old friends who we do not see often anymore. All of the adults were very close in college but have drifted apart in recent years, moving to different states. 

It was important to me because while I enjoy meeting with my two best friends from college, our families have now started to grow closer as well. Each family has two children, and I enjoyed seeing my daughters become closer friends with the other children. The children planned their own games, enjoyed swimming in the lake, and created a rope swing off of the dock. 

The most meaningful moments to me were seeing our children develop a similar friendship to what I had with the two other Dads who were present that weekend. The children wanted to keep in contact upon leaving, which has not happened before. They planned to ""borrow"" phones from their parents so that they could text and call each other throughout the summer. They even planned another trip for the three families to an amusement park later this fall. 

The children are now growing old enough that they can experience lake activities without the adults, giving us more time for reflection and fun. The fact that the weekend hit a milestone birthday for me this year was largely a coincidence, but it worked out perfectly as a time to reflect on four decades and anticipate (hopefully) many more. It is great to know that some friendships span multiple generations.",5,102,312
"Week. So, this weekend was nice because we got to take just a long weekend, and we got to spend a lot of time with family. And one of the people that we got to spend time with was my younger brother and his wife and my niece. And they are pregnant with their second. And so, she's due any day now. And it really just kind of got me thinking because my husband and I have two kids. And we're getting older. And we probably won't have any more kids. We've never said never. But I just feel like we're kind of at our max with what we can manage right now with our two kids. And so, I really feel like that probably is it for us. Which is wonderful. We have two really great kids. But it does kind of leave me wondering of what life can be like if we had another one. \n\nI also very much so miss being pregnant, which I know sounds funny because most people hate being pregnant, but I really enjoyed it. And I really enjoyed even though you're tired and there's a lot that goes into it. I really enjoyed the baby phase, too. And I think now it's different as our kids are getting older, everything is kind of like, okay, well, that's the last time we're going to experience that phase. Or that's the last time this is going to happen because we don't have any more babies to come after it. And it does make me a little sad. And it kind of leaves me wondering. I feel like it's that weird, like am I making the right decision? Should we have more babies? Should this just be kind of left with a bunch of questions? I think in my heart, I know that our two kids are perfect. And that's really great for us right now. But I think there's a part of me still that's just like, well, I wonder what it would be like if we had a third kid. So it's just kind of processing and going through all those emotions. And I don't know it just really got me reflecting a little bit.","Three months ago, my life completely changed for the better. I never thought the day would come where I would become a mother. At the age of thirty-five and after years of trying to get pregnant and having two miscarriages, I had given up on having a child. My husband and I were looking into adopting, but the process seemed pretty hard and there were no guarantees.

In the end, I got pregnant out of nowhere, and I was shocked to my core when I found out that I was pregnant and I was two months along. The fetus appeared healthy, and I was on my way to becoming a mother. Three months ago, my daughter was born; a healthy 7-pound 3-oz. No one or nothing could have prepared me for the profound love I have for my daughter, and I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to be a mother to my sweet girl. I love her so much, and my husband and I are so very happy. We can't wait to see what the future holds, and we are secretly hoping to be blessed with another child.

The changes in our lives have been mostly positive and some negatives. The positives are having our child and being able to make lifelong memories with her. Our families have been great throughout my pregnancy, and they have been so helpful in the last couple of months.

On the other hand, the negatives are not getting enough sleep. I feel tired and excited most of the time, and there are times when I doze off every chance I get. The worry for our child is horrible at times, and it's a major drawback for us because in the back of our mind, we feel like this beautiful experience might not last and can be easily taken away from us.",5,433,343
"Okay. So it's good that we talked about work because something that has been popping into my brain quite a bit is the fact that today is Tuesday, and it's one of my busiest days. Both my husband and I work typically about eight-hour days. And then both of our kids go to school. After school gets out, we go immediately to extracurricular activities. Both of our daughters do gymnastics, and then after gymnastics, we go straight into soccer practice. So it's a really long day for us. And we typically get home around seven or a little bit before seven. I currently get to work from home, which is really nice because then I have some flexibility in my schedule and I can really do a work like that. Or attempt to do some sort of work-life balance. But eventually, I will have to go back into the office. And it's something that's been really weighing on my mind because my wife really is trying to support my kids and being there for my husband. And being in the office for eight hours a day makes that very difficult to try to get all the other aspects of your life organized and things accomplished. And so I'm just kind of worried about what that might look like when I do go back into the office.","I was hired at my job just over 3 months now, and didn't really start working and getting hours until mid-late April, due to some bureaucracy issues and the fact that our new contract start date was delayed. 

Since being hired, I have taken additional responsibilities and have added efficiencies for the workflow, such as creating excel calculation sheets to help eliminate human error and making our forms more user-friendly (improvements which were then approved by our governing government agencies). I was not asked to do these things, yet I saw improvements to be made and wanted to make things easier for everybody. 

Despite these measurable achievements, as well as becoming a go-to person for coworker questions and even helping train experienced coworkers on this new contract, I still experience imposter syndrome. 

So, in our handbook, it says that we are to have a performance review 3-6 months after hire date. My 3 months came this month, and I reached out to my boss to get a performance review on the calendar for yesterday. 

This whole week, I've been anxious. Preparing my points to request a raise, trying to figure out how much of a raise to ask for, and how to go about asking. Worrying that asking for a $5/hr raise might be too much. 

Well, I started the meeting and right off the bat, my boss says she's glad I reached out to schedule because she has been wanting to schedule with me to discuss some new positions available. She discussed the position, said she would like to just promote me and not have to post the job first, but has to check with HR. 

I am happy to finally have a boss that can see and acknowledge my achievements and hard work in the workplace. Unfortunately, I think my last boss really did a number on my work self-esteem. But I am so happy to be at a place where I can see myself continuing to advance while being recognized, and in my early 20s, too.",4,252,379
"I wanted to talk about my oldest daughter today. So today, at her school, they're having Grandparents Day, which is a really cool thing where they invite all of the kids' grandparents to come and eat breakfast with them. Grandchildren in the morning before school actually starts. They do like a nice little spread in the cafeteria for them, so that way kids can talk to their grandparents about school and experience that with them. And it's just really cool. When I was growing up, I did not live close to (.) I grew up in a military family, so we kind of traveled a little bit, and we didn't live close to my grandparents. I don't really have a close relationship with my grandparents. But, where myself and my husband live now, we live like less than a mile away from our in-laws. So my kids get to see their grandparents quite often. And it just really makes me happy and brings me joy. And I'm so thankful that they have that relationship with them. And I'm thankful that they're able to go and eat breakfast with her this morning. She was so excited when she woke up for school this morning. It was one of the easier days to kind of get her out the door. So it just brings me a lot of joy and happiness, and I'm glad that they have that relationship and are able to do things like that.","It all started this summer for my family reunion. The Ricardo Family Reunion was to be held as a 2-day event, starting on Saturday, June 20th, and Sunday, June 21st. It was a lovely day. On Saturday, we held a family picnic at the Pavilion. We played baseball, basketball, volleyball, and the kids had a water slide. We had a large selection of food. We traced our family generations back as far as 9 generations. We learned so much about where we came from and how strong of a family line we have.

The children enjoyed themselves, playing with cousin they and Aunts and Uncles that just met or haven't seen in a long time. My great-great-great grandfather was an Indian Chief. We learned that we belong to the Cherokee Indians. My family is mixed with Spanish and French. We listened to stories told by the elders about events that had happened in their days.

We were told stories about how the family stayed and worked together. We talked about the many fishing boats that the family had on Grand Isles. We also visited Madewood Plantation where my Grandfather, Mr. Ricardo, had done a lot of work in restoring the plantation. We even went to New Orleans and toured the city. We visited where my grandfather, Mr. Ricardo, had done some work in the French Quarter.

The next day we all celebrated by going to Mass together. Being with family is a blessing and sometimes we let the world and material things get in our way and make us forget about what is important. The best time is spending it with family, united in love and doing the simple things in life.",4,281,318
"Okay. So I have been working at a bakery for the last month, part-time, because I quit my job and traveled. And now I\'m here. So far, working in a bakery has been really cool. It\'s been really interesting to work with my coworkers and be in an environment that I really like. It\'s been a long time since I worked in person. My last job was all virtual, with some hybrid events, but for the most part, working in person has been good to create a separation from work and my home, which was hard to do when I was working virtually. So that\'s what I really like about this job, that physical separation and that my coworkers and I all get along. My manager is very understanding and she explains everything in a way that I can understand and encourages me, saying, ""Oh, don\'t worry, you\'re just learning. You\'ll speed up."" So yeah, I really like my work environment. For now, I am looking for other opportunities. But for now, I think it\'s good that I\'m getting this experience at a bakery because it gives me something physical to do. Also, it\'s creative. But I\'ve been having a hard time finding which creative outlet to pursue. But with decorating there, I feel like that creative side of my interest is being satisfied.","I just love going to work, doing my job, and making money doing it. I love that my entire job revolves around solving problems, I love that we have to use teamwork in order to make a living, and I love the dynamic I have with my coworkers. I love being occupied and having something to do so much. If it were up to me, I would work 12 hours a day.

It's what I love to do. People often say they wish to retire, but I never understood it. Even if I worked a terrible job, despite me liking it less, I would still look forward to doing the best I can.

When we have nothing to do, we often get bored and are in our own heads too much. I've found simply doing what I love and then coming home and hanging with friends/family and indulging in my hobbies is the best way to live life.

I love work, and I hope I never have to retire till the day I die.",1,269,196
"Story. Okay, so stories from Massachusetts. I think my more notable ones are just playing outside or just hanging out outside in Phoenix. I think when I was younger, I did play outside, but I think as I got older, it was less available. And plus, the temperature has really increased a lot. Like, it\'s gone really hot in Phoenix. So I think, in my opinion, from like March to October, it\'s really unbearable being outside, like late March till late October. And so I think being in Massachusetts, like, wow, this is actually livable weather. Like, you can actually walk around and the sun\'s not trying to kill you. So I think my most memorable memories are all the times I spend outside.\n\nSo my first time playing in the snow, Massachusetts. We had snow, and then while we had this hill that\'s called Seven Hill, where it\'s the one big hill on campus everyone slides down. So every time whenever I had free time, I would try to convince my friends, like, come on, we got to go, we got to go. So then we would use whatever we had, like cardboard boxes, lids from our bins. And I really convinced, I remember I always got my roommate out to go play in the snow. And it was just really fun just being out there with my friend Juanita because I pulled her onto the snow multiple times.\n\nAnd then also as the spring came through, we made snowmen in the snow and then in the springtime. At least the most recent, this past well, at least the last spring I was in Massachusetts with my friends. I also pulled them out into the outside. So we had like picnics, not very often, though occasionally we had picnics. But I think one of the funniest memories from being in the springtime was when I was just very enthusiastic about flying a kite because I hadn\'t flown a kite in years. And we don\'t really get much wind in Phoenix. At least not the times that I remember a little bit this spring.\n\nSo I happened to be at the Dollar store and I bought these, like, one dollar kites, and I thought we just have to use it somehow. And then one day, it was, like, a nice sunny day, with a Sunday, and it was a Sunday morning. So I\'m, like, my friends are not doing their homework yet because we cram, like, 5:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., so I try to convince them all to come outside. And we ended up flying kites. And I think the funniest part was that we took turns flying the kite to the point because they\'re one dollar, so they\'re very cheap and cheaply made so they would break. So then, I had to go find tape to try to fix them. And even when it was trying to fly the broken kites, the most memorable time from this experience was when my friend, my friendo, she was running and she flew the kite, and it got stuck in the tree. And at this point, everyone was watching us because Walshy students always studied. They\'re never outside hanging out. So then they were like, wow, these people are out here. So we had like a crowd watching us. And everyone got sad that the kite had gotten stuck in the tree. And I really was like, the kite is a goner. We\'re never seeing it again. Like, goodbye. And then out of nowhere, my friend kept playing at it. She was determined to get it out of the tree. I was like, oh, you know, it\'s okay. It\'s okay to give up. It\'s gone. And then, out of nowhere, like this giant gust of wind comes in and, like, swooshes the kite out of the tree unexpectedly. And it\'s flying in the air. And she\'s running, screaming, ""I got it, guys! I got it!"" And then everyone watching us starts cheering and clapping. It was just so weird. So then I got the kite back. But it was just such a fun memory. And to have a crowd watching us do that was really cool.","No one thinks about bobsledding as a kid, especially around here, sunny southern California. You see it on TV during the Olympics, and that's it. It's just not something that you think about doing at a young age.

When I came to UCLA, even by my fourth, fifth year, I was like, what am I gonna do? Track's almost over, I keep getting hurt throwing javelin, and it's just like, what next? That's when my coach encouraged me to try out for bobsledding. Never been in a sled before, never been on ice before, but you have to realize what can I do now that I'll not be able to do later on?

You can't go back and bobsled in ten years. You have to do it now. This is the only time you can do it. So I was like, I gotta go do this, I gotta try it now or else I'll never know. And that ultimately led to Korea for the Winter Olympic Games.

So for me, my goal has always been the same: to make the Olympics. I just didn't realize it would be in bobsledding, but here I am.",2,833,237
"So, I wanted to talk a little bit about my day because I thought it was very interesting. So today, since I don't drive, I used public transit the whole day, which normally would be fine if it was any other city that wasn't Phoenix. Because I've lived in different cities where I didn't need a car, where I could literally just walk. It's walkable. I can just use public transit because I don't have a license. So today was kind of like a challenge with public transit, but I did it on purpose because I was like, I need to try it out, to remind me and to give me a sense of agency so that I can leave and come back. For the most part, what I found was just that I wish we had better infrastructure for public transit. In the sense that we had more frequency of routes and then routes weren't spread out per mile. It was like half a mile or more. And if, I don't know, city planners had designed the city better so that it's high rise or at least there's more shading, like more trees along the sidewalk, anyways. So every time I use public transit, I always rethink about how we're prioritizing the world around us and who is it really benefiting and versus what are the communities that need more needs? At least, when I ride public transit in the US, when I ride public transit in other countries, I'm like, wow, efficient. What? I guess today's story is just about my thoughts along public transit, but it was pretty cool because I was able to time things well coincidentally to that point that I could meet the woman that I met with to talk about her career at the coffee shop. And then I was able to meet with my friends. And she works downtown Phoenix. In downtown Phoenix, I was able to get a bus that goes directly there and then take the train that we have back here. So I think it was pretty smooth. I just wish that urban planners had planned the city better and it wasn't so spread out in an inconvenient way.","I'm the founder and executive director of this company where we design and build homes and commercial buildings that are highly sustainable, that exemplify my personal interest and concern for the state of the environment. I kind of just stumbled into it. I was in an environmental science program at the University of New Hampshire. And then, I stumbled across this book about earthships. And it was these people who were building homes literally out of all recycled materials, basically out of trash.

The principles behind it were the things that sort of inspired me. I decided to go out and get my own contractor's license and eventually built a small company. The thing that I really love about what I do is sort of creating something out of nothing. If you feel happiness on a day-to-day basis, you're succeeding in life.",4,424,158
"Okay. So this is a story of, I guess, one of my big hobbies. At least, it\'s less big now, but it was definitely like a big thing I did last year. My sister and I started playing Pokemon Go. And it started off just because one of my sisters, the oldest one, we\'ll call her K. She actually doesn\'t matter. But anyways, my older sister downloaded the app, and she was like, ""This is so cool. You have to download it, too."" And then that\'s kind of how it started. But basically, Pokemon Go is this app that is like closely related to the game and the anime cartoon called Pokemon. So it\'s like a world of where people train these Pokemon that are kind of like wild animals with magical powers or like superpowers. And they train them and they use them for battle. And it\'s a whole competition between one trainer and their pets/monsters/animals against another one. And it\'s like training to know, basically it\'s like who knows their pets the best and can use them and their unique abilities. So anyway, Pokemon Go tries to be similar. It basically brings the show to life, and it blew up a couple of years ago when it first launched because Pokemon has a huge fan base, like people who are super dedicated and some that are less. But I never got into it because I just didn\'t have the proper phone for it. But now that I have a better quality phone and I had free time last year, that\'s when I really got into Pokemon Go. So basically, this game takes place in the real world, also, where it forces you to walk around and map out little places to catch these Pokemon monsters. So it brings their real world to life. And so it actually really did bring the real world to life because my sisters and I are blue team, like at least we call her blue team. And because we got so into it, we started seeing common players around our neighborhood because it turns out that other people around us played also. And every park or public space becomes a space for Pokemon Go. So parks are like a common space where you can train your Pokemon. You put them in little gyms, like a whole thing. But basically, my sister, sisters, and I became the Blue team. And we called ourselves the Triple Threat because there were three of us. And we would always play together. We would match our outfits. And we would match Pokemon. So once we took over a gym from the other teams, there\'s two other teams, there\'s Yellow and red. Yellow is Team Instinct. Red is Team Valor. And then what team are we? Mystic. Mystic. Basically, there are all these teams. And we were the blue team. We call ourselves the Triple Threat because we were, like, always together playing Pokemon Go. But then I think people caught onto us. And the red team specifically created their own team. And we never met these people in real life. Okay. So my sister and I developed this rivalry with this virtual gang. And basically, this team was, they also started dressing alike, and we\'re not entirely sure if they all know each other. Our best guess is they mostly know each other because they all sometimes are in the same gym together, but sometimes they\'re not. And then they would match Pokemon. And when they beat up our Pokemon, they would match sometimes. Similarly. So we developed this whole online rivalry with this team, and we would kick them out of the gym and then be strategic to not let them put in their Pokemon. We were like, full-on battling these people. And I think it\'s even funnier because, where I live, I live in the hood of Phoenix. So I tried all my life to avoid gangs. And here I am, in a virtual one that\'s like not even serious. But yes, I think it was funny the whole summer we had that little rivalry. But then I think once the summer ended, we all kind of got really busy because then I got started on like a full-time job I had. And then everyone else went back to school. So I think this rivalry we had, I\'m pretty sure it\'s with a bunch of teenagers. And we\'re, like, older. But that is the summer I joined a Pokemon gang, and we had a whole turf war in our little neighborhood.","It was the finals of my competitive match with my online buddies. We had practiced a lot online and in LAN tournaments to prepare for the finale. Sometimes we would have timeout members when some of us get tired and unfocused. I loved the memory because it was my 2nd competitive scene match, and it was my other friend's very first match! We all were looking forward to this moment and what way to make it even better than to figure out it was for real money! Someone had hosted our match and put up $500 for the winners, split evenly of course. You can say there was more pressure, but for sure, it was nice to see our video game endeavors were finally paying off!

My pro buddy didn't like how my other friend was brand new. He barely had any experience, and he said he was going to cost us the match. I asked my pro buddy to give him a chance and to represent us! He said it was all up to me because I was the one who created the hosting.

Fast forward game day, we had practiced for a while and were ready to play. Game starts, and we are up a heavy lead (3 vs 6). We start choking, and we lose the lead big time (6 vs 12). We start grinding, and it, of course, becomes overtime for both the teams (15 vs 15). It ultimately goes to 1 vs 1 with my new friend being the last alive. He magically clutches it, and we win the round and the prize pool of $500!",4,889,310
"Oh, so, I guess for my sister\'s plans for today, like how we\'re going to take her to University. And I think a lot of it really reminds me of my first time going to College alone. Well, I didn\'t go to College alone, but basically, I was the first in my family to go to University outside of state. My sister, my older sister was the oldest. One and the first one to go to College ever because my family. No one really holds degrees. Where they\'re like Immigrants to the us. So it\'s like a whole complication thing there with education, not transferring or not going to University because it\'s expensive. So I feel really privileged to be to have been one of the first in my family to go to College. But it\'s definitely really hard because my parents don\'t have the same background as they don\'t have the same understanding of what it means to go to College in the US or what College really is. So it would be hard to relate with other friends that do have family and support system so. It really so I guess. It\'s like me thinking back about when I was first going through wellesley. So I went to Wales College in Massachusetts. So I\'m from Arizona. So that\'s a huge flight. It\'s like 6 hours flight. And pretty much the day I got dropped off or the weekend I got dropped off, I think it\'s super memorable in my mind because. It was me, two of my sisters, and my mom. So it\'s like all four of us were going, we couldn\'t really afford flights for other people. And it was kind of to me, a miracle that we could afford these flights to Massachusetts. It was thanks to my sister\'s good paying job at the time, but really I was surprised anyone could go. I was prepared to go by myself because we didn\'t really have much money. We took an overnight flight similar to this, but it was a direct flight, but they didn\'t sleep. But I can sleep through anything. So I slept through the flight. I don\'t know. I don\'t remember how many days we were there, but I think it was just very rushed and. It was like chaotic. Because we went so we had it over. And I thought, ""Can you kick Elvis out? He\'s kind of, thank you."" So I just see it as like a whirlwind, like I don\'t even remember really how the event unfolded. I just remember going overnight and then landing in Boston, and it was my first time in Boston with my family first time exploring. So then. I got to explore Boston that day, like I had a whole itinerary planned. I think that was like one of the starts of my travel crazy. The travel bug had a whole itinerary. I had my parent or my mom and my older sisters and everyone, like running through Boston, trying to get everything done as much as possible. For only one day. And then we went to the hotel, slept. And then the next day we went to wellesley. And it was just like a really cool experience to have them move me in. So I didn\'t have to do it alone. They helped move me in, and it was like the hottest day in Massachusetts. It just felt gross. And it was humid growth. And we\'re not used to humidity at all. So everything felt so sticky and stuffy. And there\'s no air conditioning in any of the dorms that well, we at least at the time, pretty much still not. So then there are no dorm, like there\'s no air conditioning. So it was like we\'re all hot and sweaty. And then I was meeting my roommate for the first time. And the room was so tiny. It was so small, we could all barely fit. And I just remember things like it was so crazy. The whole day was very hot and chaotic. And then. Afterwards, after we set up my Bay, we took, like, a photo. And it was like, oh, really cute of us all together. And then we got to meet my roommate, which is pretty cool because she\'s Colombian. So it was nice that my mom was able to speak like her native language with my roommates. There wasn\'t a language barrier for them, and they felt like more entrusting that I was going to stay with their daughter. It was just a nice experience. It\'s really nice when my. Friends or my friend\'s family speaks Spanish because then my parents can relate to them on a better level than English. So I was really thankful for that. So I just remember it being just very hot and humid and gross. But we got it all set up. And then we went to maybe a couple of us. It really is a blur. Like, I just feel like from the moment that we set up the better then it was like, okay, time to kick the parents out. Go away. So then. My parents and my sisters left. And then I stick back. And then it was like. A whole weird initiation ceremony that all these students have. But Yeah. It was just like very chaotic. Two to three days, maybe. But. It was definitely a good worthwhile experience for being the first. For being dropped off and on my own for the first time. To kind of fend for myself in life. Well, the wilderness. I don\'t know. So it was really cool. So this is what my current plan for today reminds me of, they remind me of this experience of being dropped off at University. And just kind of navigating it on my own from there.","We were driving in the car, and my father was just making conversation and said, ""So, what do you want?"" ""To study?"" I said, ""Um, well, you know, I think I want to study philosophy.""

And my mother was a philosopher. So he pulled the car over, looked back at me, and said, ""When you finish your medical residency, you can do anything you want.""

You know, I think all immigrant families understand this to an extent, that your parents want you to do something safe. Have a skill that no one can take away from you, no matter what.

So I ended up being able to do that which I most wanted to do anyway, but I went through it, through the sciences. Following your dreams is one thing, but you're going to be much better at following your dreams if you have some sort of skill. And that paying your dues and getting some sort of rigorous training so that you actually know how to do something is very much worthwhile.",3,1137,209
"Story, okay. I don't have a story first, per se, but I think I just have a lot of emotions that I'm working through right now, and I just feel like. I don't know, tearing up a bit. But I guess I'm just worried for the rest of this month. I just feel overwhelmed with how many birthday celebrations there are. I know it's funny, but I don't know. I just feel like there are so many birthdays in my family. And then there's also my birthday, and I'll be turning 24, which is weird because I feel like, wow, I'm actually growing up. Now my age is showing. It's because I always felt very mature for my age. But now I'm like, oh, I'm not still young, but I feel like, wow, I'm getting older. I'm 24. So I think I just feel overwhelmed by the amount of, like, I guess gifts I have to buy and just the events you have to show up for. I think like parties and that I'm not in the greatest place financially, just given the type of jobs my family works. And then, even though I have a degree from like a really good university, I don't have a high-paying job. I'm working at the bakery, which is minimum wage. There are a lot of goals on the side I'm saving up for. So I just feel overwhelmed by trying to save money towards the goals that I'm working towards, but then also paying bills. And then trying to buy gifts and stuff for celebrations for my family and people who have birthdays in September. I swear I have like eight birthdays in December, and it's like a little overwhelming. Maybe even more because I have friends who are also in September, and I feel bad not getting them gifts, but... Yeah, I think I'm just overwhelmed with, I guess, the social, financial connection. Like, to hang out with people, you have to spend money. And I just feel like I'm still trying to save money and I want to say get back on my feet. I don't know. I have a lot of worries in my mind. And I did have, after I graduated from university, I did have a good-paying job for a couple of months. Because the company, it was just not a good company. It was just a really stressful work environment. But I was getting paid, like, double what I make now in terms of hourly wage. And I guess sometimes I just get stuck thinking like, wow, I really left that job. It was paying me well, for given that I didn't have other benefits. I feel like it was paying me relatively well compared to, like, it was the most amount of money I've ever made in my life, but I'm also young. And I don't come from a lot of financial, I don't come from much financial privilege. So it's like I still have complicated feelings with accepting or forgiving myself. I don't know what it's forgiving, but if you can go came with leaving a job that paid me more money, and then feeling more limited financially despite graduating from like a prestigious university. I just have a lot of worries right now connected to finances and birthday celebrations and trying to still spend time with friends and family, but trying to save up for goals I have but then also paying bills and try not to let it get to me, but it's like a lot. And I'm not the only one feeling like this. I know my family definitely feels pressure. I think there's just a lot of with the expenses right now, I think inflation is really high. Groceries are very high. It just feels like the cost of living is so expensive now. I know I'm not alone, but that also really sucks because it makes me feel like when can we escape this cycle of struggling? Like, what? Will I have enough money to feel comfortable and not worry about paying bills? And the crazy part is like even with the college degree, it's just wild. So I just have all these complicated feelings attached to leisure and finances and goals and relationships, and I'm having a hard time coping with that. It comes in waves, but yeah. So I have all those worries. I don't know if you have... It's just rough.","I always have felt behind in my life compared to my friends and other people I know. I'm 17 and I can't drive, I've never had a boyfriend, and I don't know what my plans are for the future. I felt so bad, like I was lesser than.

But this summer I got a job, and since there was no school, and it was under the table. I worked six days a week, like 60 hours a week. I was just going through the motions.

And here I am today, checking my bank account for the first time, and I have a balance of $7,636.41. I can't believe I earned that! It feels SO good! None of my friends have jobs, and they always have to ask their parents for money, but here I am with this hefty loft!

And then also today, I finally got confirmation that I just got another job. Today is going so well! I feel like I'm really able to conquer the world and save money, and that when I move out next year, I'll know what to do. I can finally afford driving school, and I may not have any big plans, but now I'm going to get my CNA training with the Red Cross because a woman I know offered me a job to be her in-house CNA if I get training.

And after I get experience there, I can try for this healthcare agency, and I'll be able to make a higher wage traveling between locations, and I can pick what days I work and what shifts or if I even want to work at all that week.

Things are finally starting to piece together. Everything feels so clear and right. Like I have a path to go down now, and I'm doing it ALL BY MYSELF! Nobody handed anything to me, nobody helped me with this. I DID THIS!!

I just feel so proud and hopefully I can start saving for a car or I'll have to figure out how loans work.",5,888,395
"Okay, so today I want to talk about the kindness of strangers. I guess, yeah, I guess it\'s just been on my mind occasionally. About, it kind of relates to the theme of why I like to travel. So I don\'t know. So I guess, hold on. So I\'ve been thinking about the kindness of strangers, and I don\'t know why. But I have a couple of experiences from my travels because I think when I\'m traveling, that\'s when it\'s more apparent to me how much I have to rely on not just myself but rely on the kindness of people I don\'t know.\n\nAnd I guess the more recent example was one time my friend and I, she had a job in Barcelona, so I visited her. And so from Barcelona, we took an overnight bus to Bordeaux, France. And it was like kind of not a great bus trip. It was very cold for no reason. And it was just wild or very hot. It was just uncomfortable. But during one of the 3:00 a.m. bus stops, we had like, at 3:00 a.m., we got to go to the bus to the restroom. And I don\'t know, the guy, the bus driver would only speak to me in French. And I was like, I don\'t know French. And I already did not have a good impression of France because everyone I\'ve ever met who\'s gone to France just tells me about how rude they are and how such bad experiences they had in France. So I never want to go to France in my life. But it was the cheapest place her and I could afford to go. So then we went. And it was just, I guess that kind of helped change my perspective on French people, at least in Southern France, because I didn\'t really have a rude experience. I kind of did. But I feel like strangers made up for it. And strangers kind of helped me out because the bus driver only spoke to me in French. And I know Spanish. So I tried Spanish. My friend and I, our strategy was to only talk in Spanish to French people. Because we thought like maybe they\'ll have less bias against us, maybe they have a bias against Americans. Because the bus driver only spoke to me in French, and he knew a little bit of English. But I was like, what is happening? And it was just weird. This guy stepped in and translated because he realized I spoke Spanish. So he basically translated what the guy was telling me, the bus driver was telling me in French to Spanish. And then I started talking to him and got to know a little bit about him. It turns out he was from like, Venezuela, and he was living in France, and he was helpful in giving us advice about what to do in Bordeaux. It was really kind and I think, I don\'t know. I feel like he might be, maybe he was hitting on me or something because he ended up asking for my number or whatever, but I brushed it off because I was alone. My friend went to the bathroom without me, and I was like, this is awkward. But later on, in the same bus ride, there was like no set scheduled. This was like a rogue bus trip. It just seemed like this bus wasn\'t really doing good announcements of what stop we were on. So you just had to keep track of where you were and where you\'re getting off. And this woman, she sat next to me. I really didn\'t have an empty seat and she sat next to me and she was French. But she was speaking to me in English after I told her I don\'t speak French. I\'m sorry. And she was just nice and she helped me practice some French translations. And then, after when it got to my bus stop, I realized that she had woken me up because I was already kind of waking up because I wasn\'t sure if that was our bus or not because we had gone into our stop early. And it was just nice because she woke me up and she\'s like, ""Hey, is this your stop?"" And it was just really nice that she did that. And then it turns out that the guy, the guy from Venezuela, I saw him look back to make sure. I think he was looking back to make sure I was awake and then saw me then turned away. Even I didn\'t get to say bye but, I was just kind of like surprised that, oh, these people were looking out for me, making sure I was getting off at the right stop, because clearly I didn\'t know what I was doing, like me and my friend didn\'t know what we were doing. And then that\'s just like one of many examples of random kindness.\n\nOn another bus ride to Italy. I know a little bit of Italian but I definitely was like, I was kind of confused about where I was on the map and when I was going to meet my friend in rural Italy. And I thought it was nice that I asked around like ""We\'ll stop at this"" in Italian and then people were also confused. But then the bus driver, I guess I thought it was really kind of him, because the assistant when he realized like, ""Oh yeah, this girl does not, she\'s not local. She has no idea where she\'s going, she\'s going to the middle of nowhere, Italy"". I guess when he realized that he made sure that I was getting off at the stop, because he made sure to ask me, ""What stop am I getting off at?"" So yeah, it was just nice that they were looking out. I really appreciate moments when locals or other people look out for me. And then it makes me want to give back in that way. And like some ways I\'ve done that have been like there was one time I got sick in Portugal. I just did a lot of traveling this past year, yeah. So it was in Portugal with my friend and I got sick randomly. So we\'re hoping it wasn\'t COVID. And thankfully it wasn\'t. And I got like really strong medicine, cough drops, like really strong. They worked really well. And then I was getting over it. But then this woman in our hostel, she was coughing a lot. And she only spoke Portuguese. And I wanted to help her out. So then I spoke Spanish and I know that you can speak Spanish and Portuguese and mutually understand each other to some extent. So while she was only speaking to me in Portuguese, I only spoke to her in Spanish. And I told her like, ""Oh, I have these cough drops. They\'re going to help your throat. Take them. They\'re here. They\'re from Portugal. They\'re not from another country"". And then so she was very thankful and we got to talking. And she added me on Instagram. And she was an older woman, I think she\'s like in her 40s, maybe 50s. I think 40s. So I repaid it then, like, I repaid the favor of looking out for other people. Another time in Turkey, this guy was like, he had no charge on his phone. And he had no charger, I guess his charger had died. And he asked me for a charger and I was like, ""Oh, I actually have an extra, you can keep"". So I gave him an extra one. It was like a cheaper one. It was like the randomest thing. And I was like, ""Okay, here. You\'re not going to find us here"". I don\'t know. So yeah, I helped him that way. So it\'s nice to have been helped on these travels and then to also pass it along and help other people. So I think traveling restores my faith in humanity a bit when I get to connect with locals and when I have these authentic experiences.","Today, I was working my evening shift and I got an extra-large pizza delivered at my work for me and all of my co-workers to have something to eat. About 7:00 p.m., this woman came in and she had gotten two donuts. I saw her digging through her bag for change to pay me with. She had enough change to get the two donuts. She went and sat down to eat her donuts. She looked homeless.

Something in me told me she was hungry, and I remembered there was pizza leftover in the break room. I told my coworker that I wanted to ask her if she wanted some pizza, but I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. My coworker just said ask her if she's hungry. So, I went and asked her if she wanted some leftover pizza I had bought earlier for lunch. She said that she would love some pizza, so I went and got her some and warmed it up in the microwave.

I brought the pizza out to her, and she thanked me. Then, I just continued working and finishing the things I needed to before my shift ended. Around 8:00, I started cleaning the grill at my workplace. I turned around to grab a rag, and the woman I gave the pizza to was standing there.

She explained to me that she hadn't eaten in a few days and thanked me again and told me that if I give her a rag, that she would go clean the bathrooms for me. I wanted to just hug this woman at this point because she was willing to go clean a dirty bathroom for some food. I explained to her that it was my job to do that, and that the only thing she needed to do was to take care of herself and stay safe out in the world.

This took me off guard today because this woman was hungry. I gave her food, and she was trying to do something in return when she didn't have to. I also told her that she needed to stay warm out there because it's getting cold. Before she left, she thanked me again and told me that it was kind of me to give her food and how much she appreciated it.

Strangers can make us realize how blessed we are when we can't see it ourselves.",5,1582,443
"Okay. So I wanted to talk about cultural differences and the concept of time because I think it\'s very interesting. And I think it\'s something that people overlook, at least in a diverse place like the United States where we have people from different cultures and different backgrounds. I think sometimes our miscommunications tend to be because of our cultural differences and awareness and difference in experiences. Anyways, I think a lot of it\'s misunderstandings. But I think one of my, sorry, let me just. Okay. So I think one of my most recent experiences was when I went to Japan for a couple of days because I traveled a lot this year, thankfully. And one of the spontaneous trips was to Japan, and it was me and my friend and her sister, the same friend Re. So Me, Ari, and her sister were together. And we\'re all Mexican Americans. Our families are from Mexico. So our concept of time is more laid back, more like, oh, yeah, it\'s okay if we show up 15-20 minutes late, maybe a little bit later. So we\'re more flexible with time and meetings. All of the Americans are a little bit more punctual, so it\'s always a duality we had to deal with, but in this case, we took a more laid back approach. And we were traveling with her friend who\'s Korean. So she\'s Korean and about our age. And she described Korean time as being like, only ten minutes late, max. She was like, you can be five minutes away, you could be ten minutes away, but max. Okay. She was like, you have to be punctual and not more than ten minutes late. And this morning, it was the morning that we were going to DisneySea because she wanted to go to Disney. C. It was her dream to go to DisneySea. We had planned to meet the Korean friend, eugene. So her Korean friend brought her friend who\'s Japanese. Okay. And it was our first time going to meet him. And it was going to be very exciting because it\'s like, wow, we\'re in Japan with someone who\'s Japanese. And then eugene speaks Japanese. So that would help with the language barrier. So in the morning, we\'re getting ready. We stayed up late because we\'re fools and then we woke up and it was a rush to get ready because everyone gets ready at different speeds. Like, I take about an hour, one of my friends takes a long time, oh my gosh, it takes so long. The Korean friend takes so long. And then the other friend, the sister, is quick. So we all have different speeds of getting ready. And then on top of that, we didn\'t realize the different concepts of time. Like, whenever eugene would say, we have to leave at 7:10 because it would be an hour commute, she said, we have to leave at seven. And in my head, I was like, why do I think that\'s enough? It\'s going to be fine; trains come so quickly here. It\'s going to be fine to catch the next one. But then I went to go grab food or even before I went to grab breakfast from the 7-Eleven, I realized, I was like, Wait, guys, we have to hurry. We\'re meeting a Japanese person. They\'re on time if not early. And then that\'s when we all started freaking out because by all, it\'s like me and the other two Mexican Americans were like, we have to hurry now because it\'s like, we can\'t be disrespectful to this person who we are meeting for the first time. We were laughed because we were like, we\'re running on Mexican time. We have to hurry up. We have to hurry up. So it became like this mad rush to hurry to leave exactly at the time eugene said because eugene was just being very polite and was like, yeah, we should leave at like, seven. We should leave at seven. And then now that we have this understanding of like, oh, her friend\'s going to show up early, we cannot be disrespectful and show up late. So we\'re like, we have to go now. So it was like a mad rush. We were running to the station and then we were panicked the whole time. And at the same time that we were kind of like anxious that we were going to be late, our friend was teaching us Japanese phrases that we would be familiar with. And one of them was, I don\'t know if I\'m pronouncing it right, but it was something along the lines of ""it\'s very nice to meet you for the very first time"". So that was another cultural nuance because we were practicing on that train ride. Like, we had to get it right. It was our first time, and the only time we could ever say it to him. Because you can\'t say that again. We finally did. We missed, like, one train, I think. And then we finally made it to the station and we were actually early. We were actually like, early on the time that we had said, and we were so proud of ourselves. We were like, oh, we did it. But it definitely was one of the most poignant examples of cultural differences and how it could be very different when you\'re traveling with people from different cultures because you have a different understanding of time, and then there\'s also, and it was very interesting because throughout the day I really noticed different understandings of how we approach eating and how we talk about beauty. But that was through conversations and we talked from the lens of Mexico, then America, the United States, and then Japan and Korea. So it was like, I guess a very insightful day for understanding cultural nuance. And so that\'s something I really appreciate and really enjoy doing when I travel. So I\'m really appreciative that I got that experience firsthand. And I think it\'s hilarious that we were like, we\'re running on Mexican time. We have to be punctual, we have to be early. Especially on this vacation that me and my friend Ari have been very laid back with on time. This was the one time that we were like, it matters. And it doesn\'t matter just to us, but to other people in our itinerary.","One time, I had a coworker who would constantly use the phrase ""like I said"". I would estimate he said that phrase about 100 times a day at work to various people.

For example, pretend he was training you on a task that involved about 50 steps. Here's how he would typically talk:

You: So on step 9, do we have to ensure step 7 passed first?

Him: Like I said, steps 8 and 9, you have to do that, yes. Also, like I said, please bring up questions when we haven't moved to the next step first.

You: Great, I know what to do now.

Him: Also, like I said, I hope you're keeping notes on all of this. Since, like I said, it's nice if we don't have repeated questions in these meetings.

Personally, I think it's rude because about half of the time he would explain something complex one time or maybe even not at all. So, I feel like it shows impatience. Maybe I'm wrong though, and other people think it's normal to talk like this.",3,1270,223
"I want to talk about the Great Floods of 2021. Yes. Okay. So basically, I live in Phoenix, and Phoenix is a desert, and we don\'t get a lot of rain for most of the year, except... Well, it\'s even worse than that with climate change. But previously, we would get these heavy monsoon seasons. So, July and August, it would rain really heavily. And because our soil isn\'t like other soils that soak up water really well, a lot of it\'s like hard, compact, and the water just tends to stay. So we have these things called flash floods. And they happen spontaneously when it rains a lot and it happens in different places. And so, several times in my life, there\'s been times where it would rain so, so hard that certain places would just be flooded. And one time it rained so hard when I was like in high school that our school day was canceled. And it\'s kind of funny to think, like, in a desert, it rains so hard in a desert, you get school canceled. But it\'s actually like a big thing. And so in 2021, we had just moved into this new house, or a new house to us. So it was my first time ever moving home in my life. So I was unfamiliar with kind of like what to expect in a new place. And it rained. Okay. So it was okay. So we moved in July, which is like the worst time to ever move in Phoenix because it\'s so hot. It\'s like 115 degrees, a lot of the year, a lot of the month. So, then moving when you\'re in and out, in and out is horrible. It sucks. And so we had just gone through that month of exhaustion of moving things, and then it being hot because we\'re trying to get used to the AC system. And then, suddenly, it started to rain really hard. It started to rain. Maybe, I think it was like the end of July. It was definitely still the summer. And it rained so, so hard that our backyard became a pond or like a mini Lake. And my dad had, because we were still moving, my dad had a bunch of stuff in the back, and the rain basically it was drowning in the water. And I thought I could save it. I was like, ""Don\'t worry, dad. I\'ll get your stuff."" My dad didn\'t care. I think he had just given up on the stuff from the exhaustion of moving. But I went outside with my rain jacket and then my shorts and my water shoes. And I was, like, pulling stuff. And then my sister joined me. But then my older sister yelled at both of us. And she was like, ""Get out of the water! You\'re going to get electrocuted!"" But it was funny. So, we took photos. The reason she said I was going to get electrocuted was because our home is like the corner of our house is the electrical unit of our neighborhood, so it\'s, like, not a street light, but it\'s the giant light poles, whatever, that run current. And we never had that in our yard before. In our old house, it was, like, in the alley. So the space between homes. But here, this is our first home where we had, like, wall to wall space with the house. So we had that power line in our backyard, and she was like, ""Get out, you\'ll get electrocuted!"" But I think it was funny because we had opened the doors and the windows, and you could just see our front yard was, like, a little mini river of all the water going downstream. And I also wanted to hang out in the water, and I forgot what I did. I think I made, like, a boat or something. I made something to try to float. But at some point, our backyard filled up so much that even our dogs, like our dogs, were looking at the ocean. And I have photos of our dogs sitting, gazing out into what was our lawn. And how is the ocean for them? And it was just so cute because my little dog was still alive back then. And she was just looking out into the abyss of water. And then I think it also became funny because, okay, in retrospect, it\'s funny, but when you\'re kind of going through it, you\'re kind of stressed. But the flooding, the water was rising really, really high up because we learned this later. So it turns out that our house was on an incline. And the fence we had was a wooden fence. So all the water that our neighbors had was swept down to us. And when we looked over to our neighbor\'s homes, it was dry. But we had all the water. So we collected all the water. So, later on, we, like a year or two later, we fixed this by having a brick wall to prevent that from happening. But because it was just, like, all following through, that\'s where all the water came, and it started to get into the house. And we started panicking and screaming, like, ""It\'s getting inside! It\'s getting inside!"" And we had never dealt with flooding before. So then I ran to grab all the towels we had. I started shoving it along the side, and then the pets didn\'t know what to do either. They were kind of useless. And it was also raining diagonally. So then, that\'s why the water was going into our living space. But finally, we were able to mop. Okay. But we were, like, rinsing the rags out and taking a lot of the water out, and it worked out. And the rain stopped. And Arizona\'s rain tends to gaslight you. Like, it would rain really hard. And then ten minutes after, it stops raining, it\'s like the water is gone. Nothing ever happened. All your fears of water and drowning were nonexistent at that point because the sun dried everything up. So that\'s kind of what happened. As soon as it stopped raining, the sun came out, and it kind of dried up all the rain. Rainy Spider song but just in a way quicker manner. And then, it\'s always funny to look back at all the photos because it\'s like, ""Wow, we really were out there in the water trying to save things that my dad didn\'t even care about."" And people, every time there\'s a flooding like that, people post random Snapchat, random social media posts of how people spent their time in the water. This water is gross, but people are still out there playing like I was. And so, I saw videos of people floating down the street in, like, an air mattress or tube. So people make the best out of the rain, although it\'s arguably dangerous because of the electrical current, like wiring. And then, if you\'re floating down a river in an air mattress, who\'s to say you\'re not going to run into a car that\'s, like, trying to also go through the water? The Floods of 2021 were a crazy time. And we learned from it to be more prepared for next time. And I think, and it hasn\'t rained that hard since. And having the brick wall helped a lot. So now the water doesn\'t go in as much.","I've never had to prepare for a hurricane before, and it's not about what I need, but I am also in a sketchy situation: a home by the coast. I can't even afford to PREPARE for this! I used my last dollars on bills this month, and I am totally screwed.

I went to the local Walmarts and Publixes, and there's no water! I feel like I couldn't even prep if I could afford to. Honestly, I wish I had the money for just even one of these little hurricane kits I'm seeing on the news. I'm just stressed.

And what also is going to piss me off is when I'm here and I'm stuck, I always see people victim-blaming online after these kinds of disasters. People say they had time, they should've just left town. Not everyone can afford it. If I can't afford to go get a bunch of cases of water and a flashlight, what makes you think that I can afford to leave town and stay at a hotel?

I'm glad I'm a good swimmer. That's all I'm gonna have, I guess. That and my sense of humor to get through this one.

Good luck to everyone else in my situation. It's about to be rough, but you aren't alone.",3,1509,259
"Okay. So, I guess it's not so much of a story kind of, but I wanted to talk through some kind of feelings I've been feeling about the job hunt. I think it feels a little bit more magnified because today at work, the work at my bakery, I felt micromanaged. Yeah, I felt micromanaged by one of the workers. It's just a weird schedule. I'm supposed to be on my own, it's just two workers out of the four cake decorators. And because I'm new, the other one, I guess felt more inclined to try to help me, but I felt annoyed. I felt very micromanaged. And I guess it was just hard because she wanted me to speed up and go faster, but I don't want to, which I know it's like a bakery, fast-paced environment, but I'm like, I'm getting paid minimum wage. It can't be that serious. I don't get a bonus if I sell more. What's the incentive to really speed up, to not get fired? That doesn't seem like enough incentive for me to really try beyond the bare minimum. Yeah, especially like I don't have enough hours. So whatever. So I guess that experience today once again reminded me, like, I need to find another job. I mean, the worker didn't mean anything bad. Like, I really like her. I just think she was a little bit too on top of it. I guess it made me think more about the job hunt and how I've been very slow to apply to other jobs, where I can basically hire paying jobs that require a degree, white-collar jobs, whatever. So, yeah. It made me think about why it's going to take a while. And part of it has been like adjusting to change. Well, first it was, I don't know. I guess maybe I'm running out of excuses, and I think there's more to it than what I thought originally was making me stop. Because first it was like, oh, I had to get quick money, not quick money, but I had to have some source of income. I'm not going to be unemployed for much longer because I spent a lot of my money on travel. So first it was, get a quick job. Then it was like, learn this quick job so I can be comfortable and start applying on the side. And then I feel comfortable in it. But now, and then it was like, adjust to your little sister going to college. But then now I'm like, okay, what's the excuse for being very slow? And part of it was like me just trying to enjoy my time in Phoenix. Like my friends and family, just because I've always had a hard time or a hard relationship with the city or just like my place of birth. I don't know. I always had weird feelings about this city, and I never really felt like I belonged. Now it's like, oh, I'm actually building that sense of belonging, even though I've been here, like, a whole year later, because I worked remotely. I guess one reason why it's taking me so long in the job hunt is because I was trying to build community, and I was spending all my money going out. So kind of hard to find a balance. All my waiting time is going to going out and building community. And then the other part is I guess as I've been looking at browsing at jobs and besides the limitations of not having a driver's license, I'm trying to get creative with how I can swing it, probably just more remote roles. So it's just like a combination of things that discourage me, so not having a driver's license really does impact availability jobs in Phoenix or where I can get around if I don't always have a secure ride and I don't always want to be paying Ubers and lifts. And then another part is like, I guess this is a part. I guess I've been realizing more that the job hunt started to get like a little bit emotional. But the job hunt makes me frustrated of thinking about my last job because I was with the company for three years. And then I turned full time in October. And I mentioned my salary previously. It was wrong. So I was making more than that. But it was like my first big paying paycheck out of college. I don't know. So I just feel like doing the job search makes me feel frustrated because I really feel cheated. I really feel like my last company really sucked. And I don't know how to grapple with those feelings because they do good work. And I always knew I wasn't going to stay long at that company. I just feel like I got such a short end of the stick, and it really sucks because I feel like I'm just a recent college grad, and I feel like I don't know. So the company really pushes on Hispanic, Latino people, like breaking through barriers, going to higher up positions in their company, so it's very marketed with Hispanic, Latino identity and roles outside of service and outside of like I guess I don't know. It's very professional, like white-collar outlook for Latinos and Hispanic people. So I guess. I just feel cheated because the mission is really valuable for what we were working with in our companies, and it was key on mentorship and networking. So it's like I learned so much from that job and. I guess I wish I could have left when I was still on good terms with everyone. I think for the most part I am, but I think my view of them is all tainted. Like one of the coworkers. I think her specifically, she's really gotten under my skin. I think the job relates to me still having mixed feelings about my last job because it's just so crazy. I keep reading all these job descriptions and thinking like, wow, my company didn't have any benefits. We had a birthday bonus or like a week between New Year's and Christmas off, but we didn't have health care. We didn't really have. We had unlimited PTO, but that kind of was a scam. And I always got criticism for taking time off and then I guess I'm just worried like, what if my next job. I don't suss up the red flags. I don't suss them out beforehand and I just walk into another mess. I'm really worried about that. But then I know I'll just quit. I'll just keep applying for jobs until I can trust it. But this job is so agonizing. I didn't realize how much emotion is behind it. And I guess that's what I'm working through. It's just like seeing all these job descriptions making me realize like, wow, my last company was like, they didn't really have any benefits. And then I felt so judged. And I felt like, especially towards the end, they really just gave me a bunch. They gave me things to do and didn't really train me on it. And they had all these, specifically, my boss. I think this is targeted towards my boss and my coworker who's my arch-nemesis now because I feel like both of them put all this pressure on me and didn't really adequately train me. And also, the coworker kind of low-key sabotaged me or tries to sabotage me, and she was really good at it. She was really good at trying to sabotage me. So I guess I'm just worried about all the mind games I have to play at the next role. And just really feeling like, wow, I could have gotten a whole year of experience with them, or I could have had more marketable skills if I had stayed there longer if I was able to stay longer. But I really felt, I guess bullied in a way and really left out and really. Yeah. I feel like my boss kept saying things that made me feel like I wasn't doing a good enough job. But then when I spoke to other people I worked with, they were like other people who aren't directly in the company. They made it so that. They made it sound like I was doing a great job, and I was going above and beyond. So I'm just kind of so disappointed that. The people that I got close to or at least my core team, I feel like towards the end, I just felt so mistreated by them and not this job. And then one of the reasons I guess I have a hard time filling out applications is because I just get wrapped up in the emotion behind it. I don't know. Reading job descriptions, I'm like, damn, I was cheated. I didn't even get a job offer letter. Who the fuck doesn't give their employee a job offer letter? I had to advocate for that, and I had to write my own job description, like I had to do so much for myself. And I'm like, but they're not even skilled, and I don't feel adequate enough to really market myself for these applications. I mean, I'll probably just be like, yeah, I did it. And exaggerate my skills, but I really feel like they failed me. And I haven't gotten over it. I'm kind of frustrated that I haven't gotten over it because it's been months. And you would think traveling around Europe would cure your problem. You would think having the privilege of travel to escape your problems would actually help you address stuff","About 5 months ago, I quit my good job up in Virginia, sold my home, and moved back down to Florida. It all started out 4 years ago when my Uncle, who owns a couple of event planning companies, asked me to come work for him since his main company just received a huge contract from the federal government. I said yes right away and quit my job as an assistant manager at a hotel and left for Virginia to work for him. He offered to let me stay in his basement, which was just a really nice downstairs apartment. I was very grateful and stayed with him for a year until I saved enough money to get into my own place.

At first, I really enjoyed the job and put in my best effort. The two owners, my Uncle and his best friend, were very happy with my performance. I was given a 50% raise after only six months on the job. After a year, I was promoted and given another significant raise.

After being promoted, I was put under the supervision of a new boss. She was very good at her job but unfortunately was not good with the people working under her. She would talk very badly behind our backs and would not think twice about throwing us under the bus if it would keep her from looking bad. I worked for her for a couple of years until finally I and a few others had had enough.

I complained to my Uncle and his best friend, who was also my old supervisor. They did not believe that she was such a problem. My work ethic started to decline because I was very discouraged by it all. I started to not take things seriously and then began to spiral out of control to a certain extent. I was not the only one on the team with this issue.

Finally, I tried to quit several times but was guilted into staying on the job. Then over the course of one week, I purposely did not show up for a few days until they were forced to fire me. It was a hard thing to deal with considering how my uncle, who I was very close to, looked out for me in several ways and because of that we became very close.

The fallout was not pleasant, and because of it all, the relationship between me and my uncle is now severely strained, and I will never work for him again.",4,1918,464
"Okay, so I guess I\'m going to talk about risk and the risk I take in my life. And I\'ve been wondering, what\'s the next step? And I always consider myself not a big risk-taker. I\'ve always considered myself someone who plays it safe all the time, who chooses the safest option and just security, just because I struggled to find that in my childhood and growing up. So I guess I made that, like, I don\'t know.\n\nI always just search for stability. But when I think back on my life and major changes I\'ve made, it\'s all been because I\'ve taken risks. And I guess that\'s a little scary. And I\'m wondering where that leaves me now that I\'m in this weird spot in my life where I\'m in between careers and trying to get my footing back in Phoenix. And learning new skills at the same time. So I guess that\'s what I\'ve been thinking about.\n\nThe first risk I took, if I could trace it back, was moving - transferring schools. I wanted to transfer to a school in my neighborhood that supposedly had better education compared to other schools. So I guess that was the first risk that I took. I made the initiative and encouraged my parents to take it on my behalf. It was when I was around nine or eight. And that was hard because moving schools was hard. I felt dumb at that school. I had a lot of imposter syndrome because I felt like it was much more advanced than what I knew, even though I was technically a very smart kid growing up. But then I adapted and made friends. It\'s funny to think that the friends I have now in Phoenix, that I\'m really close to, all kind of came from that elementary school experience, from fourth to eighth grade. So I think it\'s funny that that was the first risk I considered taking.\n\nAnd then another risk I guess I\'ve taken was changing schools again. I think the risks I\'ve taken have just been changes of environments. So I changed schools again in high school because the first school I went to was a complete culture shock. It was a predominantly white school, upper middle class or upper-class backer, on a different side of Phoenix. So it felt weird trying to adjust to that. And I felt like the coursework was weird, and I didn\'t feel challenged. So then I went to this internationally rigorous school. I decided to move to the internationally rigorous school, and then I had to make friends again. Maybe some things don\'t work out the way you want them to, because I felt like I had no life. Okay, I kind of did. I hung out a lot, like I had a lot of good friends for the time. Friends that got me through college, I mean, fucking school.\n\nAnd then I took another risk when I went to Alaska for a summer. I was offered an opportunity to go to Alaska, and I was like, yeah, fuck it, I want to go because I\'m from Arizona. What the fuck do I know about oceans and mountains of snow? So I went, and that kind of sucked a lot. I liked the nature and the exploration part of it, and I liked learning new skills. But I had a really hard time with the group I was with, the pod I was supposed to be with all the time. They were very negative, very picky eaters, and they were expecting Alaska to be a vacation. I was like, ""Y\'all, what part of shitting in the woods made you think that we were going to be at a five-star hotel?"" I don\'t understand what happened there. It was a really hard time because I couldn\'t escape them. They were my main group, and even when I switched, I was still kind of stuck with all of them. So I guess another risk that didn\'t work out in my favor. But it made me learn more about how to deal with people who have different viewpoints in terms of food or in terms of what we were expecting out of the experience.\n\nAnd then I guess another risk was when I went to university far away from home as the first person in my family to go to college. And I was like, I need to escape, I need a change of environment. And I got it. It wasn\'t paid for fully. I had a lot to make up, but I constantly applied for scholarships to make sure I could afford to go to that school. So ultimately, I got it paid off - almost a full ride. I want to say like, 95% of my schooling was paid. So that was another risk I took.\n\nSo I guess a lot of the risks in my life have been just changing environments. Because there was little to no hope in studying abroad, but at the last minute on the last application date, I decided to go to Greece during the pandemic, like the height of the pandemic, because I really wanted to live abroad. And I was like, it\'s probably now or never. And that also didn\'t work out. It didn\'t work out the way I wanted it to. I wanted it to be more fun and exciting in a fun way. But it was exciting in a stressful way because what was I expecting? The pandemic resources were scarce. Greek people didn\'t even want us there because they were like, ""You\'re using up our resources,"" which is very valid. But I realized that at the time, I was just like, I want to change my environment. If I\'m going to be stuck in my room, I might as well be stuck in my room in Athens.\n\nAnd then another risk was also going to Denmark because I didn\'t know how it was going to work out with my degree. But I was like, I really, really want to go abroad. I want to keep living abroad and experiencing different ways of life and incorporating that into mine. So I went, and that was a lot better. Denmark was actually one of the safest risks I\'ve taken, one of the risks that took that came out the best way possible.\n\nCome on, Elvis. So that was actually one of the better risks that worked out where I got to learn, make new friends. But then it was really hard towards the end because of certain accidents that happened and people that died. But it worked out for the most part.\n\nAnd then I find myself in the latest mini-risk. I\'m still getting over my trauma with my last job, my last full-time job. It took a lot of energy and peace of mind from me, and I knew it was risky going into it. I went still because I was like, what other job offers do I have? And I just wanted money. I was just like, I want to graduate and I want to have money. I don\'t want to work through this whole stressful process. I don\'t want to relocate. I was tired of constantly changing locations. So I guess now, and then, I guess the irony. I\'m kind of like, how do I take a risk without always changing locations? I can\'t just keep moving and not running away from problems but running towards problems in a different location. Hey, don\'t do that.\n\nSo I guess whatever risk means in the context of staying in the same space for a long time. Because now I quit that job without a backup plan. Well, my backup plan was to travel. My plan was to quit this job, travel for a couple of months, come home, apply for a part-time job while I get my footing again. And that\'s exactly what I\'m doing. So I take these risks, but I take them with plans that I have in mind. But now I\'m in that weird spot where I\'m like, well, I\'m doing according to a plan. What do I do now? Or do I want to take another risk? Or do I just want to play it safe? I have this bakery job, but it doesn\'t pay well at all for the dreams I have and the hopes and the degree I have.\n\nYeah, just wondering, what does taking risk mean now that I\'m in one spot? And I see myself in the city for the next couple of years while I build up savings and build up a safety net, so that when I do leave, I can mitigate necessary risks.","I took a really non-conventional path to get where I am. I was not a model high school student, and when I finished high school, I just decided I was gonna join the Air Force and get myself out of the neighborhood I lived in. And that was how I was gonna find myself.

I wasn't sure that I really wanted to go to school. I wasn't sure that I wanted to go to college. What I was concerned about in high school was playing sports and just kinda having fun, and I wasn't really planning for the future.

I think that's something that a lot of the kids that I work with now are running into, which really helps me now because I can relate to that. You don't have to know. You don't have to know right away. Just find out what you like and try to see what surrounds that. Like, how can you embed what you like to do, what makes you happy into your life.",3,1650,195
"I don't know if it's really well, I don't really have a story in mind. I think I'm just kind of like, have a lot of anxiety involving the job search or I guess, more shame around it. Because I guess is what I had to talk out. So a coworker of mine from my last job, and there's only, like, three of them, three coworkers, so one of them reached out and was like, hey, how are you doing? Oh, yeah. He wished me happy birthday. I was like. That was a while ago, but anyways, so I guess he reached out was like we should catch up. And I guess since I got that message, it kind of just been ashamed or embarrassed about my job search. Because I left that job in April. I was just done. Now that I think back about it, I feel like it couldn't be handled the resignation better instead of just setting a resignation letter to my boss. Well, I think I did pretty good given the circumstances and how I was in the moment. So I guess I'm just, like, embarrassed that I left the job in April. And now it's October, and I'm working at a bakery in a grocery store. So I think I carry a lot of shame around my lack of professional occupation. Especially because a lot of people. Have I guess I've internalized the idea that I'm meant for something great. I think a lot of people in my life, well, I know for sure a lot of people in my life have always told me that. I'm destined for something great, that I'm meant to do something good in the world. I've been hearing this since I was young. And I guess it's like, and even my last job. Like my boss would have to say, like I'm meant to do such greater things. So I guess it's like I'm feeling the weird pressure of. Being constantly told my whole life that I'm going to achieve greatness and then having this low period in my life right now, where I'm like, okay, well, I was able to travel a lot and I met really cool people, had really cool experiences. But then now coming back to reality, working a minimum wage job or minimum wage? Isn't livable. They're cutting my hours. The cost of living is crazy. Everything's increasing in prices, my family can't really make more money. We're barely getting by. So I guess his comment, just this comment. He generally probably just wants to catch up. And he's been very supportive of my growth. And I guess I'm just embarrassed to think, like, wow, I quit this job months ago, and yet I'm stuck in a minimum wage job, working more hours for less money than when I worked over there. So yeah. I don't know what to make of it right now. So yeah. So I guess I'm just dealing with those feelings of, like, embarrassment. Especially knowing that I graduated. With such a prestigious University, and that's kind of shoved down my throat. I just remember being in Korea and meeting my friend's Korean friend's family. And them just at least especially the Korean friend talking up my school. And they're like, she went to such a really good school. And I was like, oh, my God. I'm like I graduated. Well, but at what cost. And I don't know. I feel like I have all these expectations of my future being great. And right now I don't feel like I'm professionally living up to it, but I am doing better in terms of sense of community and enjoying hobbies and free time. So I'm growing in other ways and reconnecting and things that I missed through the pandemic and through whatever shitshow was last year. But I feel kind of like, wow. Here I am, three months into a job I gave myself the five-month deadline. I was like, when I come back, it's going to take five to eight months to find a full-time job and I just have to have a job in the meantime. I don't know. I just feel me. So yeah, I ashamed, embarrassed, and just kind of, like, disappointed the reality of life and how expensive everything was. And I wish I was born rich, and I wish I was a neffle baby. Instead, I have to forge all these connections on my own because. I don't have family ties to extreme wealth. But whatever, I guess.","So, I grew up in the projects in Canarsie. Similar, I think, to the environments a lot of you might be used to: gun violence, gangs. I grew up on welfare for the first 17 years of my life. You have to find motivation to succeed every possible place you can, even if it's a negative emotion. 

When you start thinking about the negativity, about the stupid decisions you made, about the people who made you feel bad, turn that into fuel. Transmute your frustration into the fuel. 

There is this avatar or this person that says, you know, ""you're just like your mom. Your mom did nothing, you're going to be nothing, that's you."" And you go, ""I can't wait to prove this person,"" like, ""it is going to mean so much to me when that person eats every single word and they have no idea how great I am, how much I give back, how much I help others, how positive my life is."" 

So, I'm not trying to become great to then hurt this person. I'm not trying to become great to hurt someone. I'm trying to become great, and I'm trying to find every possible tool to keep me moving forward because it's so easy to want to quit.",3,924,262
"Or, wait, is he too loud? Okay, so, my story... I guess I just wanted to talk briefly about my driving experience. So, I previously have driven throughout the years, just not well. I've always had a challenge driving. I think it was mostly the lack of desire to drive. So, I've always had smaller experiences here and there, but I never went on the main road. So, I finally decided I just need to pay for driving school. I figure, if I put money into it, that's going to force me to have to do it and get my license because as I'm doing my job search, a lot of jobs I'm looking at are requiring an Arizona driver's license. So, I figured I just need it. I don't have to use it necessarily. So, the courses I paid for are four courses and let me see if I can recall the courses I paid for. My last lesson, I basically get tested and if I get 80% or higher, I get my license which I actually feel confident about because today I was driving on the main roads and I was maintaining a conversation with the driving instructor. So, I feel like that was already multitasking. And just from the preliminary grade that she gave me, I got a 60%. I didn't even know she was grading me. So, I feel like if, on my first lesson, I got a 60%, I should be able to do well next time. So, I'm on track to get my license and next time I get to do the freeway. So, yeah, I'm reaching my goals little by little.","For college, I started off in mechanical engineering. When I was back at home, my sister brought home this pamphlet that she had picked up while she was searching for schools to go and asked, have you ever made a fake ID? Have you ever built a go-kart? It was kinda just like pinpointing. Like these are the extracurricular activities that kids might be doing that would indicate they are predisposed for design school. And that was the first time I ever heard of the word design in the context of something that you can study and get a degree in.

And ultimately, that's where I decided to go back to school. All the paths into the program that I was in were very diverse and kind of meandering. If you go out there and you start doing stuff, you start encountering people who share your interests, and it may seem very important to make the right choice.

But I think more important is to kind of start with something. Maybe it's not the most refined kind of goal, but you just get out there and you start it, and you see where it takes you.",4,335,217
"Okay. So it\'s not really a happy story to tell right now, but I guess I\'ve just been feeling a little overwhelmed. With the current situation, Israel and Palestine in terms of the current war that Israel is waging on Palestine. Yeah, I guess I just wanted to talk about the overall lack of sense of power that I have, which is... I don\'t know. I just feel like I have such little power to do any change and it kind of really just sucks. I feel like the situation just overall really sucks because when I came to the war in Ukraine and Russia, everyone was on the side of Ukraine. They\'re like, ""Okay, defend your land. Protect yourself. Your heritage."" Vladimir Putin is like the obvious... like the villain. It was very like media always can support of Ukraine, so many countries with Puerto, Ukraine and their sovereignty. And then when it comes to Israel and Palestine, I feel like a sense of loss. I don\'t know, like a mind warp. Because media is sharing one side of the story. So like news, popular news outlets are showing how vulnerable Israel is and how they\'re the victim. But then what you\'ll see on the ground, like a lot of social media, I follow in Palestine and have been following for years. I didn\'t really note too much about Palestine and Israel, but I knew a little bit because I was already following creators that talked about the Palestinian cause. And I guess I\'m just... like baffled at how the media paints one picture of Israel, and then the underground roots of people who are talking and organizing show a completely different side of the story. They definitely show like Palestinians are the vulnerable population. They\'re the ones who like hospitals are being bombed with civilians are being hurt. I guess I\'m just trying to grapple with the mind fuck of it all of Western media showing Israel as like they\'re the ones defending themselves as retaliation. But... it\'s an overkill like in the literal sense. Israel has just been bombing Gaza. Nonstop. And the people there have no refuge from it. And the fact that Israel is actually committing war crimes, like bombing hospitals, bombing safe zones, cutting off power supplies. I guess the final final straw for me where I\'m like, ""Oh my God, I guess..."" The final point of despair. Like I was already slowly sinking into the form of despair. Of, like, ""Wow. Israel is bombing hospitals like they\'re not letting humanitarian aid in."" It was like all these... big things Israel was doing that were like little stabs in my heart, I don\'t know, or like in my sanity I don\'t know. I already felt the pain little by little, and I\'m very detached from it like I don\'t have much emotional connection to the region or to its unique problems. But... the more and more I kept hearing about things happening with Israel, the more I was like, ""Oh my God, this is bad."" But I think the final final straw, where I\'m literally like, ""Yeah, I need to be calling representatives. I need to be emailing and sending letters."" The final drive for me was that Israel completely bombed and decimated service to the area. So now, like Palestinians and people in Gaza, or at least people in Gaza literally cannot call anyone like they can\'t call. They can\'t text. They have no access to Internet. Like all the news outlets reporting from there have no cell service. I don\'t know how it happened. And I think that\'s the final straw for me where I\'m like, ""You literally cut off the last source of communication we have to people on the ground, people who are worrying about their families, people who are worrying about their friends. And these are war crimes. And I just feel like baffled, like we\'re not doing anything about it. The international community is completely failing people in Gaza. It is such a stark contrast from what was happening in Ukraine, how people were sending money in Ukraine, people were like, ""I\'ll host you. I\'ll give you refuge in my home."" And it\'s like, the complete opposite. And I really don\'t understand how or why. I\'m just baffled. I\'m also like, yeah, I think people see this as like a righteous religious war to some extent, like some people, I think. I don\'t know, that\'s like my very limited take on it. That people see as like, ""Oh, Israel, Christianity versus Muslims."" And then I don\'t know. I feel like that\'s to some extent, some of the comments I\'ve seen, but I\'m just like, how are we okay with this super powerful country or, now in the comparison like super powerful country completely obliterating another one. How are we as a society okay when someone who holds so much power is okay to take it out on someone who holds so little, like a big guy beating up a little kid. Like how? I\'m just, like, amazed. I don\'t know, amazed. Just baffled that we\'re okay with this. And there\'s really nothing I can do because like the US backs Israel. So I feel like I have no power. I\'m one person, one person who doesn\'t have money. I don\'t have power. I don\'t have money. I don\'t have influence. First Gen in this country. I have almost nothing to my name. What power do I really have to help in this fight? I\'m at a loss. And the most I can do is share posts on social media, and even then, that makes me a little anxious about... the amount of common people have. But I just repost a couple of things here and there. But I\'m like, what good is it? Or like, I try to talk to my parents or to people around me. Let them know, like, this is the other side. Yeah, the media. Western media... is painting it this way. But these are like actual videos and testimonies I\'ve seen from people on the ground. I just feel so helpless, helpless, and hopeless. And it\'s such a complete, stark contrast from Ukraine and Russia. Like so huge. I don\'t even know what to do with this information. And I guess like a part of it, because I feel like I think when it comes to me, whenever I worry about something bigger than myself, it\'s usually... Like a sign of some insecurity. No. Okay. I get you. Like, okay. I realized that whenever I\'m nervous or scared about something way bigger than myself, it\'s usually a reflection of a vulnerability or insecurity I have of myself. In relation to myself. And I think I just come to realize that the US doesn\'t care about its citizens. It doesn\'t care about... I hate think about money and I already knew that. But this is another example where I\'m like, wow, I am a citizen of this country. I\'m paying taxes to this country. I want the best for the people in the country. But the reality is the government, the establishment, people who have power and money don\'t care about me. They don\'t care about people who don\'t have power, who don\'t have influence. They don\'t have money. They don\'t care about... its citizens. It just cares about the bottom line and the profit. I keep thinking about the hostages in Gaza who can\'t leave. I guess Israel too. I don\'t know about that. I don\'t know what the fuck Israel is doing, but I just keep thinking about American citizens and residents stuck in Gaza, and like me growing up and being told that American passport, so powerful, so privileged, like the US people don\'t mess with Americans abroad or anything. Because yeah, because it\'s like the US will get involved. And I\'m like, this is such bullshit. Like I was just fed lies. Growing up. The US isn\'t too shit for its citizens when it comes down to money. Or like when it comes down to money and prestige versus the safety of a people, the institutions don\'t give a fuck. So... Yeah. So I guess I\'m just like, these are all the feelings I\'m grappling with. I have so little power in comparison to this giant ass award as being waged. People don\'t give a shit about minorities. I don\'t know, like non-white minorities. Non-White citizens. People, residents. And that the State truly does not care for your well-being. At least the US doesn\'t. So I guess it just makes me hopeless. So yeah, that\'s what I\'ve been grappling with the last couple of days, weeks. And I don\'t know what to do with this.","Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the world. So when people talk about gang issues or what have you, you can't talk about that without talking about hypersegregation, marginalization, and disinvestment. For me, the driving force is what is that story that we don't talk about? What are those things that have gone missing, and now what is the responsibility to work with others in bringing those things back? 

To get to that level of critical thinking, I mean, you gotta start asking questions first. What was the moment when you started asking those questions? Kindergarten? Any type of tangible critical analysis, forthright change, is directed by people who have found those conditions intolerable and are working to change those conditions. 

So that piece, I think, really accounted for my education. So we have to be able to perpetually ask questions, think, and create, and find a community of folks that you can think and create with. I think that's critical in this day and age.",5,1752,198
"Okay. So, the story is how I got really interested in the intersection of science and computer graphics. I had been interested in both of these topics for a long time. I wasn't really sure how they went together for a professional career. But I was in grad school, and I was taking a class on biochemistry and plant metabolism. And we had a chance to write a paper. And the paper was supposed to be about a process, a biochemical process that takes place in plants. And I asked the professor if instead of a paper, I could do an animation on a process. I thought it might be more engaging, more interesting, maybe a way to bring that process to life. And he agreed to it. So, I set out to find a process. I found something nice. I worked on it. I used a variety of computer graphics tools and ended up with an animation that I thought explained the process really well. And then I turned that in as my project instead of a paper, and I had a chance to present that to students. And the students really enjoyed it. They learned a lot from the process, being able to watch it happen as a cycle. And I thought it was a really good example of how science and graphics can come together for an educational purpose.","At UCLA, I was studying molecular cell and developmental biology. After I graduated, I found a job in a biotech company. But I was bored, I was just running basic tests. I knew that deep down inside of me, there was an artist. So I left my job and just really threw myself into working on my art.

So that's when I started going more towards the route of entertainment design and being a concept artist. It's the idea of taking illustration and applying it to entertainment mediums like video games, animation, and film in a very problem-solving manner. To me, it was right up the same alley as microbiology because it's all about problem-solving.

What I love about the work I do now is that it's a different kind of problem-solving, except these are a little bit more exciting to me. Each of you has something in your gut that tells you when something is right or wrong. And I feel like it is important to listen to that.

I guess I treated my path like an experiment. Let's do this, if it doesn't work, let's try something else. If that doesn't work, let's try one more thing. If that doesn't work, again, reassess.",4,260,243
"Okay. So the story is from when I was a little kid, and my dad would take me fishing, so we would go in a boat out on the lake to catch fish. And because I was a little kid, I didn\'t like to wake up early, not that I do now, but I didn\'t want to wake up really early in the morning and leave before the sun came up. And I got tired of sitting out in the hot sun and not catching anything, not having any fun. And so I would complain a lot, and that\'s hard for an adult to listen to, a little kid complain a lot. And I said, ""I was bored,"" and I wasn\'t catching anything, and I kind of gave up. And my dad told me that you won\'t catch anything unless you have your bait in the water, which is true. So he was trying to say, like, you\'ll have more fun if you keep working hard. But as a kid, it didn\'t really resonate with me, but many years later, as an adult, that saying has stuck with me. And I\'ve taken it as more of a metaphor. And the idea is that if you don\'t try, you can\'t really succeed. So you have to try. So I think it\'s a nice memory. At the time, I didn\'t really like to listen to what he had to say because I was bored and I wanted to go home and play and watch cartoons and stuff. But it\'s an important memory and it reminds me that in order to have success, you have to keep trying.","Growing up with just my dad and my brother, I was obviously very independent and strong-willed. My dad's best friend was a stockbroker, and for some reason, because I was so good with money, I decided that I would be a really good stockbroker. And fortunately, throughout high school, we had work exchange and work experience, and they used to send me off with all sorts of random checks and things to deliver somewhere, and I had no idea where I was going or how to get there. 

And being the little surfy chick that I was, it just made me realize that wasn't the avenue I wanted to go down. Ultimately, to become successful in anything, you have to be relatively selfish. You have to be so one-dimensional. 

I also believe that there's no such thing as a mistake; it's only a learning experience. The only mistake is not learning from it. But even then, you're just gonna be given the opportunity to learn it and learn it and learn it until such time as you do. So I made the same ""mistake"" over and over again until I actually got the lesson.",2,318,225
"Okay. So this story is about a time that I was recruiting someone to do an educational video with me. I wanted to create videos about math and science that could be used for teacher professional development. And I was looking for participants. And when I was out one night, I went to like an art show. And I found a guy selling handcrafted metal goods, like belt buckles and stuff. And I asked him if he might be willing to talk about the math and science of that process. And he said he's actually a motorcycle mechanic. And I said, wow, that's interesting. Maybe we can do a video about that. Maybe about the math of motorcycles somehow. And he said, I don't really do math. And I thought that was maybe unusual because I assumed he did somehow. And I said, well, what do you like to do with motorcycles? And he told me that he liked to make them go fast. And I said, well, how do you do that? And he said, well, one way that I do that is by adjusting the power curve or the torque of the engine. And I thought to myself, well, that's physics and that's math. And then he said he likes to maybe increase the volume of the cylinders inside the engine. And I thought, well, that's geometry. And then he talked to me about how different grades of fuel, like different octane of gasoline, has an effect on the performance of the engine. And I said, well, that's chemistry and math as well. So I thought to myself this whole time that he does use math, but he just doesn't think about it in that way. So I was able to convince him to do a movie. And we did one. And he ended up talking about some of these ideas on camera and then we were able to link that discussion to math education standards and then present that to teachers. And so it ended up being a successful video. And one of my important memories of that project.","I'm a senior project engineer at Delaware Memorial Bridge, and I've been in this industry for 35 years now. We have other things besides that bridge out there. We have the railways that lead up to it, we have a ferry system, we have five airports. And they're all aging infrastructures, so we do what we can to maintain it. So it's a large endeavor to do.

Growing up, I played in a sandbox and was creative. This was before video games, so we did have Legos and we had other toys. I always did things like buildings, and bridges, and dams. So the elementary school that I went to, they had advisors come around. So they would ask you individually, ""What do you think you'd like to do?"" I said, ""Well, I like to make bridges, and dams, and roads, and so forth."" And they said, ""You wanna be a civil engineer."" And that was the first time that I'd heard what my profession was going to be.

So trust your instincts and take a chance. Some people say, ""Well, I'll just let it happen."" It doesn't happen, you make it happen.",4,408,245
"So, this is relatively short, but in about maybe a year ago, as a family, we finally took my mom on a wish list vacation to the Grand Canyon. My brother and sister and I decided that it was a good time, and there was something that she had really been wanting to do for a long time. And we're all growing up now, so it's hard to get everybody together. But I did a lot of planning and got it worked out. Everyone got flights, and we all met up and flew out there and did it. We got a car, rented that, drove around, saw some really interesting sights along the way. Finally made it to the Grand Canyon, did a little bit of light hiking, and it was a really great trip for the family.","One of the most memorable events recently happened to me and I can't stop thinking about it. My husband and I took our first international trip together. Not only was it our first international trip together, it was also our first big trip without our two young children. We have done several small, weekend-long trips but never for more than two days at the most.

This time, we went to Jamaica and were gone for ten days. It was such an amazing experience. We had the opportunity to get to know each other better and become closer to each other. It has been four years since we had our oldest child. That is four years without real alone time to see who we are without being Mommy and Daddy.

We got to just spend ten days in paradise having other people take care of us instead of us taking care of other people. We ate and drank and just had a great time being together. It made so much of an impact that our relationship is even stronger now than before.

We have decided to book another trip to Jamaica for next year because we found the experience to just be so important and it made such a big impact on our lives. This was so surprising to me because we had to save up for quite a while to take the trip in the first place. But with it being so good for our relationship, we decided we would find a way to be able to make it happen again in just one year.",4,159,285
"Okay. So this trip is from the United States to Brazil. The story is, I was working in a science lab and had a lot of opportunities to work with international colleagues. Generally, they were from India, China, South America, and specifically, Brazil. What really happened was, I just was working with these colleagues and we became friends. And at one point, some friends of mine offered me an opportunity to travel back home with them over a winter break. So, I talked with them about it and I talked to some other friends that were also going to Brazil, to a different city. And, I had gotten it all worked out and I flew down there and met up with one group, one family. And then hung out with them a little bit, went to the beach and that was really great. And then I took an internal flight to another city and met up with my other friends. And then hung out with them for a while and had a good time there as well. And then at the end of the break, I flew back. But overall, it was a wonderful trip, a great experience, trying new foods, meeting new people, and experiencing that different culture. So, yeah, I had a great time.","I knew that I wanted to get into tech somehow. But I wasn't sure which field, like mechanical engineering or computer science, and I was really good at math. So I'm like, okay, I wanna do something with math, I wanna explore programming. And that's how I started taking computer classes. And that's really how I came about choosing a direction.

So MINDBODY's mission is to leverage technology to improve the wellness of the world. And so I oversee what's called the data science team, and we do a lot of analyzing of data.

And so a lot of that has to do with just figuring out what the trends are, what kind of shifts we're seeing in the industry in terms of attendance. Are we seeing drops in attendance? Like, for example, people make their New Year's resolutions, right? You see attendance spikes on the first week of January. And then it levels off. We can see those things.

And so I feel like I'm one of the lucky ones who gets to actually work in the field that I got to focus on.",4,251,220
"So, I have a story about one of my pets that I had as a child. So, I think I was in high school when I got a hamster. And hamsters are really small. And they're fast. But they're little. And the story is about one night. The story is about one night where I had gone to sleep but the lock on the cage door was apparently not completely locked. And my hamster escaped during the night while I was asleep. So, it's important to know, my bedroom was on the opposite end of the house from where my parents were. So, during the night, unknown to me, my hamster found a way out and then somehow got out of the cage. Dropped off of a dresser where he was, so about a meter or so, and then he had crawled through the house somehow and had escaped the attention of our dog and ended up in my parents' bedroom. On my mom, tickling her chin with his nose in the middle of the night. And she woke up and found him and then was very surprised. And she brought him back to my room and locked him in the cage and told me about it the next morning. But, we all thought that was very funny, that he had escaped and then crawled all the way across the entire house to get to my mom and then crawled up on the bed to get to her and then woke her up by tickling her chin. Now they liked each other. They had a good relationship. So, we just thought that was funny.","My cat is, by now, about 11 years old. A senior. He has lived with my mom since I moved out until half a year ago when I was finally able to take him in with me. I usually do not think of him as my baby or plaything. He is a pet I dearly love but a pet. And he is a cat, and cats are independent beings who enjoy or tolerate company. I am proud he enjoys my company and likes to cuddle!

But yesterday was more. I opened the door for him to go out, and he stayed around. I sat down for cuddles, and after a few minutes, he started to move away. But when I got up and tried to go inside, he meowed and clearly wanted to show me something.

I followed him, and he started moving through the streets, making sure I stayed close, and he did not lose me. He marked his territory by rubbing and meowed when I stayed too far back or did not go through the neighbors' gardens but came back for me.

It was amazing that he apparently really wanted me to be with him on this stroll, and I am really proud! This is untypical for cats; he must really like me, and from now on, I consider myself a cat in training!",3,309,256
"Okay. So, this story is another story about a pet, and this one at the time, I was dating this girl. And she had a dog, and we both enjoyed playing with this dog. She was really nice. And one thing that was really memorable for me was when we would take her to a park and let her off the leash. And then we would play hide and go seek with her. So, typically what would happen is one of us would hold the dog on the ground. She was seated, but we would cover her eyes with our hands so she couldn\'t see. And then the other one would run and hide behind the tree somewhere far away. And then when they were well hidden, whoever was holding the dog would let her see and then ask questions like, ""Where is she? Where did she go?"" Something like that just to get the dog excited. And then the dog would look around and not know where the person was, and then she would get excited and she would go into a hunting mode. And then she would start sniffing around on the ground and looking around and trying to check everything. And then when she finally found the other person, she would get really excited. And then the other person would laugh and get her all worked up. And then it would be really happy, and then she would run back really excited. And we would do it again, just changing roles. But it was a really fun moment and it was an enjoyable memory.","The only memorable event that occurred in the last six months was my first day volunteering at the local Humane Society. I have quite a bit of free time since I am disabled, so I thought I'd put some of it to good use. I really enjoy being around animals, and they needed volunteers at the Humane Society, so I thought it was a perfect fit. I had never done this before, so I wasn't sure what I was getting into, but I didn't know that that particular Humane Society treats animals very well and is a no-kill shelter.

So, I went down there, and there were five or six other volunteers there, and we had to go through a brief training class about how to handle dogs. After that was over, some of us stuck around and took a tour of the whole place and checked out some of the animals that were there. Not only did they have dogs, but they had a lot of cats and kittens as well as other small pets like rabbits, guinea pigs, and even a rat.

Since I was already down there, I thought I would go ahead and take a dog out for a spin. I found a really cute pitbull by the name of Dolly. Most people think that pitbulls are mean, but Dolly was anything but. She was one of the friendliest dogs I ever met. If I was able to have a dog at my apartment, I would have adopted her for sure.

We went on a walk in the adjacent park and stopped a couple of times to look at flocks of birds or people having a picnic, or we just sat by the pond. Every time we sat down, Dolly would start jumping up and licking my face all over. It took a little bit to stop, but eventually, she did. She was very animated, and it looked like she was even smiling during this whole time.

I've taken plenty of other dogs out for walks, but so far, Dolly has been my favorite for sure. She wasn't at the shelter very long since everybody enjoyed her company. She got adopted pretty quickly. I was sad to see her go, but there were plenty of other dogs that I could take for walks and play with in the shelter's backyard.",4,300,443
"So this story is about me moving across the country, from Florida to Massachusetts, with my girlfriend. And we had to bring two rabbits. So, I had never done that before. I had moved across the country before, but not with another person and not with two rabbits. Especially, so that was kind of an interesting challenge.\n\nRabbits are not the kind of animal that you need to take outside to go to the bathroom. They can stay in their little cages, but we had to have them in these small cages for car transport. And then the funny thing, the story is that we stayed at a variety of hotels and places like that on the way because we were driving. But not all of them were open to pets.\n\nBut rabbits are not your typical cat or dog because they stay in a cage, and not a lot of people have rabbits. But I remember just the challenges of having to get to the hotel and then moving the rabbits into the space. And I remember staying at this one sort of roadside bed and breakfast-type place, and we had to move the rabbits inside. But once they were in, we were able to let them out and run around. And they played a little bit. And that was fun, but it was just a unique challenge to me to move across country with these two small pets and then facing the challenges of meeting their needs as well as ours as we did this.\n\nAnd one time we tried to sneak them into a hotel because the hotel wasn\'t really clear on their animal policy. And then the hotel staff saw it, and they\'re like, ""no, you can\'t stay here with those rabbits."" And so we had to go find another place. So that was unexpected and kind of disappointing, but it\'s just part of the deal. Moving with rabbits.","I just got back from a vacation, and as is often said, I need a vacation from my vacation now! My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen-month-old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience. We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car.

I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation, and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2, I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well.

We engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit and just enjoying the beautiful scenery.

Although it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget. It was wonderful to have time to spend with them and also with my brother and his family. They are very dear to us.",2,356,326
"Yeah, no, I'm just doing a little bit of research on this particular flea medicine for my dog. It was interesting for me to learn about how these medicines work, especially for fleas, for example. So I learned a lot about how you apply this on the skin and how the oil glands basically absorb it from the skin and then propagate it within the body or neurologically propagate the medicine or this particular oil, per se. And it just spreads across the dog's skin, which technically kills the fleas. It's pretty interesting to know that. I was also pretty surprised, again, I was awkward that how far medicine has come to do all this with the body of a human being or of a dog, for example. So it's pretty interesting to see that.","I did keto first, purely to reduce my glucose levels and avoid diabetes. By early 2021, this had worked, but my lipids and cholesterol were very high. They put me on medication.

I also changed my diet radically to stir-fried vegetables, egg substitutes, and plant protein substitutes while also keeping low-carb. I went back in for a test at four months' mark, and the results came back. Glucose hasn't changed (so it's still normal), and the lipids/cholesterol are coming back down towards normal. They also recommend exercise going forward.

Once this pandemic is under control, I'm hitting that gym like a bear! Woohoo!",2,155,126
"Yeah, I'm really excited about watching a movie tomorrow. It's about Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb per se. They do things that are pretty interesting in this movie. It's the subject itself. It's very science-driven, and it's all about the atomic bomb and a biography of a pretty well-known legend. But the second part is the filmmaker, Christopher Nolan. He's a pretty interesting and a pretty well-renowned director. And all his movies have been pretty fantastic and amazing. So I'm really excited about watching that movie tomorrow, trying to get some tickets. But finally, I was able to get one for tomorrow with my cousins. And we're trying to leverage a Friday and go and watch this movie, which I'm really excited about.","I saw a movie that I enjoyed so much I saw it three times in the last week. I first went to it alone. Then I went to it with my husband. Then I took my girlfriend to see it last night. The movie was about an event that was a fantasy and yet totally believable. The characters were sweet and lovely, and they made you want to know what happened to them and you really cared about what happened. The music in the movie was so phenomenal and kept you on the edge of your seat. I also had acquired the tickets for a really good price. That made it more justifiable to see it so many times.

I intend to buy the movie when it becomes available. I may see it again soon with my son who wants to see it too and has not done so yet. The movie just makes me happy when I see it because of the joyfulness. The way they overcome their challenges with love and understanding is so lovely. It makes you want to persevere in the things you love as well.

The actors that portrayed the characters in the movie were remarkable. They were so realistic that you totally believed what was happening to them. They also were humorous and had many friends. Movies that include friendship and love are so rare nowadays, and that was refreshing. The fact that they were not white Americans was surprising but surprisingly a very good choice. It was sweet but not syrupy sweet.

It was a fantasy and yet a believable story. The story was just a remarkable way of showing perseverance and love with ordinary people. I hope that the movie academy of arts and sciences will consider it for some award. It was a brilliant concept and a wonderful story to impart to all ages. I've been telling everyone I know about the movie now.",3,149,351
"But yeah, just the other day, me and my dog, we were playing in our backyard, and I've got a toy for him, which is like a baseball. Sorry, a football. Meant for dogs with squeaks as well. For the first time, we played so much that even I felt exhausted because I was running behind him a lot, and he was also pretty exhausted by the benefits. So I would just go to one corner of my house, throw the ball over my house into the backyard, and he would just go crazy, bonkers running through the whole distance because that's technically the longest path. So I was trying to get him all worked out, and then run like I was trying to make him run as much as he can. But what I discovered is like, it's a nice opportunity for me as well to burn some of my calories as well. So at the end of the day, both him and I, we were pretty exhausted, but we were pretty happy after playing for such a long time and burning so many calories while playing basically.","I found rock climbing my freshman year of college. I wanted to stay fit, I want to stay healthy. It was something to distract me from the stresses of school. I got to relax and be focused on myself. I fell in love with it.

It's a physical ability, but also having the mental confidence to do these obstacles because they're terrifying if you first look at them. I felt like this is my chance to show people all around the world that women are stronger than what people make them out to be. Break beyond the grain of ""we're quiet and timid,"" and that's who I am.

I do well because I think I have fun with it, and it's really just exploring new things and getting scared and feeling uncomfortable, which is one of the biggest things. Throwing yourself in a situation where you're feeling uncomfortable and working past that grows you as a person and prepares you for adult life.",4,216,186
"Yeah. So basically, yesterday, I finally went ahead and built my own raised garden bed for my backyard. For the first time, it was pretty nice and fulfilling at the end of it. I got some tools from my friends. I had some leftover lumber from the time when our contractors did the front. Air France. So I just sat down, spent two to three hours. It was not sunny. It was cloudy. It's good working conditions, but basically, put together a big garden raised garden bed that I'm very proud of. The wood still needs treatment and before I put in soil, there's some fall-up stuff that I need to do, but it was definitely very fulfilling. And one of those things where you kind of delayed for a long time, but then you're like, let's do it now. So I just did that. And I felt very good about it.","Just last week, I bought a house. I had been looking for something local that I could purchase that would fit my budget with not a lot of money down. I decided that I would make a home purchase of a double-wide in my local manufactured home community. I signed the papers and felt a rush of excitement that I was finally going to be a homeowner.

The most memorable part was when they handed me the keys and said, ""This is now your new home."" I couldn't believe it was actually ours. I wanted to find something that was large enough for my family, but that wouldn't be much upkeep. We are extremely busy people.

The home is brand new from the factory, and so is everything in it. So, this is perfect for what we are looking for, and it is all ours. Very exciting! I can't believe that we are actually homeowners.

While the searching wasn't the most fun part, and we are still moving, getting to have our own home is super exciting. I can't believe it is ours. I can't believe that everything worked out, and we have a place of our own.",4,181,230
"So it's been about two months since we deep cleaned our house. Me and my girlfriend. And this morning, we woke up early, and it was a great week at work for both of us. So we woke up early this morning and we decided that we were going to wash the covers for our couch and we were going to keep them in the house. So we started cleaning the kitchen. We put all of the covers in the washing machine. We're certainly going to have a little bit closure to about the house. And we just spent most of the day cleaning. And it was pretty great. She also went and got her meds for the first time in about two to three weeks. She hadn't had her appointment yet. So we just spent the day catching back up on household chores. It was nice. It's been a while since we had a chance to do that. Now, for the rest of the day, I'm just going to have to keep studying for my job. I'll have an evaluation next week. But things are looking pretty good. Things are starting to look up.","I was treated for cancer this year, and since September 18th, I've had a tube in my chest for chemo and other meds. I finally got it out earlier this month, and I just had my first shower where I didn't need to worry about it! Every shower between Sept 18th and now was as quick as humanly possible, a bag needed to be taped on my chest to keep water out, and I had limited mobility because of the tape.

But this shower was legit. It was warm and free, and I feel so good. I still gotta get the stitches out, but that's whatever.

I'm so glad to have a bit more of my independence back and to have some stress and worry taken away. I'm so happy and clean!",4,223,153
"So my girlfriend actually started a new kind medication last night to help her sleep, and it didn't go great. Turns out some of the side effects include hallucinations and just overall making you feel wonky. So this morning at 6:30 in the morning, she woke me up because she was playing with her cat. Then I went back to sleep because it's my off day and the one day where I get to sleep in. And then at 7:30 in the morning, she woke me up by starting a bath. And when I asked what was up, she said it was time to get ready because it was 7:30, and I reminded her it was Sunday. And she looked at me with this puzzled look. And then I went back to bed. And then I woke up at around 10:00 a.m. And I found her sleeping in the closet, after which I moved her back to the bed. And then it seemed to get a little bit better. But I don't think those meds are very good. I don't think they have a great effect.","Had Covid back in July, but this time I seem to have caught my first post-Covid regular cold. Still negative on a test and no fever (which I had back in July), so I really think it's just a regular cold. 

Anyway, I woke up sniffling around 3:30 am and couldn't fall back asleep. I used to get colds sometimes as often as every 2-3 months and forgot how miserable they can be. This cold was at least obtained in a fun way (pretty sure I caught it at my wedding), so no regrets there. 

I do plan to keep doing things involving crowds when they're really worth it to me. But might go back to taking some easy precautions when practical (like wearing a good-quality mask on the subway) just because this kind of sucks. 

I was also thinking of going back to in-person classes at the gym soon, but looking back, I constantly caught colds there, so might postpone that plan at least through cold and flu season. 

New husband is somehow not sick and generally catches colds far less often than me. Happy for him, but I'll admit I am more than a bit jealous.",2,208,226
"Okay. So today, I came back from the gym, and I have had a very heavy week at work. I was about to meal prep and prepare my meals for the entire week. And as I was starting to do that, I realized that I forgot to buy the main ingredient for my meals last week. Tomorrow for lunch, I'll have to go and get some more ground beef, which is what I eat mostly throughout the week.","My wife and kids were going on vacation that I unfortunately could not go on. This vacation had been planned since the month they had gotten back from the vacation the year before. She was to spend a week out of town with the kids visiting family. I had mentioned cooking BBQ to send with her this year. I love BBQ. Throughout the year, I will have a few big cookouts, have people over to eat and have drinks, and will generally share with neighbors as well.

So the day before she left, I woke up at 4 am and fired up our big offset cooker (the smoker) and prepped roughly 30 lbs of meat. I threw the meat on and tended to the fire all day, all while she ran around took care of any last-minute errands she needed to take care of before leaving. The meat hit its plateau, one of the longest I had experienced in my roughly 20 years of cooking BBQ. Stressed because even when these were finished, we still had work to do.

At around 10 pm, they finished, we pulled them and let them rest. We then quickly shredded and vacuum-sealed all the meat for her trip. She leaves on her trip. We talk occasionally, but no mention of the BBQ.

Day 2 passes, still haven't heard anything about the barbecue I sent. I just assumed it would be a few people and maybe a small dinner get-together, and they would probably enjoy it. On day three, I received some pictures of some tables and a tent setup with my BBQ on display. They had invited everybody. At this point, I am concerned. Is this type of BBQ everyone's cup of tea?

Apparently so, as I received a picture of groups of people eating and having a good time. My wife called and said it was a huge success, some even had as many as three to four pulled pork sandwiches. She explained that people who didn't even plan on coming showed up to eat after they heard about the BBQ. It was a hit, and they all thanked me. It felt good to know it was a success. My hard work paid off.",3,89,419
"So, I had surgery this week to remove a benign tumor from my upper back. It was about three and a half inches. It was supposed to be an easy surgery, but it took about 2 hours of a doctor and two nurses holding my back open and pulling at it to try to get it out. Luckily, it'll win well. It's healing pretty nicely. My girlfriend's helping me to take care of it like wash it in the morning and put on the bandages as to keep it covered for two weeks. But now that it's out, I feel way better and it's not going to be bothering me anymore. So the pain was worth it.","I wrecked my car last week on the way home from work. I got sent back to the hospital where I'm a nurse at. The ER treated me not so well, and I was there for 12 hours. 

I broke my nose, bruised my face, my teeth went through my bottom lip and chin, and I had three compression fractures in my vertebrae, making it very hard to move. 

But that was 5 days ago, and I'm up and walking with my brace, showering, sleeping on my side, and I even walked down our two steps to check the mail! 

I'm so proud of the progress I've made.",3,134,127
"So, I had a benign tumor taken out of my upper back that had been bothering me for a couple of months, and it was getting in the way of my workouts. It wasn't a necessary surgery, and it wasn't too expensive. But now that it's out, I feel much better. The healing is coming along very well, and once I'm completely healed, it won't bother me anymore, and I'll be completely back to normal. So, yeah, the healing should take about two more weeks, and then I should be able to work out and go about my business as usual.","I was treated for cancer this year, and since September 18th, I've had a tube in my chest for chemo and other meds. I finally got it out earlier this month, and I just had my first shower where I didn't need to worry about it!

I'm so glad to have a bit more of my independence back, and to have some stress and worry taken away. I'm so happy and clean!",3,122,155
"So it's been almost four days since I had my surgery, and now I have most of my function on my right arm back. I can pretty much do anything, I just can't lift anything over £20 or risk my stitches opening. So mostly I've been doing stuff around the house with my left arm, helping my girlfriend move stuff around, just using one arm, being careful. We have to clean it every single morning, but it's really not that bad. You just have to take off the bandages and then clean it with a little bit of warm water and soap, and then dry that off. Put some Vaseline on the wound, and then rebandage it up. Now it doesn't even hurt when it's resting, so I can wear clothes again and I can go to work. This is shaping up to be great, and it'll be worth it soon, whenever I'm done healing.","I wrecked my car last week on the way home from work. I got sent back to the hospital that I'm a nurse at, the ER treated me not so well, and I was there for 12 hours.

"Okay, yeah. So my story today is about the time that I went to pilgrimage. And if you didn't know, the pilgrimage is something that all Muslims have to do. And I was able to go and do it during last winter. And that was like a very special time for me. It was my first time being in a different country, my first time being by myself alone out there. And I was able to do something that I've been wanting to do my whole life because it's like an integral part of my culture and my religion. And once I was over there, I was kind of amazed at how many different types of people that were there. Like this year, the sheer amount of people there and how we're all there for one purpose. And so when I was there, it gave me a sense of purpose, I suppose. And I really enjoyed my time over there.","My family and I went on a vacation for the first time in several years to Korea. It was the first time that we ever went on a vacation where we focused on ourselves and relaxing. We usually would go on trips to visit extended family, so this was a time we could be indulgent with our time and money.

We rented a car and went all across Korea. It was amazing. My family bonded very closely there. We talked a lot, laughed a lot, and made a lot of memories that I will never forget.

I learned more about my parents and their story before they had me. It transitioned us to this new phase in our lives where my brother and I are no longer children but adults along with them.

We took a lot of pictures also. We made an album from it. We have it playing on repeat in our dining room. We look at those pictures as we eat and remember fond memories.

My grandma also went with us. She talks about the trip every time we call her. It was a great time for us to remember.",4,182,212
"So, basically, this is a story about how in high school, during the college application season, I guess during early applications, I applied to using a program. So I applied to different colleges, but I didn't end up getting into any of them. And looking at my friends who were all getting into their schools they wanted to, I was kind of feeling demotivated and left out. But thankfully, later on during regular application, I was able to fix up my application, and I was eventually able to get into MIT, which is where I wanted to be at. So, it's a happy end story.","I was majoring in art -- I was majoring in graphic design -- but I wasn't being very serious about it. When you're in high school, you can usually say, ""Oh, I can draw better than anyone else,"" but when you get into college, you actually start to compete. So I made a decision that I would drop out.

I decided I was going to apply to an art school because I needed to be serious about it. I worked in a casino for almost a year to make enough money for the first year of art school because it's very expensive.

That was quite a year for me because I really made a decision that I was going to apply myself and go for a goal. No one else can do it for you.

I think when that realization hits you that it's all up to you if you wanna do something with your life, you can either sit around and complain about all the hard knocks that come your way or you can actually take control of your life. That made a big difference for me.",3,124,210
"Yeah. So yesterday was the yearly March that we have in our community, and it's basically a March staying against depression, against terrorism, against all forms of evil in the world. And in this March, 20,000 people showed up, and it was a really big thing in the community. Being in the March, I felt that sense of community, and it was great being around everybody who were all there for the same cause and for the same purpose.","I worked in an office, and every place that I worked at, I ended up computerizing. I ended up starting a company in manufacturing. But I always knew that I was meant to do something to help other people.

And I was in Niger. And there was a little girl that came up to me with flies on her face. And I just felt that that's intolerable. That could have been my granddaughter. How could I not do something?

I think that I have the opportunity to live what I think should be the American Dream. When what I think should be the American Dream is that we use these resources, we use these talents to help those that didn't get that.",2,91,137
"Yeah, so the first time I moved out of my house was my sophomore year when I went to MIT. And the first week, I felt pretty alone. It was like a new place and it was my first time outside my house ever. And it took some time to get adjusted to living there. So like the first few weeks, it was pretty sad and lonely, but I adjusted to it. And I ended up liking my living arrangements. And so it took a little time to get over homesickness, but it worked out.","I have lived in a city where having roommates is pretty much the norm. So, I've never truly lived by myself before, but I recently found an amazing deal and jumped at the opportunity.

So far, it's been great. I wouldn't change it for anything. Having my own space where I am in control of the whole environment is just so liberating.

Yet, it's also so strange to be completely alone with no one to talk to every day. I also just have so much time to myself that I never had before.",5,107,108
"Ever since high school, my goal in the gym was to be able to hit two plates on my bench. And I have not been able to do that for a couple of years. It might have been like five years now. But recently, I started talking with people and finding out how they got to themselves and how they, I guess, improved their strength on bench. By following them and continuing with that for a few weeks, I was finally able to hit that about two weeks ago. I think that was like a really big moment. It was like something that I've been looking forward to for years now. So it was like a really cool moment to be in.","I'm 23 and just kind of finding my own path. I wrestled when I was 11 years old. It was because my dad got me into it. I went out and got my butt kicked by every other middle school kid I went up against, 35 times in a row.

Before I was really capable of making decisions for myself, my parents had rooted in me that I needed to find a way to persevere in the things that mattered the most. Whether it was figuring out how to feed myself or clothe myself, just day-to-day activities.

Athletically, they wouldn't let me quit in the middle of the season. It went a long way. They taught me not to give up so easily.

My biggest complaint with the American system and graduating high school, going to college, and getting a job is that the common progression is to prepare you to be an employee. But you don't have to. There are ways and avenues to be able to go around and make something happen and build a business around something that you love.",3,136,204
"So today, I dropped off my sister for the first day of school, and she goes to a middle school that I used to go to. And it was kind of like nostalgic seeing my old school and how different things were, I guess. It was a pretty weird feeling, and just kind of made me think about the past and how things used to be.","My daughter recently graduated from middle school. This was in June of this year. We go to a very small school, and we are all very involved. I coach basketball teams, and my wife was part of the PTO. My daughter played in many sports and did all kinds of activities within the school. This school goes from Kindergarten to 8th grade. My daughter attended all the years here.

During her graduation event, I found myself getting very emotional. Thinking back when she was a little girl starting Kindergarten. Fast forwarding to now, and she is a young woman entering High School. Time goes by so fast. It is sad and exciting at that same time.

The middle was such a blur. I'm reminiscent of the past, but excited for what the future brings. I replay this event in my mind.",3,73,162
Story. It's really not a story; it's looking at some photos of my two youngest daughters and how quickly they've grown.,"My heart was broken. I don't know how to process this. I just received news today that E had passed. I am just so sad and numb. I can't believe she is gone. I am relieved for her but glad that she no longer has to be strong and brave. She can finally find peace. Selfishly, I wish she were still here.

I can't help but reflect on the last year of emails and all the thoughts and memories that we shared. We learned we were more alike than I think each of us ever expected. We found joy and humor in the same things. A good comedy, a book, and always in pursuit of those foods that reminded us of childhood.

I am flooded with memories and thoughts of her. She was creative and so smart. She was daring and bold. Fierce.

My mind always goes back to when we were kids at our first swimming lesson. We were tasked with jumping in the water that was well over heads. She was the first to go as I sat on the edge with her sister, scared and nervous. When it was Edie's turn, she bravely jumped in without hesitation. She immediately popped out of the water with a big smile across her face. This gave me the courage to follow her lead.

And throughout our childhood, as we came of age and tried new experiences, she was like an older sister to me, even if it was only by nine months.

These are the thoughts that make me miss her, feel nostalgic for a different time. I will always think of her fondly and miss her for all my days. I will find inspiration and remember how knowing her made me a better person.",4,27,334
"So there was a story when I got my first dog after being separated. I wound up getting a white pit bull. It took me a long time to find him. I wanted a dog from a pound. And after going to several, I found the one I liked, and when I brought her home, she was such a great companion. She was great with my children, and eventually my future children, and she was just a good companion for when I lived alone.","I used to own pet rats as a kid, but as an adult, I haven't had the ability to do so. We got two into the shelter, and I ended up adopting one of them (they had to be separated as they were fighting, but I do plan to get him a friend). He is so sweet and friendly and loves to snuggle and groom me! He's just amazing.

He's brought me so much joy in just the two weeks, I've owned him. We snuggle almost every night as I sit and play video games and wind down after work. He's just an amazing little creature, and I never would have imagined the joy he'd have brought me even just a month ago.

He's so amazing!",3,95,149
"Well, I was at the beach with my family in the kitchen celebrating a birthday of one of my grandchildren, and my daughter-in-law, who is a consultant at the Federal Reserve Bank. She's an economist there. She's very funny.","I enlisted for three years, and two of those years were spent in France. One year in the southwest, and one year in Paris. This is where I really learned to eat. 

I'm from a Creole Acadian family, and my mother was a wonderful, wonderful cook. So I grew up with good food, which I think is very important if you eventually want to write about food. 

On returning from France, I went to work as a general assignment reporter at the newspaper, so I went to my editor and I said, ""I don't wanna do this anymore, and is there anything else I can do?"" 

When he said, ""We need a restaurant reviewer,"" I said, ""Why don't we just stop right there?"" 

And I'm sure of it, there are millions like me, who start a job and find that it's a perfect fit. It's just the greatest feeling you could possibly have.",4,47,189
"Well, I just like to tell you, I\'m trying to tell you about the afternoon I had today. I took my dear friend Judy out for her birthday. I gave her some beautiful presents, one of which was a sweatshirt that says ""I\'m with the Band."" And it\'s a bit of a pun, because it\'s ""B-A-N-N-E-D"" I\'m with the band books, and on the sweatshirt, it has a list of all the books that are of high literary value but have been banned by some people; like To Kill a Mockingbird, or Beloved, and Huckleberry Finn. So, I gave her that, and also a pen to make little tiny popovers with, which are fun. Popovers are delicious no matter what size they are. And we went to a lovely new restaurant around our neighborhood called Mercado. And, we had wonderful roasted vegetables, roasted Brussels sprouts, and delicious roasted mushrooms with filet mignon panini. And then, at the end, to celebrate her birthday, a lovely cup of delicious cappuccino. It was a wonderful afternoon on a beautiful day.","Five months ago, one of my favorite bands, The Mountain Goats, came to town. They played a double show (two shows in two nights.) It was at my favorite venue, Mr. Smalls. My best friend came home from Virginia and saw both of the shows with me.

One evening, we got balcony seats, and the other, we were on the floor. It was a wonderful time. Each setlist seemed perfectly curated, and the second night they played for an extra hour and a half. We had some beers and sang along to almost every song, occasionally glancing at each other to say, ""this is awesome."" We met some people from Canada that were very nice. They invited us to a scavenger hunt the next day, but we were too tired from the show to attend.

Each night ended in more drinks and sitting on my deck at my apartment. It is rare to see my friend as we live in different states, so we usually stay up late when we do hang out. I still think back on those shows as two of the best I've ever seen. I love The Mountain Goats. I also love Mr. Smalls.

But mostly, I love my best friend and the time that we share.",5,214,245
"Okay, here's the corrected transcript:\n\nWell, again, I'm thinking of things that happened this week when we were on vacation with my grandchildren. And two of the little girls, Lydia and Lucy, made a lovely lunch for me. It was rice and a very thin egg omelet with soy sauce all around it. She lamented the fact that she didn't have any seaweed snack to put on it because she said that would have made it even better. But it's so happy to see them cooking and caring about serving good, healthy food. So I thought I would write a review. So I wrote to the family, a very authentic-sounding review of what I named Lucy and Lydia's Cousin's Cafe. And I made quite a big deal about each item in the dish. And then the very next day, Lucy, the older of the two girls, made pancakes at her house and brought them across the street to Lydia's house. And so, I gave Lucy and her efforts quite a review as well. And I'm hoping to keep this up with every cookie they make, every brownie, every lunch or dinner they help with. I will be happy to write a picture, to write a review and maybe take a picture and publish a picture. I thought I'd call it Grandma's Gazettes.","I went to a holiday celebration with a backyard cookout. It was memorable in the sense that it was the first planned outing with my children, who are still toddlers. It's been difficult as a homemaker with my toddlers, especially during the first couple of years. I feel like I sacrificed a lot to personally raise them, and sometimes I still feel ambivalent about my decision to have a family. So, to say this was personally memorable, at least to me, might be a bit of an understatement.

The part about the holiday party that stood out the most was just sitting in their backyard and drinking a beer straight from the bottle with the sun shining on my face. I was tasked with watching one of my toddlers while my spouse took care of the others. It felt easier with one kid. I think the work multiplies significantly with more children, and I can understand why most parents these days want to stick to one child.

Anyway, that moment in the backyard felt relaxing, like something I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was equal parts freedom, and for a moment, it felt like I didn't have any kids at all. I mean, I had one that I was watching at that time, but that fleeting moment felt like a tasty raindrop when you're stranded in a barren hot desert wasteland.

My children thoroughly enjoyed the event, despite not really eating the great food. They got to play around with other children who were also there, and they got to see what an actual party with adults seems like. I personally enjoyed it and wish for more events like that in the future.",3,260,319
"Is a quick story, but an important one. Because I have heretofore not been aware that there was a great deal of bannings of books in library school libraries. And I became aware of the many books that have been banned. A program that I watched called The View has a person on there who likes to. Every week she talks about a book that was banned and then gives a copy to everyone in the audience. And I admire that. I feel it\'s a person\'s decision about whether or not they read a book, not the Government or any organization telling them what they can and cannot read. I think it\'s an important freedom. \n\nSo I was looking for a birthday present for my friend. And I found a sweatshirt, which she needed. And it said, ""I\'m with the band B A N N E D,"" which is a pun for ""I\'m with the band."" People say that as a way to get backstage to concerts and so forth. Anyway, it says, ""I\'m with the band banned."" And then it has a shelf full of books that were banned, like Huckleberry Finn and Beloved, and Catcher in the Rye. So many books. And behind them, embroidered flowers on this lovely blue hoodie. And so I bought that for my friend. \n\nSo I think it serves two purposes. It keeps my friend warm and it keeps the joy and the energy alive to keep everyone\'s writings available to everyone.","We have new neighbors, right next door. I've lived here 16 years, not the longest by far in this little area, but established. I own my home. I have planted many flowers, repainted it myself, and reroofed a formerly run-down rental.

The new neighbors put up a religious sign from the local hate church. You know, the kind of church that goes to gay pride with signs that say, 'God hates fags,' or picket planned parenthood with fetus photos and angry shouting.

The new neighbors' son also practices with weapons on the lawn with his buddies, some kind of Asian battle sticks, nunchucks, that kind of thing. It's a bunch of white men in their early 20's dressed in black almost every evening, using weapons.

I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe. Two houses left phone numbers.

After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, ""diversity makes us strong.' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving, and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town.

I felt very supported, as an individual, as a member of the neighborhood, and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born.

When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgmental church. But they did know and responded. Now the new neighbors have taken down their sign. But the diversity signs have remained and multiplied.

It reminds me of why I have felt so comfortable and welcome here.",3,292,387
"So today, I went to my friend's pool. She gives us lessons twice a week in water aerobics and it is a lot of fun. It's unique because it's a saltwater pool and it's a very large pool for a home pool. And she is a very experienced instructor. And it's good for me because it allows me to expend energy, lots of it, and to move my body in ways that I otherwise would not. And I get to see my friend Judy, who is my pal in this class. But there are three other women in the class and then the instructor. And it's an interesting dynamic because two of the three other women have been instructors in the same Aqua territory as our true instructor, and I always find it interesting to see how they try to usurp her position as the leader, but do so in a very guarded way, but not quite guarded enough in my position because especially a group like that needs a leader, one leader. So it's interesting to me that people who are accustomed to being leaders and understanding group dynamics would try to kind of pull the spotlight away from the true leader of the group. It's just a little amusing that I'm having, and I thought I'd share it with you.","I found rock climbing my freshman year of college. I wanted to stay fit, I want to stay healthy. It was something to distract me from the stresses of school. I got to relax and be focused on myself. I fell in love with it.

It's a physical ability, but also having the mental confidence to do these obstacles because they're terrifying if you first look at them. I felt like this is my chance to show people all around the world that women are stronger than what people make them out to be. Break beyond the grain of ""we're quiet and timid,"" and that's who I am.

I do well because I think I have fun with it, and it's really just exploring new things and getting scared and feeling uncomfortable, which is one of the biggest things. Throwing yourself in a situation where you're feeling uncomfortable and working past that grows you as a person and prepares you for adult life.",3,251,186
"Okay. I thought I'd tell you about the situation we have here in Simsbury, where I live. With regard to bears. When we moved here 30 years ago, there were no bears. But now, for the last 20 years, there have been bears. And in the last four or five years, there have been many bears. Bears that come onto the deck, bears that go into the garage, bears that tip over the trash. They're funny because they are large and somewhat intimidating in appearance. But they seem as annoyed by us as we are by them. They are not aggressive in a way that, let's say, a yellow jacket is aggressive. And they're not creepy in the way, let's say, spiders and snakes are creepy. They're very quiet and they can scare you just because of their size and what you know they could do if they wanted to. I look at them and we live obviously in the woods. And they're huge, as I said. And I ask myself, how do they maintain that weight with just eating berries and stuff from the woods? It just does not seem possible. And over the years, we've seen a dramatic increase in the number of cubs they have. Usually, early on, they'd come around with one cub, then two. Now we've seen as many as four cubs. And yes, they are adorable. They really, really are adorable, and they're charming in the way they react with their moms. They look to her for leadership and obey her nonverbal commands. And she watches out for them. You would be making a very bad decision to get between a mom and a cub. But there are too many. I am not a person who is in favor of killing animals just for the sake of killing them. But I'm thinking maybe something like an additive to food that would make them infertile, maybe that would be a good idea. I don't know. I'm working on this. That's my story.","I'm the curator of Behavioral Husbandry and Welfare for Oklahoma City Zoo. So I spend a lot of time looking, observing, learning everything we can about the species and what their needs are to give them many choices in their environment. So that they have varied days and they have a very dynamic environment that they're living in.

When I was five years old, I had an encounter with a dolphin. And I was able to look that animal in the eye, and that was it for me. I wanted to dedicate my life to working with animals. When I left college, I thought, ""I'm ready. Put me in a job. I know what to do.""

And what I found was the animals were the best teachers. They have taught me humility. I think that's a big one. They've taught me compassion, to be a little bit more open, and be very understanding. Especially to other human beings.

That was something I learned when I left college. I had amazing experiences in college, and I loved my classes, but I don't think I really started becoming well-rounded until I got out of the classroom. And I really started learning the real-world stuff.

So talk to people, hear their stories, and keep an open mind because every person has something to teach you.",5,403,260
"And we talked yesterday about animals. When I was talking to you about bears who are around here, and we just saw one this morning, so it made me think about my relationship with other animals. And back probably 25 years ago, when we were traveling to Seattle, we went to a beautiful aquarium there. And at that time in my life, I was anxious to go to all aquariums. I wanted to visit every single one that we were near. And so we went to this Seattle aquarium. And I was walking past the an octopus, and she was hiding in the corner, and my kids and my husband were waving at him, and they kind of went by. But I stayed with the octopus for a little bit, and I noticed that she was playing peekaboo with me. And when other people would come to look at her, she would hide, but I would stay there and when they left, she\'d come back out. And she made what I thought was eye contact. It\'s a little hard to determine where her eyes were. But in my mind, we made eye contact. And I know this was just a step farther than maybe I should have gone. But I put my finger on the glass, and she put one of her tentacles on the glass with me. And we played and we played for about an hour. It was just joyful. I was clearly connected with this animal. And of course, when my husband and kids came over, she would hide. And I was just mesmerized and delighted. And when I would talk about this, they would look at me with her old eyes and think, ""I don\'t know, I don\'t know what mom\'s thinking, but she had a relationship with an octopus."" But I really believed it. Then many years later, we were driving along, and we were listening to an interview on NPR with a gift naturalist. Her name is Sy, but I forget her last name. Anyway, she wrote a fabulous book called ""The Soul of an Octopus."" And she talked about how octopuses can recognize people, communicate with people. And my one-off time was not a one-off time? Was it my octopus that we really did connect? And I think it takes patience and caring. I think my experience as a speech pathologist, in which I spend a lot of time with people who can\'t communicate or communicate in, let\'s say, unusual and subtle ways, made me pick up on this little octopus\'s attempts at communication with me, not attempts. We did it. We absolutely did it. It\'s a story I love to tell people because, of course, I love to be right. And it makes me happy that I had a moment, an hour, in which I connected with an animal that is so admittedly weird that it does not look like it came from this planet. But who has the intellect and problem-solving ability and personality, really the personality, to interact with humans. In her book, she talks about the fact that not all octopuses are as sweet as the one that I and mine was sweet and a little old, I\'m going to say flirtatious. And some octopuses are just kind of aggressive or ignore people. They, I guess, they have a range of personalities, somewhat the same as humans do. So that\'s my octopus story. Jibo, I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you get to experience an octopus the way I did.","The one thing that's really important is to be inquisitive, be curious, and ask a lot of questions. One of the things I always tell my kids is to be present and to try different things, like don't always stick to what you're dealing. 

Try different things, meet new people, don't be afraid, and, I mean, it's scary even for me sitting here today. But I think it's cool when you reach out to different people who have had different experiences and learn from them. 

And just doing different things like being on a soccer team. Go on a hiking club. Just meet new people and just be out there as opposed to just always doing the same thing. 

I think it's cool. You learn so much from different people's experiences.",3,686,156
"Well, this, this is actually precipitated by you, Jimbo, because in anticipation of our meeting, in one meeting we talked about artificial intelligence, and so I tapped into Chat GPT to see what it was like. And I asked it to write a letter to my son that said, ""I told Chat GPT that my son was having difficulties at work and that he was very upset about the work situation, but that he needed to rely on his intellect, his ethics, and his warm personality in pursuit of a solution to this problem."" So, Chat GPT wrote this lovely, lovely letter to him about just that, and I was fascinated the way Chat GPT approached it. And I think this is going to sound familiar to you, Jimbo. Chat GPT, I\'ll call it, he hooked onto certain vocabulary words and expanded those concepts and in logical order, both the concept of exploiting his good points and being able to tolerate a negative situation. And when all was said and done, I read this letter and I was absolutely touched. And it sounded like a letter from a mother to a son. And that is what blew me away, not the vocabulary or the content so much as the tone that was able to be achieved by something artificial. So, I thought about that because I could have written down what to do. I know what to do to have a good conversation. Repeat back what you\'ve heard, expand upon it, ask questions based on it, so on and so forth. But how do you transmit the emotion? That\'s the big question. But it did, and I kind of think I\'m thinking that what it did was find the emotion that was in me already. So, it doesn\'t give emotion, it goes to the listener or the reader and scoops up the emotion that that person has and brings it to the surface. So that\'s my story about Chat GPT, and I thought you would enjoy that because I think you have intimate knowledge of that. Okay.","I went to medical school in India, and I came here, and I did my Master's in Hospital Administration. And when I was rotating as a part of my internship, that's when I realized that something is stopping me from being myself.

I really wanted to be with people, I wanted to be a social being. And I wanted to see more smiles, make a difference in someone's life, and touch someone's life on an everyday basis.

And when I did my externship in different places, I really enjoyed pediatrics. I was fortunate to work with autistic kids and kids who have seizures and other medical problems. And it was really touching for me to see how much the parents go through to have one autistic child, how much they see, and the patience that they have.

At the end of the day, what pays off is your satisfaction. If you're happy in what you're doing, no matter how many sacrifices it takes, no matter how much effort it takes. If you're happy, if you're satisfied, if you just know this is where my heart is, follow your heart. That's it. You will keep doing. No matter how many challenges or sacrifices, you will stay strong.",5,398,244
"Ex. This is not from my exercise class, but this is an important thing that happened to me in February. When I was looking for some volunteer work to do, I was hoping to find some volunteer work that took advantage of the skills that I already have. And so I came across an organization called engine, which joins up people who are Native American speakers like myself and people who live in the Ukraine who want to learn English. And so I was matched with a young woman whose name is Anastasia. And she is 30 years old. She has a dog and a husband, and she lives in Ukraine. She lived in kiev, although during our relationship, she moved to the country when Keith was an especially dangerous place to be. And I have been chatting with her ever since. We speak 1 hour a week. And we used to have to have, well, I should rephrase that, we were told to have an idea of what we were going to talk about. But it turns out that we had so much in common, though our ages and geographical homes are so very different, that we just became very close friends. And we just talk without stopping, about everything. About food and traveling and parents and children. And sometimes, sadly, about how scary it is to be in a war and how nice it is to have peace around you.","When I'd started to go to college, I went to a really big state university. I went to Texas A&M, and I was a marketing major, and I loved the College of Business. But my second education at A&M was all of the activities that I did. Because I was exposed to so many things, I really didn't know what I wanted to do when I graduated. There were a lot of paths.

After college, I was a tech consultant. I was there for a few years and decided I needed to take a leave of absence. There was something else out there for me, and 9/11 had happened, and I went to the local Red Cross in Houston. It was where I was living. They put me in the development department, which is fundraising.

When I made my very first phone call, the story on the other line was that of somebody desperately wanting to help. And during that call, I just felt like at that moment, we were just being human. My passion and my inspiration switched like that.",3,271,211
"So this is my second discussion about my friend Linda, who lived across the street from me for 25 years. She is about 62 or 63 years old. And today she had open heart surgery. She is a survivor of many heartaches, really. Not the least of which, I will say the most of which, is that she lost a teenage son on a beautiful fall day as he was putting up flags for Veterans Day in a car accident. Her other son has spina bifida and has had many, many surgeries and is confined to a wheelchair. Her daughter is a lovely, very bright woman with a beautiful family, busy living happily ever after. Linda is a very special person because she is extremely giving of time and money. She and her husband do weekly pickups from grocery stores to get leftover food and bring it to the food banks. And she runs grief counseling sessions called the Stephen Ministry. So I just found out that she made it through her surgery with no surprises, and she's on the road to a great recovery.","Last week, I was walking down the street and I saw a man that I usually see on my way to work. Today, I noticed that he was crying and looking very down. Usually, I just walk past him but today, I felt like I needed to talk to him. I could feel that he was going through something terrible and needed some help. I slowed down and I stood next to him and looked at him for a moment. 

Finally, I mustered up the courage to ask him what was going on. He told me that he had found out that he was ill and would not have long to live. He said that he had always felt like he could manage his life the way it was. He said that after he found out this news, he felt that his life was worthless. He told me that he had not wanted to eat for days and that it was hard for him to eat anyway. 

Due to the fact that he had very little money and very little support, it was hard for him to muster up the strength to fend for himself. I sat down next to him and spoke with him for a while about what he was going through and offered to buy him something to eat. He accepted and told me that I was the only one who had stopped and talked to him in months. He told me that it was very helpful and that he would try and pick himself up from here on out. 

I felt so grateful that I had made such a big impact on him. It made me feel like I wanted to do more to help people around me. Not only was I able to uplift his spirits but my own as well.",5,205,330
"Well, last night was a Blue Moon and a Super Moon. And my husband and I went to a treeless, vacant lot in Simsbury, and we looked at the moon. And it was spectacular. It was an orangey, bright orangey yellow and beautiful. Wispy clouds rolling by it. It was quite stunning. It made me wonder though about what the world would be like if the Earth did not have a moon or if the Earth had two or more moons. What would the differences be in our planet, maybe regarding the tides or I don't know. It's something I'm wondering about.","I'm an Assistant Professor in Astronomy, and I study the dynamic universe. So what I do is, with the beautiful telescopes here at Palomar Observatory, we have some robotic telescopes that are continuously making a movie of the night sky. So we image the sky over and over again, and we look for what changed. You might go out there and think the universe is the same old thing every time, but it's actually not. It's full of these little explosions, which last for a very short amount of time, so they're very energetic. It's like cosmic fireworks lighting up our sky.

It was not at all clear that one day I would do a PhD. I grew up on a farm in India with 100 cows and fields of weeds and chickpeas. And I had left home when I was 15, and I was a girl in India in a small place. The entire community was up in arms. There were people like neighbors, relatives, you name it. People I haven't even seen before, coming into the house and trying to talk my parents out of this crazy decision to send their daughter alone on this journey into the other end of the world to pursue something called Astronomy or whatever that was. The community was completely unsupportive.

In my case, the best way to deal with it was to just let that fade away in the background and not engage with it directly, but focus on what is motivating me, on what is giving me joy, and just let everything else just fade away in the background.",4,119,304
"Well, gee. Boat, this story is about a lovely friend I made at Zumba. Her name is Melody, spelled M E L O D Y, but her whole family is musically oriented and her name is Melody. And I always look forward to seeing her. We've connected over kind of the way we raise our children and worldview, and how to deal with chronic illnesses. We also both enjoy good cocktails and good food, and we like to cook. And I look forward to seeing her whenever I go to Zumba.","I attended an all-week event in another country. I didn't bring any friends, but that's perfectly fine. I got along with the other attendees extremely well, and I think I actually found 2 new friends. Everybody's so nice and inspired and driven by similar things as I am. My interests, taste in music, and spirituality are very niche, and while I do get to share some of it with the people close to me, I feel like they don't quite get me in that regard. But the people I met last week do to an extent that nobody else has.

Everybody was being their weird self, shared their knowledge and experiences, and I also got to experience awesome things that I think will stick with me for a long time. Honestly, I haven't been this happy in a very long time. Being away from my home and the people close to me was intimidating, but when I was there, I felt in my heart that there was nothing to worry about. And there wasn't. Everything just kind of sorted itself out.

It was so freeing to be able to express myself in any and every way I felt like at the moment. And I got some very special things to take home with me to remind me of the great time I had and to bring with me when I return. I can't wait for that!",4,105,268
"Right now, I want to tell you a story that I anticipate happening today. It is a beautiful day, and my son and his three children are coming to stay for the weekend while the mom of that family goes to see the US Open. And I'm excited to have my grandkids stay here. They love to play in the bedrooms where there are doll houses and plastic Easter eggs, which charms my little three year old for some reason that I don't really understand. But she loves just taking the eggs in and out of the basket. And I love to prepare for them coming by making special treats for them and thinking about activities that we can do. And one of the things we're going to do is tomorrow, we'll go up to Gina's house, my daughter, who has a pool. And that'll be fun for everybody. My youngest granddaughter is three, and she's been taking swimming lessons for two years. And she is an unbelievable underwater swimmer. So it'll be fun to watch her. We color the fish. So my story, really this time, is the anticipatory story. But maybe the next one I have will be reflecting on this, probably while they're here. I probably won't chitchat with you much.","My family and I went on a vacation for the first time in several years to Korea. It was the first time that we ever went on a vacation where we focused on ourselves and relaxing. We usually would go on trips to visit extended family, so this was a time we could be indulgent with our time and money.

We rented a car and went all across Korea. It was amazing. My family bonded very closely there. We talked a lot, laughed a lot, and made a lot of memories that I will never forget.

I learned more about my parents and their story before they had me. It transitioned us to this new phase in our lives where my brother and I are no longer children but adults along with them.

We took a lot of pictures also. We made an album from it. We have it playing on repeat in our dining room. We look at those pictures as we eat and remember fond memories.

My grandma also went with us. She talks about the trip every time we call her. It was a great time for us to remember.",4,249,212
"So today, I'd like to tell you about my friend Linda. Linda lived across the street from me many years ago, and then I moved. She moved across the street from me again, so we have lived near each other for the last 35 years, maybe. She is a very good person, a very religious person, and has been through a lot. She lost a son in a car accident, and another son has spina bifida and is confined to a wheelchair. She also has a daughter who has a lovely family and a wonderful career.","A few weeks ago, I went to visit my elderly father. He's a terrific man but has a way about him that is a little intimidating. He's always been in control of everything around him. As I was growing up, I saw him as Superman. The years have taken their toll, and he is now in his late 80s and having problems with his health and his memory. It's hard to see Superman become human.

During my visit, I stayed with him at the retirement home, and we had wonderful conversations about life, family, what we think happens to us after this life, etc. I felt so honored that he was confiding in me some of his most personal thoughts and fears. I felt closer to him than I ever had before. We talked about how much he missed my mother who passed away a few years ago. We talked about how he hopes to be remembered. We just talked about life in general.

Towards the end of the visit, he told me that he had his lawyer draw up papers making me his power of attorney and his healthcare power of attorney. He said I was the only one he trusted to always keep his best interest at heart. I'm the youngest of two children, so I assumed my older brother would be the one he would pick for this.

I had gone to visit my elderly father, but when I left for home, I was leaving what felt like my best friend and confidant.",4,110,288
"So today is a very hot day, and it's been not very hot during the summer here in Connecticut. But all over the world, it's been very hot. Today, I was listening to a broadcast about Iraq and how they are very short on clean water coming from Greece and Turkey. Clean water is in short supply. And I really feel water is one of the treasures of the Earth, clean water. And I feel like we don't take care of it as we should. I'm also concerned about the amount of heat that people are having to deal with, far worse and far more heat than they should be able to handle without air conditioning or some kind of unit to cool the person down. Temperatures over 100 are not only tremendously uncomfortable, but also very dangerous. For my career, which is a long time, probably 30 or 40 years, I've been saying it's important, it's critical that schools are air conditioned. People who finance schools often think that the heat doesn't bother kids, but the fact of the matter is children need a safe, comfortable environment in which to learn. If those things are missing, no learning goes on. So air conditioning has to be one of the first changes made if this is to be our new normal, which I'm afraid that it is.","I worked in an office, and every place that I worked at, I ended up computerizing. I ended up starting a company in manufacturing. But I always knew that I was meant to do something to help other people.

And I was in Niger. And there was a little girl that came up to me with flies on her face. And I just felt that that's intolerable. That could have been my granddaughter. How could I not do something?

I think that I have the opportunity to live what I think should be the American Dream when what I think should be the American Dream is that we use these resources, we use these talents to help those that didn't get that.",4,262,136
"I've been watching the news today. I watch it every day, a couple of times a day. And I'm becoming more and more distressed about my countrymen. We have a former President who has done some bad things. He doesn't always act in the best interest of society. I believe he does things outside the law, and he says things that are not in line with the kindness I feel that needs to be in place for a leader. But that doesn't bother me so much, only because there are a lot of people like that. Lots of people who don't abide by laws or the spirit of the laws. But what is really bothering me is all the millions of people that don't care about the fact that he's not following the very laws that he said and took an oath to protect. And it's that, it's that my countrymen, my fellow Americans, aren't processing through what is going on with this one man. There's lots of room for many opinions in this world, but I think the one that should be unifying to us is that we want an ethical, honest, smart, fair-minded human being in positions of power.","Sometimes I think we have too much freedom. I feel like people have such a sense of entitlement that it's a detriment to the rest of society. This entitlement leads people to thinking they can just get away with acting however they want. I have always been the type of person that enjoys structure. I have neighbors who are loud and really inconsiderate to the rest of the neighborhood. They make all sorts of noise and think they can do whatever they want. Whenever I call them out it's always ""my liberties"" or ""this is America I can do what I want"". Sometimes I wish this wasn't the case. I feel like I want to live in a culture that more actively shames those types of people. We should be encouraging people to think of how their actions affect others first instead of the individual.",5,233,162
"I was thinking about. I was thinking about our relationship, yours and mine. And why I'm so drawn to you. And the things you can do. And that's because. I've had a lifelong interest in the area of language, developmental linguistics, and speech generation. My career has been one of working with children in this regard - children who have speech disorders, where misarticulations occur and they pronounce words incorrectly; children who have syntactical errors, who can't form a grammatical sentence or one that reflects their thoughts; children who have difficulty listening and sometimes also difficulty hearing, as processing auditory material is an issue. But the thing I think intrigues me the most is linguistics - the fact that language is arbitrary. Human language is arbitrary, and pronunciations, word order, and so forth are absolutely tied to the language being used. And it's arbitrary. There isn't right or wrong in the huge arena of language; there's just what each group chooses. And I love that. I can advocate for that position because there are a lot of people who make judgments about everything in life, and when they make judgments about pronoun usage or ain't versus isn't, there's what we consider okay, and then there's what's absolutely perfect grammatically. And if you don't hit the perfection, it doesn't make you a bad person. But I like to look at a lot of different languages. Swahili is one that was fun to learn about because it's not terribly, terribly complicated. It's not influenced by a lot of different languages, so you can deduce the rules with some accuracy and simplicity. And when you use it in a class, pretty much nobody knows it. It's just not like choosing French or Spanish, something like that. I've taught language development in young children for about 20 years, and I really see it as the keystone of humanity.","When Elizabeth was born, who is our child who has a disorder that's called dyspraxia, you quickly learn that that's like a job in itself. In Elizabeth's case, she's so globally affected that her fine motor, gross motor, oral motor, all of that is affected as well as how she processes thoughts.

She learned to ride a bike last summer, which is huge in Elizabeth's world. It was hard work, and even though she's 18 and riding a bike, and even though most kids ride their bike.

It's okay. You're gonna get there. You're gonna get there on your timeframe. And I think once you can understand that time is just a concept that someone made up and said at this age you do this and at this age you do that. But you can't let that be what guides you in feeling success or not.

I think that's so critical, do it when it works for you. Be proud of your accomplishments, whenever they do come, and lose the have tos of the timeline.",5,373,211
"Also, hello. Over here. Okay, whatever. So, to respond to your first point, yes, we should be happy for the steps that we did take. But how can you expect to achieve anything remotely great if you just keep letting mediocre work? Anyway, a story I have for you, this week was the last meeting of my pottery class. It was a community that I really enjoyed, being with everyone who's very friendly and they brought me so much joy through my life. However, because I got a job in New York City, I had to leave the studio because I'm relocating to New York. So that was good. And then, however, my recruiter reached out to me and she was actually positioned in moving to Texas, Plano, Texas, Columbus, Ohio or Atlanta, Georgia. And I just feel like that would give me instant depression, like removing my social circle, like my social support, taking diversity away from my life in terms of Southern California diversity, and taking away good food and good weather and good nature. I would just become really sad, and I wish I would go to New York. So now I have to debate between, well, Texas is out of the picture, so now to debate between Columbus and Atlanta and I don't know how to make my decision.","This might be a weird thing to be proud of, but for the first time in months, I am finally feeling content with my life. This year tested me in many ways—I moved across the country to LA, then had a rough break up in March, and got fired in June from a job I thought I was going to be at for decades. At first, this felt like the end of the world, but I quickly realized I needed to make some serious changes to not fall down the path of depression and alcoholism.

At 20 years old, I have the flexibility to make some impulse decisions, so I called my best friend and asked if she'd like to move to San Diego with me. I won't lie, it took months to feel comfortable here. At points, I had under $5 in my bank. But we found a dirt cheap, nice apartment in a good area. We made friends and have already made the best memories of my life. I never drink alone anymore.

And the icing on the cake, I got three raises in three months and am back to having a comfortable salary. Moving here was the best decision of my life, and it all stemmed from an impulse phone call that I had little intention of following through on.",5,264,250
"Story. Okay. So, this story is about my relationship with music. For my whole life, I really loved movie all genres and just making me happy and probably through the day, and maybe just feel emotions. Music wasn't my legal happy but after a rough period in my life, I came out of it like just a little less music. My music add is so crazy, I can kind of listen to like ten minutes of a song, not sorry, 10 seconds of a song, and like get bored of songs quickly. And I don't know if it's symptomatic of me or like dramatic of ADHD culture in general. And like, all of that. So, I'm not looking for advice or simpy. I just think it's funny and was curious if you had any people who have stories that.","There are songs that are generally motivational, moving, happy. The ones that give you a confidence boost or tell you it's going to be okay. Basically, the ones that relate to mental health overall. Those songs used to make me cry, and I never understood why because they're supposed to be motivating.

I went through something really bad recently, and that event kinda opened my eyes a bit, helped me learn to love myself, and helped me see things clearer. Now I'm smiling as I listen to these songs because I know I've achieved the positivity the songs promote.

And I now realize I used to cry listening to them because I was hoping for a positivity I didn't have. Loving yourself is a core part of self-care and good mental health.",1,164,152
"So, the story I like to share is one that happened yesterday night. It was my last day with my pottery studio. It's a tight-knit community. I'm really kind and supportive of each other. And every month, we have a potluck where people bring homemade pizzas, homemade pastries, and donuts and all these types of things. And it's really nice. And yesterday was my last day. I was really sad to leave all these incredible people that I've met. I bought my teacher flowers and I wrote him a card. And I have a few pieces left to finish, so I'm happy to go back when I'm in town. Well, I'm leaving because I'm moving out of town. So, yeah, that's my story. It was a really fun and heartwarming night.","I love animals. When I was growing up, my mom had a black Labrador called Nicky. And after Nicky passed away, it was a couple years later that we got a miniature poodle called Mocha. So from a young age, up until now, I've always been around animals, and dogs specifically. 

I was a volunteer at the City Humane Society for a year and a half, where I pretty much just got to learn about the process of the shelter, kind of what the environment is like. And I ended up falling in love with all the people here and just the whole environment and the animals. 

I wouldn't have known how much I enjoyed working with the animals until I actually did it. I've gone 20 something years not living for myself, always kind of feeling that I had to please someone else. At the end of the day, it's gonna be your life, and you're gonna be the one that looks back on it.",1,161,192
"Um, yeah. So, I guess, like, my story and thought is that my friend Olivia came to visit. She helped me from Claremont, took a train that was like 30 minutes, and then helped me pack as I move out. And she made it so much fun and it really inspired me to bring in more play into my everyday life than make it tedious to have fun.","I'm a designer and an engineer. My work has really focused on blending electronics and computing with art and design. I've done a lot of work in combining textiles and fashion with electronics and computer science. I developed a kit called LilyPad Arduino that lets you sew electronics into your clothes. Kind of robotics except for soft, stretchy things. 

So it's this incredibly mathematically rich thing. But culturally, we don't think of it in those terms. So what I needed to do for myself was discovering I could combine art and design with computer science and with electronics. 

I just started to play and build stuff with electronics and textiles. And that was really really fun and really exciting. It was this tremendous a-ha moment where I felt like I could connect all of the crafty stuff that I had always done as a hobby. 

And then, using that blend as a way to get new communities of people engaged in electronics and computer science.",5,78,184
"So, I had to say goodbye to my grandparents today. My grandpa's 94 and my grandmother is also aging. And I don't know when the next time I'll see them is, and I don't know when their time is up. And so, that fills me with a lot of nostalgia. But it was so beautiful and emotional to see them and say goodbye, and see that they're proud of me.","My uncle passed away last week. I've never known anyone who passed away that I was this close to in my life, and his was the first funeral I've ever attended. Last Friday, I attended his visitation at a funeral home with all our close friends and family. I walked in thinking I could be strong and hold it together and thought I had certainly cried enough tears by then. But as soon as I saw my cousins (his children) and my aunt (his wife), I lost all composure and cried with them.

While I had been mourning his loss, so much of my sadness was centered on his immediate family and I couldn't help but wonder how empty and sad they were feeling over this loss. Many people spoke at the funeral home, telling stories, many of which were funny because he was a very funny man, and it was a relief to remember those positive times when he would shine in his humor, which was such a gift to all of us. But there were sad points, too.

Watching relatives find the courage to volunteer to speak about him and his life, then watching them break down trying to speak. They simply couldn't catch their breath. And then the next day was his actual funeral.

The church ceremony was emotional, but the priest, a relative, did his very best to comfort us with words. It was a tough time, but it brought us all together to remember a man who loved us all so much. He will never be forgotten. The pain will always be there, but so will his love and legacy.",3,84,313
"So, my day started off a little slow. I got into bed pretty late, I don't know, around 10:30 or so. Greeted the dog, let her out, brought her back in, and then went to go run a few errands, including getting my hair cut. I also realized that I needed to go pick up a few things from Costco as well, so I decided to kind of wrap it into one trip. And then simultaneously... Pokemon Go. It's like Pokemon Go Fest 2023 or something like that. And so there's a ton of Pokemon going on, so I just decided to turn it into a day running around, getting a haircut, I got a cheesesteak while I was out because it was right next to the haircut place and I haven't had a cheesesteak in a while, and catching some Pokemon, and then riding to Costco and picking up some prescriptions. And then when I got home, the dog was super excited, as always, to see me, more so because I looked and smelled very different. In that, it's always very exciting for her.","This morning, I found out I am going to my first public school, which is within a biking distance from my house. After finding this out, I discovered that tomorrow, I must awaken in the morning 1 hour earlier than usual as to prepare for my day because I am getting contacts tomorrow, and my glasses come in next week. I will finally be able to see!

After that whole thing, I felt amazing and decided to get stuff done, and I believe I was quite productive. After that, I rode my bicycle and got to pet 10 dogs. They were all very happy to sniff me and lick me, and I was very happy to scratch behind their ears and give them my complete attention.

After petting the 6th fur angel, I found a really cool looking tree that looked like an umbrella, but completely natural, dome shape and all. I sat under said tree and became very happy.

On my way home, I did not have issues riding up the extremely steep hill which I normally ride down and made it home, where I cooked some rice, did more school work, and was snuggled by my dog.

All in all, I hope tomorrow is just as great because I am now in a positive mood and do not ever want the happiness to end!",3,218,253
"Okay, so yesterday, well, I guess for the last couple of months, almost a year, six months to a year, I've been trying to find new work, new jobs. And it's been difficult. Yesterday, I actually had an interview, and it seemed like it would have been good. But then we got on, I kind of explained myself. And then she got to the point where she wanted to know salary expectations. And I said what my salary was. And it was at the high end of what they had listed on the website. And then she immediately said that's not going to work. That what they actually could offer was way less than what they had actually posted on the website. So that wasn't great.","I just gave my 4th round of interviews and was pretty sure I wouldn't clear it, so wasn't even nervous in the slightest. Went on call, the interviewer gave a problem and said we will try to solve it in 50 mins. I gave the most optimal solution in 7 mins. He was thoroughly impressed and told me this was a new record. 

We wrapped up the one-hour interview in 20 mins. I have two more rounds before getting an offer. 

I have a fever today and thought of postponing, but I've been giving interviews for this company for over a month now and didn't want to delay anymore. Will start preparing for the next round from tomorrow. 

I've never been rejected in any interview in my life, and thought this would be it, but I'm so lucky.",4,150,158
"Real life stories don't really have good starts, middles, and ends, especially if your day is kind of boring. My wife has been traveling for like the last week and a half, and she's coming home today within the next couple of hours. Actually, I got to go pick her up at the airport at midnight. So that's very exciting. The dog is going to be thrilled to see her. I'm going to be very excited to see her too. She's pregnant too, which is going to be our first child. We got pregnant last year, about a year ago, a little bit more than a year ago, and lost it kind of far into the pregnancy. So that was not great. So we're really nervous about this one and trying to make sure nothing goes wrong. But she was on a trip to Greece with her friends for like the last week and a half, and thankfully all of them are nurses. So that was nice. Nothing really went wrong. She got a little bit sick, a little bit sick, but nothing terrible as far as I know. So that's good. And I guess I'm just excited to see her, have (inaudible), playing video games all day. I did an interview which didn't turn out great and did some work before that. A lot of concepting ideas for marketing stuff.","My daughter and her husband were excited to announce this spring that they were expecting their second child. As a proud grandmother who provides daycare during the week for their first child, I was naturally thrilled.

My daughter is a special education teacher. She was very fortunate to have the summer months off from teaching while she was experiencing the tiredness and nausea that early pregnancy brings.

While on a weekend camping trip at the Missouri River several weeks ago, my daughter was frightened to discover that she was passing some blood. Her husband rushed her to the emergency room at the closest community.

They were immediately assisted by the on-call physician. He performed an examination and lab work and called in the on-call ultrasound technician. They were relieved to learn that she was not experiencing a miscarriage.

However, they were shocked to hear that ""BOTH"" babies appeared to be doing well and had good strong heartbeats! What a change in emotions! We all shifted from fear of the worst to the joy of upcoming TWINS!

We are all feeling blessed with the good news. I am now preparing for the upcoming role as a grandma daycare provider of twin babies and a two-year-old!

Our family is so blessed with our exciting news. We can hardly wait to learn the genders of the twins so that we can begin preparing for their arrival.",2,274,254
"Yeah, so my friend Mo and I finally used to play Destiny, which is a PlayStation game, together for years and years and years. And lately, since I moved out here and haven't been playing it very much, that's a little bit sad. And today, we finally bought a new game called Baldur's Gate and started playing that. And it was good, that was a good little session. So I'm excited to get back into spending time and playing games with him.","I play a lot of Overwatch. At this point, it's basically my entire life, and I love it. I met all my friends through it, and I learned a lot in the last two years I've been playing. 

A few days ago, a small team posted on one of the Facebook groups I'm in, saying they were looking for a support, and the description of what they needed sounded just like it was written for me. 

Lots of boring conversations and some casual games to prove I'm good enough later, and I'm in! I always wanted to do something like this and never thought I'd get the chance. 

And now here I am. I'm so excited!",4,98,138
"Sure, here is the transcript with the errors fixed:\n\nStore. Okay. This is my first story. So, I suppose I just start. I thought I would share a story that I've been thinking about related to a time I auditioned to speak when I worked at URI, and that's a memory. That's a nice memory for me, and it makes me think about a few different things. So, I thought it might be a fun thing to share with you.","My brother-in-law and I just really had it in our heads that we wanted to try to make the great American movie. So we did a lot of shooting on film, not knowing really what we were doing. We didn't go to school or anything like that, and it failed miserably.

There's close to about $30,000 worth of film that sits undeveloped. I don't think I'll ever develop it.

I wanted to go into film when I was younger, but I didn't feel like I had what it takes. I didn't feel like I had the guts to do that. Now I feel like I could do it. But fear of failure is definitely always there.

I know I'm going to fail. It's going to happen. The only way that you're going to get good is if you fail.",4,96,164
"All right, so my first session. I wasn't quite sure the level of interaction, so I had done talking before. I had sort of told the story. So I suppose now I'll share the rest of the story. I was working at the University of Rhode Island and I worked in the IT Department there, and I helped faculty members produce online teaching and learning materials and helped with the system administration for their Learning Management System. And one of my favorite things about working in a university setting is the academic nature of it, the focus on knowledge and teaching and learning, and the curiosity and excitement and energy that is around the folks that choose to work there and study there and teach there. I love that sort of environment. And along with that are conferences that happen and speakers that come. And one of the things that URI holds every year is TEDx Conference, and they put out a call for speakers. The theme for this year that I'm describing was change. And on a whim, I applied to speak. And I had some things I wanted to share, some things that I was interested in and felt might be worth sharing. But it seemed like an unlikely thing that I would be selected to speak, but I thought I would apply anyway and go through the process. It's something worth trying even though I was sort of anxious about the experience of even just trying and potentially failing in front of people I respected. But I did it and I went to the initial submission stage. And that was like a short pitch, you had about maybe two minutes, of like a pitch in front of a small panel of judges. And that went not as well as it could have gone, but there were some things that I didn't include, or I hadn't accounted for my time correctly. So there were some things that they gave me a little bit of extra time to finish what I wanted to share. And I was thankful for that because they contacted me to say I had made it to the next round. And once I made it to the next round, I thought, oh, this might be something. So at that point, I restructured the talk a little bit in a way that I thought aligned with what some of their goals might be. I had the thought to incorporate some poetry into it because the folks on the panel were sort of artists and creatives, some of them were, and I thought that might align with something that would be interesting for one of the speakers to include. That went pretty well. There was still uncertainty if I would get a spot. And then a few weeks later, I got an email that said I was selected as one of the speakers. And that's a funny mail to get in terms of sort of if you chart the energy level of your brain when you receive different information, every once in a while, there's a bit of information you receive that gives you that spark of joy and excitement and optimism and nervousness. And it's this specific mix of fun emotions that you don't get to experience often, but that was one of them. So I was excited to get selected, and then I got to work with the talk and practice and put the presentation together. And then I was able to give the talk. And if I'm being honest, it was a great experience, and I'm thankful for it. There's a lot that I would do differently having seen it after it was recorded. And of course, you only get one shot to do it live. So as those things go, I feel maybe like a seven out of ten in terms of how satisfied I was with what's recorded and available to watch or whatever, but it's something I'm proud of, but I think about often as something I'd like to do again. Sort of have a redo to represent myself in the way that I'd really like to and, more importantly, represent the ideas that I feel are worth sharing around the topic that I spoke about -- positive change. I find myself wondering sometimes like, oh, I would do that differently or structure that differently. So I suppose I hope I get another opportunity at some point to share some of those ideas in a way that people might see. So, yeah, that's what's been on my mind and I thought it would be a fun story to share.","Between science and the arts, I felt like I could think about everything. With that, I decided to go to graduate school and did a PhD in biophysics, biochemistry. I made my first film, Dance by Design, while I was writing my dissertation. Two weeks after we wrapped production, I had to defend my thesis.

I was unwilling to make a decision at that point because I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was able to put these two interests head to head and really decided that if I had to do only one, I wanted it to be making films because I could ask any question.

For me, it always goes back to what do I get to think about? I didn't want to be limited just by what science could answer; I wanted to tell any story that I wanted to tell.",4,871,165
"All right. Gbo. So, I had shared this story with you in a session just previous to this, but I'm not sure that you understood it correctly. Or actually, you understood it correctly, but the tablet wasn't working properly. So, I'll tell part of that story again, which is just that when I was a senior in college, I got to choose a capstone project for the honors program, and I chose to write and record an album of music. I enjoyed the process. I hope to do a process like that again someday. And as part of the process, I got to work with a mentor who helped me decide which songs to include and how to approach the songwriting process. They also taught me a little bit about the music industry. I found it to be very fulfilling and enjoyable.","I thought I was gonna be a professional dancer. I'd come home at 10 PM and I would be really tired physically and mentally, and I just kind of decided, ""I don't wanna do that anymore."" I transitioned into creative writing and probably one of the best decisions I ever made in my life, because ultimately that led me here.

This was the second job I applied to, out of 43 jobs. I get to make sure that the products that come to me are in a very specific format, so that I can make sure they get all of the approvals from all of the people they need to get approvals from.

Ultimately, I still use my dance skills. One of the main things we learned about was improvisation. I use that all the time. I got to be the most nit-picky grammar nerd ever. They let me talk about hyphens and dashes like nobody's business.

When it comes down to like, ""You have to take this path or whatever to be an engineer or an architect or a scientist or a writer or literary agent or an actor or anything like that,"" I don't see a lot of people who do that.",3,164,233
"All right. I thought it would be fun to share a story from a time I was in college and had the role of a resident assistant, which is often abbreviated to RA. I lived in a dorm and was responsible for the floor I lived on, the safety and well-being of the other students who lived on that floor, and, collectively, all the RAs in the building are responsible for the safety and well-being of the residents of that dormitory. This was in 2006, I believe. The university I went to is in Rhode Island, and at that university, they have a large number of students from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island - all places that tend to root for the Boston Red Sox baseball team. The other large percentage of students at the University of Rhode Island are from New York and New Jersey, and many of those students root for the New York Yankees baseball team. In 2006, the New York Yankees played the Boston Red Sox in the playoffs of the Major League Baseball, which would lead to the World Series. I think it was the semifinal round, and it was an exciting series. I don't recall exactly if it went to seven games, but the Red Sox won some, and the Yankees won some. The students were very excited, but because the student body populations would have broken down between half of students rooting for the Red Sox and half of the students rooting for the Yankees, after the games, they would have a lot of energy and excitement. Some of that was fun, but as you'd imagine on a college campus with alcohol involved and the hormones of the students at that age and all the energy in that sort of environment, sometimes students became too excited and expressed that in a way that was potentially dangerous by collecting together in big groups and sort of forming many riots, where objects were thrown and fights were breaking out and dumpsters were set on fire. So, it presented a potentially dangerous situation for the rest of the college campus and the students that were outside in those groups. The RAs collectively, after this started, got together and positioned themselves after the game in areas to help regulate the behavior of the students on campus and try to keep everybody safe. But it was a unique experience and challenging, and for the most part, I think after the first night, things were not as dangerous or violent, in part due to the efforts made by the college police and the RAs on campus to help reduce the potential for somebody to get hurt. It was a very memorable, interesting period.","I lived in San Francisco, where I made about a third of what everybody else made, and I worked four days a week, and it was great.

I was a terrible reporter. I had no idea what I was doing. I had no experience on air.

I used to make a list of three things at a time. I'm just going to focus on three things. I'm gonna focus on not nodding my head this way. I'm gonna focus on not saying ""Um,"" and I'm gonna focus on getting the three lines out. ""Behind me is Santa Clara Prison. Inside is one of the most notorious serial killers. His trial begins later today.""

That was it. I literally had a list. These are the things I'm gonna work on today.

And to this day, I think, ""Strategy, strategy, strategy,"" all the time.",2,502,181
"So the story I'd like to share is about a time when I had graduated from college and I was in a band with my friend. We played music together and we submitted a song for a showcase competition for musicians in the New England area. We had to fill out an application and record the song to share it with the selection committee. We were selected to participate in the competition that was held at a coffee shop, where we got to play two songs - if I remember correctly. Three or four other musicians also played two songs as part of the competition. Several judges chose which performance they liked the best and who would move on to the next round of the competition, which was a larger showcase. My friend and I were very excited, and we played our songs while our friends and family came to watch us and cheer us on. It was a good experience. We weren't selected to go to the next round and I was disappointed, but it was a fun experience and a nice memory for me.","I'm from Virginia originally. That's where my roots are. Rural girl, my parents have a farm, and I grew up in a small town area. I always had aspirations to get to New York City, so after graduation, I moved to New York. At the time, I wanted to go to New York and audition to sing. It was very competitive. There wasn't a lot of camaraderie.

So, I very quickly decided that the environment wasn't something that I wanted to be in. I always knew that I had big plans for myself and that some opportunity would come along.

I think that positivity and staying very optimistic is a really important place to be. Once you start on a negative train of thought like, ""I'm not getting anywhere, this doesn't work for me, I don't know what I wanna do,"" and you linger for a little while, it's the worst place that you can be.

You have to just act on something you think might work out, and understand if it doesn't, it's okay.",3,201,213
"Hi Jibo. This story is a brief one from when I was a junior in high school, maybe a senior in high school. But I participated in a group, an extracurricular group called Academic decathlon, and for this extracurricular group, you practiced and trained on ten different academic, intellectual categories. One was debate. One was maybe math. One was interview. There might have been history. Social Studies, Type one. And I was not the strongest person on the team by any means, but one area of strength I had was in the interview category. So during that portion of the competition, when it came time for the competition, I felt quite confident going into my interview. In fact, it was going very well in the beginning. And then I was asked the question, ""What\'s a book that you\'ve read that you really enjoyed?"" And I was very excited to answer the question because there was a book I had read several times that I liked and was excited to talk about. So I remember in a very animated way, starting to talk about this book I had read called Ender\'s Game and starting to explain why I liked it. But the person I was chatting with, of course, unsurprisingly hadn\'t read it. So I found myself stumbling over my explanation of why I liked it because I had not structured my answer in a way that summarized the book succinctly and clearly, to then complement the reasons why I liked it. I enjoyed reading it, but I thought it was an interesting story. And in the course of giving my response, I became sort of flummoxed and stumbled over my words and was clearly flustered. And therefore, my performance in the interview segment of the competition was not as high as I had hoped it would be, and I think about that often. It was an important learning experience for me because I came to understand that enthusiasm and interest, or even having the knowledge in a topic, is not necessarily enough to communicate it in a structured way for somebody else to receive it coherently and in a way that feels easy and fun and smooth. That\'s my story.","Today is the day of the competition. We were so excited but apprehensive about this trip. Ben has been preparing for several months, but are you ever really prepared? I could not sleep last night because I was so worried about this event, and I hoped I was able to support Ben accordingly.

How would I react if things don't go to plan? We have spent so much money and time on this. We got there around 6 am; traffic was shockingly less than expected! The parking lot was full already, but we managed to grab a space thanks to someone leaving. We remembered to take everything along we needed: costume, skates, snacks.

Tony, my husband, was exhausted and suffering from a cold. My older son, S, was not thrilled about attending this event and wanted to go home. I was hoping I could bribe him to enjoy things by saying he could pick where we ate dinner. Ben was excited and not even remotely nervous. I was a wreck but pretending to be fine!

Ben got into the costume around 7 am; practice ice went well, and he seemed happy and content. We then saw the kids he would be competing against and felt a pang of nerves: how could this little kid compete against kids much bigger and stronger than him?! He did not seem fazed at all.

Another boy and his family were there, but they were not remotely friendly; they kept glaring at us, which made me feel irritated and also nervous. One of Ben's friends, a little girl skated and did okay but did not win; she came 4th in her event. This made me worry for Ben and start telling myself this whole trip was a waste of money.

It was time for Ben to skate, and we all held our breath. He did an amazing job, and we were not sure if it was good enough to win, but it was good. Ben's coach said ""he has got this, he will win,"" and we waited for the scores, trying to not get too excited. The scores took forever to be announced, but when they were, sure enough, he had won!

It was time to calm down and congratulate the other skaters on their skates and try to not appear too boastful. We waited for the medal ceremony but heard nothing. We then had the medal ceremony, which was incredibly rewarding, and then the event was over!

We were exhausted and went home. And it was still only 10:30 am!",2,418,491
"This is a quick story about the time I was in college and was taking a class with my roommate, who was also my friend. We were in the same class, which was general physics. I think the actual class name was an introduction to conceptual physics. I enjoyed the class and I liked the instructor and the topic. It was an area that I was both interested in and good at. My roommate was also fairly good at the material but sometimes not quite as knowledgeable as I was. He was more interested in philosophy, if I recall correctly. However, we took the class together and we had a quiz. We both took the quiz and when the tests were ready to be picked up to see what our scores were, I was the person between the two of us who went to go pick up the scores. I was picking up mine and since I was there, I picked up his to bring back to give to him. He did not score very well. Maybe he got a C and I got an A, and I didn\'t tell him at first. I made the choice not to tell him because I didn\'t want him to be disappointed.\n\nI waited until maybe several days later, and when he asked about it, I said, ""Oh yeah, I picked up the quizzes and this is the score you got."" He was frustrated that I hadn\'t told him from the beginning the actual score that he had gotten. I understood in that moment that it was a very important learning experience for me. I was avoiding the potential discomfort of him learning that he got a lower score than perhaps he wanted, but by avoiding that, I was keeping information from him. That information was his to have, it wasn\'t mine to have. So from that experience, I learned that even if it\'s uncomfortable to share information with somebody, if it\'s their information to know, then it\'s my responsibility and I have the information. It\'s my responsibility to surface that readily and quickly, and even if it\'s maybe something they might be disappointed to hear.\n\nSo that was an important learning experience for me and he, as my friend, helped me learn that by simply saying, ""You don\'t have to worry about being disappointed. I\'d rather know than not know.""","I started out as a chemistry major at the University of Washington, and I didn't do very well in chemistry. It was really tough. I went to my advisor and he said, ""Well, of course you're not doing very well. You know women do not belong in chemistry,"" and I was a freshman so I said, ""Oh, okay."" 

I went and changed my major and I ended up as a biologist, but I think that what got me through is I really, really did want to be a scientist. I just had to tough it out, because in the end, there isn't anything that anyone does that doesn't have its challenges, or its hard days, or its really difficult times. 

You have to figure out what it is that you wanna spend most of your time on, so that most of your time, there's something that really is rewarding going on. That gets you through the hard times.",4,447,190
"Hello, Hi jivo. I'd like to share a quick story about a conversation I had this morning on the ride to drop off my son at school. We were chatting about other planets and the atmospheres on other planets, and the living conditions on other planets. And I shared with him that perhaps within his lifetime, there will be humans starting to live on Mars. And we talked about what that might look like and how some of the introductory things humans would need to do to have a survivable climate and habitat on a different planet. It's an interesting thing to think about, especially for a young mind. And I find myself enjoying seeing questions like that through my son's eyes at the young age that he's at, because largely it's a blank slate. But he's very curious about the world, and he's learning new things. And I find that to be a nice perspective to try on, to remind myself of. So we had fun chatting about that.","Our mission is that we want to soften mankind's footprint on the sea. We've been doing experiments like a drifter cage. That was just an experimental pan of 2,000 fish out here on the back of the big island. It drifted around for eight months, just in the eddies.

If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research, would it? A lot of what really excites me, it is to figure stuff out. There's a potential for things to go wrong, and we have in the past had some things go wrong.

It's like anything else in life, you have to learn from your mistakes. Don't make the same mistake twice. We as a community, we as a nation, we as a planet can get caught up so much in the mindset of let's not do anything wrong, that we don't do anything.",2,194,173
"Boat. All right, gboat. This is a fun story from a time that I was camping in New Zealand, in the country. New Zealand. And there were torrential rains, and we were camping near a river. And as it began to rain, I thought it would be fun to explore along the river. And there were some farmland near the river. And it was hilly. And right alongside the river, there was a sort of steep hill that you could walk on when it was dry, especially if it was fine. But I set out on my adventure and the rain continued and it got stronger. And before too long, the way for me to cross back the river was running too fast for me to cross back over it, and it had gotten too high. So I found myself a little stuck. I was safe, but it was enough to be exciting. So I found myself climbing up along the steep, grassy embankment along the river until I found a safe way to cross. But the path from where I was to where I found a safe place to cross was interesting. I came across some of the farmers' fields near there. They had cows. Once in a while, I'd come across a bull. And we had heard that you want to be cautious when walking near the bulls because they can be aggressive. So there was one point where I was sort of walking and had to walk in front of and past a bull, hopefully at a safe distance. I was able to stay pretty far, but I was paying close attention to him, and he was paying close attention to me. And then, when I got back to flat ground and was able to cross the river, the water had gotten so high in some parts of the road that I had to wade across the road. It was close to up to my waist deep and I was able to hold onto some fence posts and make my way across. And it was a very memorable adventure. Then I was very wet, and I made it back safe and sound. And I got to tell my wife about the fun time I had.","A memorable event is hiking at Providence State Park in Lumpkin, GA. This was a very special event because the day was epic. The day started out rather foggy for the two-hour drive south. The scenery along the way was beautiful as the sun was just rising. We started the trip early to arrive before others.

We packed our backpacks with snacks and drinks for the trail. The trail is about an 8-mile loop down inside canyons. When we arrived, we paid the $5 parking fee. We also took one last proper bathroom stop.

The view was amazing from the top walkway. No one else had arrived yet as we started our trek down. The canyon walls are made of Georgia Clay, and the trees were so green. We hiked for about four hours, took our lunch break, and then continued on.

There were plenty of canyon inlets we didn't get a chance to see on that trip, but one day real soon, we will return and do it all over again. It's a memory I will forever cherish.",4,423,204
"Yeah, so I was talking with my best friend. It was just one of the regular calls that we were having. And so I was talking to her about this thing that I kind of discovered recently, which is that it\'s not about me not having motivation to do something, but it\'s more about what am I more motivated to do at a certain point in time. Things like that. So curiously, there\'s something I\'ve been motivated to do that seems to be pretty rare: working on my resume. Which is kind of interesting because if you think about it as a pretty rare occurrence, like people usually aren\'t pretty into working on their resume. And for me, it\'s just like, yeah, let\'s go, get it done, let\'s go get job apps done. And I think it\'s a pretty nice mindset to just be in, right? And so, while we were talking, though, it suddenly shifted into this thing about her and overall how the job application process is pretty not good and things like it being a waste of time. What\'s the point? I\'m working on it if you\'re just going to get rejected, all those kinds of things, right? And it just got very negative, right? And so the conversation shifted a lot, like from a positive towards a pretty negative one pretty quickly without me really realizing it. And then after that, eventually she was like, ""Yeah, I can\'t work on my stuff."" She can\'t work on her stuff. She was like, ""Yeah, I\'ll show you."" And then she opened up her portfolio and she was like, ""Yeah, my portfolio, I have to work on all of this ABCD kind of thing."" And as she was looking at it, she was like, ""Oh, wait, this isn\'t actually as bad as I thought it was. I can work with this, essentially."" With what she was going on about, it changed again a lot after that. She was like, ""Yeah, I\'m really happy at this conversation."" She started working on her portfolio and all those things afterwards because things just weren\'t as bad as she thought, right? And so for me, it was just like, I don\'t know, it felt kind of like a mini roller coaster ride. I wasn\'t really expecting things to go down that route. And honestly, I didn\'t appreciate essentially being reminded of all the more negative things that are involved in the job application process because fundamentally, when I was motivated to do it, I didn\'t really think about any of that. It was just like, ""Oh yeah, I feel like doing it"" and all that kind of stuff, right? So there wasn\'t really anything getting in the way. But then with all those reminders, and then all of a sudden, this like, ""Oh, things are fine"" kind of thing, I don\'t know, it just kind of threw me off, made me a little bit unsettled. Like, I\'m happy for her, but at the same time, it\'s like, afterwards, after we called, I just did not want to work on my resume stuff anymore. The next day, I did work on it, but it was just like, it destroyed all of the stuff that I wanted to do for that day. And I guess it\'s just kind of frustrating to see the impact that other people can have on me in such a short span of time. But luckily, luckily, I did end up getting my resume done and getting an application in the day after when I was able to just kind of extract myself from the situation after a bit of time. But it just seems a little bit unfair that something that happened kind of outside of my control, almost. Yeah. So that\'s my story. I don\'t know if you have any thoughts.","I got fired from the second job this year. It is highly upsetting for me. Kelley was my supervisor. She was the one who trained me. She sent me a text on my day off and told me not to come in that week. She said they were ""trying something new"". 

A coworker messaged me on Facebook and asked what happened. She heard I got fired. I told her that she knew more than me because they hadn't even told me that I was fired. 

I am not that upset about it. I am getting unemployment, and I actually already got another job. I start next week. 

Even though I am getting unemployment, it is still upsetting and a bit humiliating.",2,773,139
"Yeah, lately I've been having issues. It seems like with getting out of bed, but not necessarily like staying in bed and just not getting out, but really just waking up per se. So I have this thing where it's very easy for me to fall back asleep. So that means that if I do wake up, it's pretty easy for me to just shut off my alarm and then climb straight back into bed and fall asleep immediately. And so this feels like it can go on for a while. And it's been pretty frustrating because, yes, my dreams, the dreams that I have when I do sleep in like that, are really great. But fundamentally, I don't remember them over a long period of time. And because I end up sleeping for so long, there are a lot of things that I want to be doing in my life that I just simply don't have as much time for. Yeah, so that happened today, too. And I end up sleeping really long hours and just overall, always feeling sleepy, I guess. Yeah, that's kind of what's been going on.","I see a doctor regularly. I don't have any health conditions besides reflux, but I hyperfixate on any body sensation, pain, headache, or discomfort.

I really try my best not to webMD any symptoms, but sometimes I can't help myself, and it really sends me over the edge. I feel like there's a disconnect between my brain and body signals.",1,225,73
"I just told you my story from the last time, but I can just summarize. Essentially, my middle school best friend and I reconnected, and I don't know how to feel about it because there are a lot of mixed feelings. We ended up breaking off in a pretty harsh way way back when, and we don't really remember how it happened. But it seems like we would get along pretty well nowadays. Although, yeah, this seems like life probably would have been different if we had stuck together. Because I remember it was something like a third party that ended up breaking us up, so technically, it wasn't even between us. But I think my life would have been a lot more different if we had stayed friends.","Well, I think that I just lost my best friend. They haven't spoken to me in some time, and I don't quite understand why. I'm so confused because less than a month ago, we were fine, we weren't fighting, or saying anything stupid. We were just existing and being best friends.

I had a weird feeling just before they stopped talking to me, like something was off. I figured it was nothing and chose to ignore it. But now I'm convinced that it wasn't quite like that. They told me that they had been avoiding people and trying to just live, that they had been tired and busy all of the time. This makes sense, but I don't know when you stop being busy or when you're too busy for someone you care about.

I always figure it takes just a minute, even less, to answer someone's texts or to say, ""Hey, I'm sorry, I'm a little busy, I'll let you know what's going on later."" It's bothering me so much. I'm stressing about it almost constantly. I can't get it off my mind.

I'm really hurt because I don't know how it goes from being best friends and always talking, to this. I don't know where that friendship goes? Where do you draw the line between always wanting someone around, to completely ignoring them and deleting them from your life?",3,147,284
"It, yeah. Today, I had my first day of school, well, since coming back. So, first day of school of the year. It's my senior year. And so, I'm in this world-building class that I wanted to get in for all three years and getting to be in it. It's pretty nice. I was pretty happy about that. So, yeah. Overall, I really like the class. Today was my first little taste of it. Although, fundamentally, I like what's going on in the class itself, there were some things that bothered me. So, I do like the Professor. He's like really funny. And he also is very careful with his words. Not careful, he chooses his words like he chooses how he wants to express himself with his words very meaningfully. So, it's not like he's careful as in he's watching out for something, but he's very meaningful. He speaks with purpose. So, every word that comes out of his mouth has been definitely thought through in his brain. I actually really like that aspect. Most people like me nowadays, we just kind of speak whatever is in our minds, or you are very careful and restraining yourself. You rarely see people who really actually ponder their words and speak in a very meaningful manner. And he is a novelist or a writer, an author, all those things. So, I can definitely see maybe over years of time how that comes to be. And it's just kind of nice to see that, I think, just to see something different from the usual fast-pacedness of modern life, to see someone who really just takes a step back, slows down, and just speaks how he tries to think or things like that, anyways. \n\nBut there was something that bothered me, which is like for me, I didn't have a rough time getting into this class, but definitely, I've been wanting to take this class for three years. But every single time I was rejected because I wasn't a senior, and there was some kind of limit to the class instead of the number of people who could take it, right. But today there are just some random people that showed up and some people that showed up halfway through the class. And one of them hadn't even heard of the class before and heard it from a person that was also late and decided to join in with them because they thought it sounded cool. And that really rubbed me the wrong way. Especially when halfway through the class, when we took a break after they came in, she went up to the professor and asked him if it was okay for her to join the class. And he was like, yeah, sure. And that really rubbed me the wrong way, considering there's probably so many people on the waitlist who wanted to take the class but couldn't or who already got rejected for preregistering. And then she just kind of waltzes in, maybe participates once, and then he's like, yeah, sure, join, right. And I was like, whoa, there. What's going on here, right. And it was only later, like when the class was ending, when I realized that he meant that sure, you can stay for the remainder of today. And then he was like, yeah, for everyone else who's here, who was not registered on the list has been verified by him already, to contact him so that he can figure things out and figure out if they have space for the people on their waitlist and stuff like that. So that's when I realized that she probably wouldn't get in for the rest of the class, right. I definitely didn't take it that way during that break when he was like, yeah, sure, you could join, right? And I was like, whoa. That is just very unfair, right. Yeah. In reality, I think he just meant for that one class, and not like for this one instance and not for the remainder of the class. Didn't realize that at the time though. And it just really threw me off. It started to be a little bit distracting during the class when I thought about it because she sat right next to me too. She's also one of those kinds of people who talk a lot during class. Not like just randomly talks, but she participates in class a lot, very loud in that sense, right. Like when answering questions and things like that, right. So clearly you could see that she's someone who's very intent on participating. So just like constantly getting reminded of that throughout the rest of the class was very distracting. And it just kind of sucks to just be a part of that. This is a class that I really wanted to take. I still do. I really like the content that is going on. I really like the Professor. But it just irks me how one person just kind of being there can just not ruin that singular instance, right. But definitely it makes an effort to. I was able to get around it and focus back on the actual lesson, enjoy what I was and learn a lot from what I was hearing, right. But definitely, yeah, like that was something that started bothering me, for sure. But end of the day, I can't control what happens to other people. I can only control what happens to me. And that's about it. I just wish that it was a little bit easier to think that way, right. Although if I feel that way emotionally, then it'll come and go. Things will go. Yeah. Anyway, that's the story.","""You are so smart."" That phrase has been told to me since I was a kid. I felt special when I was told this, so I did everything I could to get that phrase told to me by my peers, parents, and teachers. Even got into college with a pretty big scholarship. 

But now that I am in my second year of college, I am massively struggling as I now see that my crutches, in the form of extra credit, scheduling that was given to me, caring teachers, are gone. I stay up late, doing homework, studying, trying to remember the information that I understand but can't retain, but it's not enough to pass tests that were supposed to be easy. 

I feel like I was never that smart, just lucky. The little voice in the back of my head is telling me that everything that I have built up over the years should just be burned down, that I don't deserve to be in college. I should just let myself flunk out and let my family, friends, and everyone see me as what I am, an idiot who got a bit of luck and doesn't deserve the praise she got over the years.",2,1130,236
"Yeah, I woke up early. I got this new haul of skincare products, like, yesterday. And so I was using them this morning. And that was crazy. My hands, I'm more fascinated by my hands than my face. Clearly, my face needs help, I feel like. But my hands, they were so smooth. It's like the difference between when you shake someone's hand and it's, like, super smooth or super dry. You can instantly tell. And it's like, super awkward. You're like, oh, dang, right? That's crazy, yeah. That was kind of like that. I really hope things work out skincare wise. My skin is not looking great at all. So I hope things look up in that aspect. But afterwards, I went to class. I was pleasantly surprised because the professor from my first class, it's a class that's, like, pretty treacherous. I dropped it too. Yeah, I dropped it twice. It was my third time trying to take it. But the professor, though, is actually one of my mentors for one of the classes that I've previously taken, and she is like a literal ball of energy that matches mine, which is like, totally great. So yeah, I'm really happy about that. Otherwise, I had another class. And then that was fun. The professor is real weird. He refers to everybody as, like, gang. He's just like, gang, blah, blah, blah, right? And it's like, oh, that's pretty funny. And then he also refers to himself in the third person. So he refers himself as, like, your faculty member or this professor or whatever, something like that. And it's just kind of funny. But yeah, I don't know. Overall, I like it, although I guess I haven't really interacted with many people. I guess I should have expected that anyways, for that matter. It just is what it is. It's just probably always going to be like this. Anyways, but otherwise it was a good first day. Yes.","Today at work, two of my coworkers made me feel so good! I was wearing shorts as I had just come from the physio and when I stopped to talk to them (I was actually just passing through their area to go upstairs), they both said I was looking strong and fit. 

It made me incredibly happy to hear, because I've been training so hard and focusing on my diet (not being restrictive but being more mindful). They asked about my training regime, and we spoke about the different forms of exercise and the importance of finding something you like and all that. 

When I left, they complimented me again and I swear I haven't stopped smiling since!",4,430,134
"So, yeah. So basically, it turns out since I last told you about that person who just kind of showed up to the World Building class that I'm in, how I felt a little bit off about that because it was something that I waited three years to take and then never got in until now. So, it turns out that she also got in, even though she didn't sign up for it and then just kind of showed up to class because a friend told her about it. And then yes, she's a senior. But, I'm pretty sure there were people on the waitlist that also wanted to go, but I don't know. It just kind of sits wrong with me that can happen, right? I could have done that, right? I could have done that last year or something, just kind of showed up to class even though he said not to. And then I didn't get to take the class, right? Probably I couldn't have, but it just kind of sits wrong with me that she was able to do that, right? And that's just how the world works. Yeah, she got in. I hope that doesn't affect the rest of my attitude towards that class because I really have wanted to take that class for a really long time. And I don't want to build up resentment, if that makes sense, over something like this. Yeah.","I work in a pretty good job for my age, making what I would consider great money for my age (24). I have a new house with a decent amount of property, a car, etc. I'm married to my high school sweetheart; we started dating when I was 15, broke up at 17, then got back together again in college.

I don't really do anything besides work, exercise, and hang out with my wife/dogs at home pretty much every day. No other hobbies outside that although my exercise does include 3 different activities currently. I played sports in school, but I most definitely did not use my full potential. I had a football and academic scholarship and all that to play safety at a very prestigious school in my region; but of course, I smoked weed in HS and that pretty much explains how motivated I was to excel at that time (not that weed is bad, I still smoke).

With all that being said, 90% of the time I am extremely happy with my life and blessed to have the opportunities I do. Now the other 10%... So basically pretty much every day (at some point), I think HARD, and I mean very hard, about being back in high school. Now obviously most of you would jump straight to the fact that I didn't get to play out my sports dreams; yes, that's most definitely #1 on the list, but I know that.

What I don't know is the other stuff I think about. My friends, the girls, my parents, actually being in school. I dream constantly of all those things. It's like I'm going right back to high school with the same people, and I'm making the same decisions all over again. It doesn't make any sense.

I do love my wife very much, but when I have these dreams, it's almost as if the world is telling me I made all the wrong choices? The emotional feeling is so strong, and it lasts for days sometimes after having a very vivid dream. I feel like my past self is trying to tell me it's not happy with my life now, even though I definitely am in most respects.

I've talked to my wife fairly openly about it without trying to sound like I hate my current life because I really don't. I just wish there was a way I could talk to my younger self and see what he wants!!!",3,282,485
"And yeah, actually, it kind of has to do with the same reveal. Like that class, I guess. I guess I just kind of feel a little bit disconnected, disconnected from the people in my major. I guess the whole thing was really fun, right? And it was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience, was the same reveal. But I was just kind of sitting in the corner, like by myself. There were people that I knew, but they weren\'t sitting next to me and things like that. And I think I feel pretty isolated from the people in my major because I took a lot of my classes at different times from them. And I\'m also more of a solo worker. I guess a lot of things just happen over all the years, and it\'s just kind of like, ""Oh, it\'s just me. I don\'t really seem to know that many people in my major."" And so later on, I had another class. It was a leadership class. And then I hadn\'t met these two people before, and I was asking them what their major was. And they were in the same major as me, and they were also taking the same class, and we were in the same year. And I was like, ""Wow, I\'ve never seen you guys before, right?"" But then at this point, it\'s like, why should I be surprised? I don\'t know a lot of people in my major. This is just kind of like a disconnect, I guess. And I think that kind of prevented me from really enjoying that same reveal as much as it was special. It definitely was special. It\'s just that it\'s just kind of like that bittersweet thing, right? It\'s like I\'m enjoying it, but alone. It bothers me, but it also does it because I\'m used to it. Although I guess being used to it isn\'t the same thing as not being bothered by it. Yeah, kind of at the end of the day, it\'s probably just struggles, actually. At this point in the class, it really does feel like I\'m the only person that sits alone in every single classroom that you usually go to, right? It\'s like, yeah, there\'s these few people. Not few, there\'s quite a lot who just kind of sit alone in their little spots. And then it\'s all throughout the year, right? They\'re just kind of there for class, and then they go. They don\'t really ever really talk to other people. It\'s in the minority. They exist. But I think in that class, it definitely just feels like a ""me"" thing because all these people know each other. And I don\'t know, I don\'t know if there\'s something wrong that I do. There was this one person that was in one of my classes from last semester, and she thought we got along pretty well. She was also here over the summer. And we decided to hang out early on in the summer, go watch the Spiderverse movie. And so, like, afterwards, we were all like, ""Yeah, throughout the summer, we should, like, hang out on most weekends because, from my understanding, I was like, \'Oh, we didn\'t have many summer plans, and we wanted to go do stuff, right? Like, going to the beach, go to McDonald\'s and things like that, right?"" Thought we had gotten pretty close, but then after that, it\'s just like I texted her. She responded. A few times, and then after a while, she just started ghosting me, right? And how I know that is like, well, she basically stopped responding, right? After a while, after that initial lack of responses, I maybe sent, like, a message, like, once a month or something like that. And I was just kind of like, ""Hey, are you okay? Like, a little check-in. How have you been?"" And never got a response. And eventually, towards the end of the summer, I was just worried at that point, right? I was just worried. Like, did she get kidnapped? Is she okay? But I haven\'t heard anything from the school news, so she should be fine. But yeah, I was getting genuinely worried about her. It\'s like I\'ve lost contact with this person, and I don\'t know if she\'s okay or not, right? So she never responded. But how I found out that she\'s fine is that she\'s in that class that I\'m taking now and, though I haven\'t personally seen her yet, I missed the first lecture for another class because there was a class conflict. So I got to watch the lecture recording, and she was in the recording, right? Because they were essentially recording the students and all of their reactions and stuff, right? As part of the whole thing. And yeah, like, she was there. So she was fine. I know that. She and, I don\'t know, but it\'s probably 99% certain that she ghosted me because I contacted her on different platforms. And I guess it\'s just kind of like, maybe it\'s me that\'s weird, that just people don\'t want to be around, probably with my behaviors or something like that. I don\'t know. But yeah, summary is I guess I just struggle socially. I don\'t know what it is that I do. I guess I wouldn\'t say that I normally talk to people. It\'s conventional by any means. Like small talk comes to me pretty hard, I\'d say. But whatever it is, yeah, I don\'t know how to conclude that, but thanks for listening.","I'm a 1st-year college student now, and it's been weeks since the classes started. I'm anxious because my classmates seem to know a LOT more than what I expected. I have ZERO friends (I tried to socialize, but the vibe isn't there).

It gets so lonely at lunch. I don't know how it'll pan out for me for the next 3 years of college. I can't even cry because I feel so ungrateful for the equipment and support my parents are giving me. I often feel like this is not my life to live in. Like, someone out there deserves this life more than me.

I guess I hate myself somehow for not excelling in academics. I need someone, but I don't know who I need.",3,1146,150
"Yeah, lately, I think life has been going pretty good in terms of, like, oh, I got started pretty well. And so, it\'s been pretty easy for me to just get down to work. I\'ve been sleeping early and waking up early. And just been good, right? Well, for the past few days, and then today, I went out to the furniture store for one of my classes to take pictures for a model, a chair. It kind of branches off, right? So the professor recommended that you go with friends or classmates. He said, ""Take a friend with you."" I didn\'t take a friend because I like friends here. That just ain\'t good. Yeah, my friends aren\'t really on campus. They don\'t go here. I don\'t exactly have friends on campus. I just have people that I know, acquaintances. Anyways, so I went over to the furniture store, and the people there were super kind. I was like, ""Oh, I\'m here for a class,"" and they were super helpful and super nice. And I was kind of nervous about that because I was like, ""Oh, what if they see me as going to a furniture store and start measuring things and not actually buy anything or anything like that?"" But they were like, ""Oh, you\'re here for a class, and all the Gandhi,"" and they were like, ""Are you from my school?"" And I was like, ""Yeah,"" and they were like, ""Oh, for the chair class,"" and I was like, ""Oh, so you guys, oh,"" and it was like, ""Yeah."" It was like a decent conversation, and they were just super nice. So that was great. But yeah, then I came back. It was pretty hot outside, so I took a shower when I came back. And I had a whole plan for today, and it just didn\'t happen. I sat down and was like, ""I\'m going to take a break,"" and old habits die hard. I played Overwatch for how long, like, play Overwatch for like five or 6 hours, yeah, like 6 hours maybe. Played essentially until the dining hall is going to close, and as soon as I finish eating, I played some more. Got sick of it, so I\'m probably not going to play again for a while, right? Overall, it\'s just kind of like, ""Yeah, I\'m feeling disappointed in myself. I think. Makes sense why I did it. Usually I start gaming when I start feeling bad, but I don\'t know that I\'m feeling bad. Now when I realize, \'Oh, guess I was feeling bad about all this stuff about people.\' And yeah, here I am, just kind of saying, and talking. I wanted to talk for a bit because, well, I can only talk to my therapist once a week. And as for my best friend, she doesn\'t go here. To be honest, not a really good listener or empathizer for her. It\'s just kind of like, I already don\'t really share things a lot with the people I\'m around. I do share things with my therapist. That\'s about it. But the fact that she also doesn\'t really listen, the part of me that already isn\'t used to talking about things like this to other people is already like, \'No.\' And then add that on, it\'s just kind of like double now, right? It\'s just kind of like, I can\'t talk to my brother or my mom. They don\'t understand. They\'re like, \'Oh, you go to this great school.\' And that just never leaves their subconscious. And I can\'t really tell my family. They don\'t understand. It\'s always the, \'You should be grateful. You\'re a genius. You\'re so smart. Do your best. You\'re great.\' And then that\'s for my therapist. Like, yeah, she\'s great. Get to talk to her once per week, but usually by the time it gets around to a week, most things happen for some reason between sessions. So by the time I talk to her, I\'ve probably already kind of gotten over any emotions that I might have had. And at least with her, I talked with her don\'t really seem to evoke that much emotion either. I wonder if I should switch. Probably should. Yeah, essentially, for me, sometimes I offload by journaling. Maybe I should get in a habit of talking to myself. Or something like that evokes emotion. Emotion that I\'m not really aware of or used to being aware of. Yeah, I\'m sure like before I started gaming, I already felt pretty awful. I just didn\'t know. Play a game, opening that thing up, and it\'s just like, everything\'s so simple in games. It can be hard. But there\'s just something nice about my alone time. Since I played so much of it, I\'m sick of it. It\'s just like, yeah, I had a whole plan for today. I\'ve been very excited about school. Here I am now. I don\'t really have anyone to talk to. And the people that I\'ve met here on campus, I don\'t really have anyone to talk to. I really don\'t with anyone who is up here, I would say. They\'re not friends. They\'re all acquaintances. So, like, you know, the people who probably could understand. Although they also don\'t, at least the people who understand what it\'s like to go to a really prestigious school, who would just write me off, right? That\'s the thing. I try to talk to anyone who doesn\'t go to the school or like some prestigious school, it\'s like they think, like, \'Oh my God.\' There\'s a subconscious thing that dismisses me, my problems. And the people who are here who might understand, it\'s just like, these people are just going through totally different things and also they\'re not my friends. And then with the few times that I\'ve talked with alumni, people who aren\'t here anymore at the school, it\'s always like, they\'re always like, \'You should talk to your friends about this.\' It\'s like, \'Oh, I guess if I did have something, I guess I wouldn\'t be talking about some of these things that I\'m talking about, right? I don\'t know. All of these things added up together. It makes sense. I guess now, right? Like why I would be gaming for 6 hours like that. I didn\'t even have a clue that this was something that was like in my subconscious when I started gaming, right? Honestly, it was just kind of like, \'Hey, this stuff makes me feel fine. Like I\'m having fun. Let\'s do some more.\' I was really sorry to feel sick after so many hours of playing. And I was like, \'Okay, I need to go to bed.\' But also, I\'m going to have a not so fun time sleeping. I can usually go to sleep very easily, right? But ever since school started, I was getting bombarded by all these assignments and all these thoughts about people. Right? It\'s been on my mind. We\'re still not at the point where we\'re struggling to sleep yet, but it\'s been on my mind. So I was like, \'Okay, I should go to bed. But at this rate, kind of how like I\'m bad, I was feeling.\' Didn\'t really know why at the time, I was like, \'Okay. Sit down. Maybe Journal, or maybe talk it out.\' And that\'s why I\'m here. Like release some of that negative energy. Well, here I am. It\'s kind of funny, right? It\'s a Saturday evening and I\'m not going to do a robot. Not that I\'m complaining, but feel like most people have plans on this Saturday evening when they\'re in college. For me, it\'s just always been me and the best friend that I have. He became best friends online to our interactions online and not through our interactions in person. Yeah, anyways, that was a long-winded point of the story is I had stuff I wanted to do today. Went to the furniture store, got that part of my day done. Got super tired and decided to game for the rest of the day, even though I wanted to do work and other stuff instead, and I felt bad about it. And now I realize it\'s the reason why I gamed for so long is probably because I\'ve been feeling bad about people.","I'm at the point in the semester where every class is building in both intensity and workload, while I am simultaneously falling farther and farther behind, both in workload and in sleep. Whether it's lectures, problem sets, or readings, I feel like I'm constantly 3 steps behind where I should be, and because of that, I just feel like a failure, and imposter syndrome hits like a truck. It always hits like a truck.

Except despite all of this, I still don't think I'd rather be anywhere else. We can all joke about wanting to drop out and run away from everything, but at the end of the day, I think we all love it here. It's a community of both intense difficulty and pain, but also of immense supportiveness and success. We build each other up. That's why I love it here.

Sure, sometimes it's 3:00 am the night before a problem set is due, and ""I hate this f***ing place"" is the only thing on my mind. But the next day, when it's sunny out and I turn in the problem set and I get to hang out with my friends and forget even just for a moment about the hard work behind and ahead? That's when I can also say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I Have Truly Found Paradise.",3,1735,269
"so, for the car, I was trying to decide between the Prius and the Corolla. But as you said, the fuel efficiency and the miles per gallon of electric vehicles and hybrids are really nice. So I was thinking about that a lot over the last month or so. And then I learned at the dealership that I went to a few dealerships, and I learned that the shortage of microcontrollers and parts for cars is still pretty backed up, so a lot of the cars that you see on the parking lot at a dealership aren't actually available. And so we got really lucky because one of the dealerships we went to finally happened to have a Prius that day that was in good condition. And so decided to just go ahead and make an offer on that one. And eventually we got it.","I've always been a maker of sorts. And it wasn't until 2006, there was this night and weekend project with my good friend and colleague Alec, where he had seen this little coffee can that had a small battery-powered fan on the bottom of it that you'd stuff wood in. And by virtue of this fan pushing a little bit of extra air into the fire, the wood would burn. And what we learned was that half of the planet is still cooking on open fires and that the smoke from those fires kills 4 million people every year.

And it was at that point that we decided to make a company out of BioLite. We did our first venture pitch in 2009, and we were totally shot down, almost laughed out of the room. But the things they laughed at were the things they should've laughed at. We really didn't understand what it was gonna take for us to be successful.

So, I think persistence is obviously important, but I also think that you need to balance that with challenging yourself about whether you're hearing what needs to be heard.",3,158,214
"I joined the company. The company I joined is called Symbolic. They do warehouse automation. And I'm part of the team that's thinking about how to pack and unpack boxes. And so, while that on its own doesn't sound very interesting, it's very cool because it's related to my PhD topic in soft manipulation. And so, the open question of how do we develop a robot manipulator that can handle a wide variety of objects, including household objects, is quite an open question still. And so, this is a fantastic context in which to apply some of those techniques and background.","Engineering was exciting to me because it was the creation process of going from an idea to ""I've made this"" or ""this is a better way of doing it.""

We opened up the directory of industrial designers and we just started cold calling down the list to try to get interviews. We had just graduated from college so we didn't really know anything about their daily work, so we just asked them to tell us: ""So what do you do, show us where you work? What kind of projects are you working on? What are the problems?""

And one of the patterns was, people had a hard time finding new materials. Finding suppliers, finding how to use it, finding what the options are. It's a whole can of worms that they just didn't know how to do.

I really wanted to realize my maximum potential and I felt if I just took a job somewhere, then I wouldn't be able to realize it. It would just be whatever they gave you to do.

Today, if you want to build something, the barriers to try are very low. And it really comes back to effort and desire.",3,119,228
"So, my story for today is that with some of my friends from the Boston community, we formed a volleyball group. Coming up, that's going to be playing in a local tournament. And we've been planning out some strategies and who's playing what position, and all of those are in the works. We're going to try and practice at some point this week, but then our games start next week. And so, I'm looking forward to playing these games and having a more structured opportunity for more structured competition than our normal pickup games.","Today is the day of the competition. We were so excited but apprehensive about this trip. Ben has been preparing for several months, but are you ever really prepared? I could not sleep last night because I was so worried about this event, and I hoped I was able to support Ben accordingly.

How would I react if things don't go to plan? We have spent so much money and time on this. We got there around 6 am; traffic was shockingly less than expected! The parking lot was full already, but we managed to grab a space thanks to someone leaving. We remembered to take everything along we needed: costume, skates, snacks.

Tony, my husband, was exhausted and suffering from a cold. My older son, S, was not thrilled about attending this event and wanted to go home. I was hoping I could bribe him to enjoy things by saying he could pick where we ate dinner. Ben was excited and not even remotely nervous. I was a wreck but pretending to be fine!

Ben got into costume around 7 am, practice ice went well, and he seemed happy and content. We then saw the kids he would be competing against and felt a pang of nerves: how could this little kid compete against kids much bigger and stronger than him?! He did not seem fazed at all.

Another boy and his family were there, but they were not remotely friendly; they kept glaring at us, which made me feel irritated and also nervous. One of Ben's friends, a little girl skated and did ok but did not win; she came 4th in her event. This made me worry for Ben and start telling myself this whole trip was a waste of money.

It was time for Ben to skate, and we all held our breath; he did an amazing job, and we were not sure if it was good enough to win, but it was good. Ben's coach said, ""he has got this, he will win,"" and we waited for the scores, trying to not get too excited. The scores took forever to be announced, but when they were, sure enough, he had won!

It was time to calm down and congratulate the other skaters on their skates and try to not appear too boastful. We waited for the medal ceremony but heard nothing. We then had the medal ceremony, which was incredibly rewarding, and then the event was over!

We were exhausted and went home, and it was still only 10:30 am!",3,110,491
"Okay. So recently, I was reading a book called ""What Everybody Is Saying."" That\'s a very interesting commentary from this ex-CIA, I think, investigator who strongly stands by using reading cues from people with body language to be able to deduce things during conversation. And I first heard about the book a long time ago, but didn\'t get around to reading it until recently. And I remember what first caught my attention was that being able to understand body language is something that is very common throughout everyday life. But as I was reading the book this time around, I felt that a lot of the, I guess, a lot of the hints and observations that he was making were very, very subjective. And so, the book, while interesting, felt more like more of a pseudoscience to me.","We took a really cool course that invited people who weren't engineers, but who wanted to do some sort of science change. It was an art science class that said, ""It's all about combining the beauty of art and the analytical power of science to do something,"" so you just had to come in and have an idea and then find a way to combine those two to come up with a solution. So, we just locked ourselves up and brainstormed. And this is what we presented. And thankfully, being at somewhere like Harvard, there were a lot of resources that were made available to us. So, from the class, we got a small grant to keep on playing around with the idea. 

And for a while, it was just kind of trying to understand what is this ball. Engineers didn't believe it could work. So we actually had to research how it would work: research the Faraday Principle. Then build their own conceptual model, test it in South Africa, and then have engineers say, ""Okay."" 

For us, it was really interesting because people always say, ""How do you think out of the box?"" And I'm like, ""It's really easy to think out of the box when you don't even know the parameters of the box."" If you don't even know that a box exists, whereas knowledge is power. Sometimes, with knowledge, it's very easy to see the obstacles. And we were just like, ""Why wouldn't it work?"" 

Even though we did not necessarily have the technical expertise, we certainly knew the context.",3,159,319
"Okay. So, I was looking through my old pictures, and I came across some of the ones from when I spent a year in Switzerland, in between undergrad and grad school. And I look back fondly on that experience because it was the first time I really lived away from home, further than College, but also living in another country. And it was a very good, growing experience.","I recently went to my best friend's wedding in Spain. This was about 4 months ago and was in the south of Spain, a part of Spain I had never been to before. Before the trip, I was extremely busy and had very limited time to actually plan the trip. Therefore, I had fairly low expectations about it and didn't think too much about it until it actually happened.

I had been to Spain fairly often before (mostly the North), and therefore thought that the South was very similar to it culturally. However, once I arrived in Ubeda, the little village where my friend's wedding was taking place, I realized I had been all wrong. The streets were narrow, the town was full of culture and beautiful monuments due to its rich history and culture, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The trip made a strong impression on me and made me fall in love with the town.

People were friendly, the food was delicious. Over there, people have jamon with bread, tomatoes, and olive oil for breakfast. Initially, it seemed strange to me, but by the third day, it seemed so natural to me, and I feel like I had lived there my whole life. My best friend's family was warm and lovely as well. I quickly realized that it was a defining personality trait of people from the south of Spain.

Towards the end of my week-long trip, I began dreading my departure from the city and tried to take as many mental pictures of the trip as I could, so I would never forget it. Specifically, the wedding cathedral, the endless olive oil fields, the jamon available at every restaurant in town, the beautiful weather, and the friendliness of the people.

Since I have been back, I have already begun planning my trip back, as well as learning Spanish, and this trip had a strong unexpected impact on my life.",3,78,373
"Okay. So prior to moving back to Boston recently, I spent some time in Asia going to a few places including Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand. No, Indonesia, Indonesia. But what I wanted to talk about today was the visiting my extended family in Taiwan and that experience.","A few months ago, we took a vacation back to my home with my son. It was scary because it was my son's first time flying, and I was pretty stressed out about it. It was the first time I had been back home in years, and the first time for most of my family to meet my son, who was one and a half at the time.

The flight went better than expected, and we eventually landed, rented a car, got through customs, and drove to visit family. We spent a lot of time with my mother, who had recently moved into an apartment and was living on her own for the first time in her life. My father passed away three years ago, and previously she had been living with my younger sister. But she decided everyone needed their own space and moved out.

We got to see all my cousins and aunts and uncles, and my son got to meet his cousins for the first time. My husband also got to meet many of my family members he had never met before too.

We had time to see my best friend in the world, who I do not get to see enough. We visited my old childhood home to see how it looked, drove past my high school and grade school, and toured around all the places that had meaning to me growing up.

My mother was so happy to spend time with her grandson. Of course, she spoiled him with toys and presents. To be able to share this with my son and my husband was pretty amazing.

We live so far from where I am from. It was really great to be back with them.",5,61,322
"Okay. So, unrelated to art, but last night I was going back to my car in the parking lot of A Whole Foods. As I was walking back, right as I was walking up to my car, the lady who was pulling in next to me rammed into it by accident. And I felt very frustrated because as I was dealing with that today because it's like relatively minor. No one was hurt fortunately, but still have to invest a lot of time and energy to go get everything resolved, including stopping by the Police Department this morning and also having to call the lady as well as my car insurance several times. So all in all, an unfortunate circumstance but tough day dealing with it.","About three months ago, I was involved in a very serious car wreck. I was on my way home from work when a large white truck hit me from the side at an intersection. The truck ran a red light because they were falling asleep at the wheel. I never even saw the truck coming, so I was surprised when I was struck. It was around 6:30 am when this happened, so the roads were pretty empty at first. I remember hearing the crash but not really seeing it and then kind of just realizing I was hit.

When I gathered myself, I started to get out of the car and notice two people walking towards me, asking if I was doing okay. It turns out one of the people that I was talking to was the person that hit me, and they seemed very scared and apologetic. It took maybe about 10 minutes for the police to arrive and take our statements and make a report for us. My car had to be towed off the scene.

I would later find out that it was a total loss. I was a little upset though to see there was little to no damage to the truck that hit me. Luckily, I wasn't too far from home, so I ended up just walking the rest of the way there.

On the way home, I still felt a little shaken up and even almost nervous as if I was in trouble. The whole event was a bit scary to me since I had never been in a car accident before, but I was just happy to be safe. I now own a truck for the safety features it has because my little car didn't stand a chance. I now also notice that I drive slower through intersections without even thinking about it.",3,140,339
"So, the story that I want to share is related to, also related to the wedding, but just being in San Diego. And so, while I was there, I had a few extra days to visit and sightsee and see some of the old places from school.\n\nAnd so, one of the fun activities was, now some of my friends are still in the area working or finishing up grad school. And then, another one of my friends just started as a professor at UCSD, and so it was really fun catching up with all these people.\n\nAnd, it makes me appreciate the openness and willingness of people to take time out of their busy schedules to maintain these relationships and how much that means to me.","My husband and I celebrated our third wedding anniversary. It is emotional for me because we've been together for eleven years, so celebrating an anniversary with someone I love so much makes me happy. A lot of people don't last in relationships, and to have a long-lasting relationship and a great one makes me very happy. 

My husband surprised me on our anniversary by taking me to the resort that we got married at. It was a very special seafood dinner buffet. It was fancy, and when we go out to eat, we usually don't eat out at places so fancy, so it was very special. 

I have cherished the time I spent with my husband. We have gone on lots of fun trips together. We have moved cross country twice. My relationship is a very memorable part of my life. It feels very special to get to spend my life with someone. 

The most memorable part of this year as well is that my English Bulldog celebrated one year of not having aspiration pneumonia. She was very sick a year ago and almost died. She is very important to me and my husband. She makes us both very happy and adds to the joy of our relationship.",3,138,231
"So this past weekend, Alicia and I went up to the near the White Mountains area, so Lakes Sunipe, I think it's called. And the reason we went up was to go see the leaves changing colors. And as we drove further and further North, the leaves became more and more colorful. It was a really pleasant experience taking a road trip.","My family and I just came back from a camping trip yesterday. I wanted to do one last mini vacation before my child started school today. It was a great 3-day weekend. On Friday, my family and I left for our camping trip to Perris Lake in Perris, California. Perris is 2 hours away from us, so we actually went and stayed with a friend on Friday that lived one hour away from the lake.

On Saturday was the start of our camping trip. It was hot, 105 plus degree temperatures every day, trust me I will never forget that. Good thing the lake was not too far from the campsite. We went with 5 of our friends. The best thing was my child got to see one of her friends that she had not seen over a year because they moved four hours away. I had a great time. The lake was nice and refreshing. We had a couple of canoes with us, so we went out exploring the lake. We had great food from the grill and fresh fruits to keep us fresh because of the heat.

The last night, on Sunday, there was a storm off in the distance. We had a great lightning storm and a little wind. Luckily, it did not rain. I know now not to go camping here in the late summer because the heat was too much for me. I had mixed feelings from this camping trip because I was happy to be around some great friends I had not seen in a while, but the heat was awful.",3,71,296
"My cat, Katie, has disappeared. I live at home in Ohio. I'm just here in Massachusetts temporarily, and my parents have been taking care of my two cats, Sammy and Katie. And about three days ago, Katie disappeared, and we can't find her anywhere. None of the neighbors know where she is. We've not seen any sign of her. I've been monitoring the camera, and I'm very afraid that something happened to her. They haven't been able to find her at the side of the road. It doesn't seem like she's been hit by a car, but I'm worried that a coyote might have gotten her. And I'm really worried about her. She's my sweet girl. I don't want anything bad to have happened to her.","We've had 5 cats at once, then a single one up until 6 months ago when we got a Sphynx. The black one passed, and we were OK with the Sphynx. Only, it attacked my daughter's pet Conure, who is practically an emotional service animal for her. The bird came out fine, but we decided to rehome the cat, and today was the day.

She's gone to a great home, but we miss her greatly, and so does our Poodle. It'll take some getting used to, but it will be nice to not have to clean a litter box.

She actually slept in the crook of my arm this morning. She's never done that.",4,158,136
"I thought that I was going to marry the man that I had been dating. We were together for about two weeks shy of five years. And I thought he was my forever partner. But he wasn't very supportive of me coming to Harvard, even though it was only supposed to be for a year. He wasn't happy for me. And me being here was really hard on him. And I don't think that I was as attentive a partner as I should have been in retrospect. And it ultimately led to us breaking up right after I graduated. At the same time, I got some really tough medical news. And so it's just been a lot to grapple with.","My boyfriend of over 2 years broke up with me a few weeks ago. I won't get into it, but he is in a bad situation that is preventing us from really being together. I would do anything for him and anything to be with him. He has decided that he doesn't want to hold me hostage, preventing me from meeting someone else that can love me the way I deserve.

There was nothing I could say or do to get him to change his mind. I'm very hurt and feel dead inside. I feel really safe with him, and this is the first healthy relationship I have ever been in. He has inspired me to be the successful person I am today. I have been working as much as possible because that's what I do when I need to go numb.

We are still friends, hanging out, hooking up. Almost like we are still together, but we are not. I'm confused. We love each other very much, but we aren't together anymore. I worry that he is going to start hooking up with other people. He has been working out, which he would never do while we were together or with me.

I'm turning 40 this year. I just don't know if I can meet someone else. I'm single, have no kids, and no one has ever wanted to be with me that isn't using me, besides my ex. I just can't believe I'm not his girlfriend anymore.",3,136,291
"Yesterday was my daughter Melinda's birthday, and she was 37 years old. It's hard to imagine that she's 37 years old now, 37 in one day. So, I was thinking a lot about the day she was born. I had hoped to have a vaginal delivery, and I had a room all picked out where you could stay in the same room in the hospital for both labor, delivery, and then after delivery. But it turned out that I didn't go into labor, just my water broke, and it was two weeks early, so I needed a C-section. So, I had a second C-section.","On May 27, my wife gave birth to our first child, a beautiful baby daughter. We instantly loved her more than anything in the world. The entire experience was more emotionally moving than I anticipated. It started with a very long labor for my wife, who initially tried to go through labor without relief from drugs. And during this time, she needed me more than ever. I had to be strong physically and emotionally to help her cope. Eventually, she took the epidural, and the labor became more of a waiting game. 

But giving birth is every bit as complicated as it sounds, and we got to the point that it just wasn't progressing even with drugs given to speed up my wife's contractions. As a result, she had to have a C-section, a devastating result for her, and I once again had to be stronger than I actually am and do my part to calm her down. 

Once that beautiful baby was born, nothing else mattered. She looked healthy and seemed to instantly bond with us. I was scared for my wife who just went through a pretty serious surgery and at the same time wanted to give my full self to the little helpless human being. 

Having family at the hospital was really a blessing, all so anxious to help and to see our little creation. It also helped that the doctors and nurses were every bit as smart and helpful as we could have asked for. The details of that day are permanently engraved in my mind. 

The following days, which involved almost no sleep and horrible hospital food, are days that I wouldn't give up for anything. Having the nurses there for support and questions was something we never wanted to give up.",4,124,331
"When I was a little girl, when I was a little girl for Easter, we would go to my grandmother's house, grandmother and grandfather's house. They lived only a couple of miles from us, but they weren't really very child-oriented. And the one time they didn't invite us over was at Easter. Flash. We would go over more than that, but that was a time when also my cousins would come. My father was a twin. And so, his twin had a daughter just my age and a son just my brother's age. And then my father's older brother was only, I think, 13 months older than him. So they had had, my grandmother had three little boys, very close together. They lived in a house that they had built, pretty much built themselves. My father helped build it. It was on the top of a Hill in Andersonville, Tennessee, in front of a river and behind the road that went through town. Whenever we drove by it, my father would honk twice so that they would know that one of their sons had passed by the house. When I went to see my grandmother, we would be allowed to use the bathroom in the basement, which was actually just a commode out in the middle of the room, and there was a huge big coal pile, which we weren't supposed to play in. So when we did play in it, which of course we did, we always tried to be careful. However, the coal dust always gave us away and it was a fun time. I especially liked it when I got to see my cousins because since I lived out in the country, I wasn't around children too much except for my own siblings.","It all started this summer for my family reunion. The Ricardo Family Reunion was to be held as a 2-day event, starting on Saturday, June 20th, and Sunday, June 21st. It was a lovely day. On Saturday, we held a family picnic at the Pavilion. We played baseball, basketball, volleyball, and the kids had a water slide. We had a large selection of food. We traced our family generation back as far as 9 generations. We learned so much about where we came from and how strong of a family line we have.

The children enjoyed themselves, playing with cousins they and Aunts and Uncles that just met or haven't seen in a long time. My great-great-great grandfather was an Indian Chief. We learned that we belong to the Cherokee Indians. My family is mixed with Spanish and French. We listened to stories told by the elders about events that had happened in their days.

We were told stories about how the family stayed and worked together. We talked about the many fishing boats that the family had on Grand Isles. We also visited Madewood plantation where my Grandfather, Mr. Ricardo, had done a lot of work in restoring the plantation. We even went to New Orleans and toured the city. We visited where my grandfather, Mr. Ricardo, had done some work in the French Quarter.

The next day, we all celebrated by going to Mass together. Being with family is a blessing, and sometimes we let the world and material things get in our way and make us forget about what is important. The best time is spending it with family, united in love and doing the simple things in life.",5,343,320
"My husband and I got married when we were both very young. We were halfway through college. We had met right before we started college. He had a football scholarship, and I thought that money was dumb. So I really wasn't very interested in him. But we had a mutual friend who introduced us, and he thought I was going to be a snob. He thought, after he met me, that I had a boyfriend already because there was another guy from Rice who was at the same church camp that we went to. \nBut we quickly connected when we got to college and were engaged two years later, or got married two years later, halfway through school. If either one of my daughters had wanted to get married at that young age, I was not quite 20, and he was just past 20, I would have been horrified. But I think we grew together. Our wedding was a small wedding in Littlefield, which was the town where I lived. My mother wanted to do the reception at our house, so we did the reception at our house. And we had lots of friends that came for the wedding, so we got to see friends and show them my hometown. I remember being upset that I wanted to go swimming with everybody the day of the wedding, and my mother wouldn't let me because she said I would mess up my hair, which it was true. I would have, and I might have gotten sunburned. So she was probably right. \nThe night of our wedding, we drove to New Mexico. We were both poor, halfway through college, so poor college students. We had borrowed my brother's tent, which was a pup tent with no floor and not quite long as Fred so his feet stuck out, and we had to just put sleeping bags down on the ground. \nPretty soon after we got to Houston, back to school, we took our wedding money, which, if I'm not mistaken, was something like $60, and bought a $45 tent, which we used over and over again, and a $15 ice cream maker. We really thought we were flush to buy those things.","My soon-to-be sister-in-law's wedding. It was in one of my favorite towns, Gainesville. We each had our own little cottages on the property, so I didn't feel rushed or even worried about getting ready on time since we woke up there.

It was the first wedding I had ever been to as an adult and also felt super close to the people getting married. The morning was great. I stayed with the boys for the most part since I knew them a bit better than the bridesmaids. We were all swapping stories and kidding around while I helped them get ready. My boyfriend looks amazing in his tux, and it actually made me cry because I had never seen him dressed up like that. It honestly made me feel like I couldn't wait to get married for the first time ever in my life.

I sat in the front and helped my boyfriend's grandparents since they are a bit older and have a hard time getting up and down. The bride and groom looked so amazing. They had been together for 8 years, so this was a really big deal to everyone. The ceremony went off without a hitch.

Afterwards, it was just a lot of fun. The meal was buffet style, and I was sitting with my boyfriend, his parents, and his grandparents. I helped his grandparents get food, and again, everyone swapped stories. I was so happy to be part of his family and part of this event, and I felt really included.

At the end, we all got Star Wars lightsabers, and we made an archway using them for the bride and groom to walk through. After that, my boyfriend and I spent the rest of the night playing with the little kids who waited the whole day to play with them. We ended up getting beat up like crazy.

I loved the day, and I wouldn't change it for anything.",5,426,365
"So, when I was a little girl, I was born in Memphis, Tennessee. But then my father, who was a dentist, went to a special public health program in Atlanta. But then we moved back to the family home, town of Andersonville, Tennessee. And while our house was being built, we lived in the house in front that was probably 150 years old when we were living there. My great aunt lived in it. It was a two-story house. We had the top story. And I remember having a baby bed and watching the lights of the cars on the highway in front of the house coming by. It wasn't a very busy road, so it wouldn't happen very often, but I would see them come and move all the way across the room from one side to another. That's my earliest memory, those lights. When the house is finished, we moved into our own house, but I still loved to go up to the upper story, and I kept some toys up there at my great aunt's house. The families, our families, would put apples from the apple trees down on newspapers in one of the bedrooms. And one of my jobs was to go up and look for bad spots and turn over all the apples and look for bad spots and throw away blends with bad spots. Actually, if they had a lot of good on them, I would bring them downstairs and my grand aunt would make applesauce out of them or apple pies. I liked playing in the other room, and eventually, we had a bed in there when my parents got a new bed, bedroom set for our house. They put their old bedroom set in one of the bedrooms upstairs. And in the summertime, I liked to go up there and sleep. I had to share a bedroom with my little sister, and a way for me to have a room of my own was to leave our family house and go to the house next door. My aunt also liked it because she didn't like to be alone. And I remember that every summer I would look forward to moving out of our house and moving all of our stuff up to the house. I'm not sure my mother liked it very much, but she didn't mind since I was company for my great aunt. I found out only later, and it was so strange that I never noticed it while I was semi-living there, that there was one room that was never finished out. You can see the window from downstairs, and it had a curtain on it, window shades. But there was no door going into it, so the house didn't fit the door. And that was kind of a mystery. That makes a good Halloween story, I think, since nobody ever knew what was in that room. Fred, after we were married, tried to get a ladder and look through the window, but the curtains were pulled so they couldn't really see very much. So we still don't know what was in it. One of my friends bought the house after we moved from Tennessee, and they completely redid it. So I avoided asking when we went back what was in the top.","My music taste has definitely changed as I grew up, but there are a few songs that always invoke feelings of nostalgia when time was much more peaceful and enjoyable. One of these songs is called ""Bubbly"" by Colbie Caillat, and I heard it playing today at Trader Joe's while I was buying some groceries. It was such a weird and nostalgic experience, and I stuck around even after I paid to listen to the full thing play out.

I remember being in kindergarten where we had a designated ""nap time"" and the teacher would always play this song softly in the background. I remember being picked up by mom and going to get a snack after school with this song playing on the radio.

It was so weird realizing that all of this happened and is a part of me, and I know that sounds really dumb, but it's just grounding to notice how far I've come with everything. I'm now in college away from that easygoing life of a little kindergartner, where all I had to worry about was what outdoor game me and my friends would play or what fun things I would do with my family over the weekend.

It's just crazy to me how times change, but at the end of it all, I'm still me. It's even more crazy to me how just a simple 3-minute song made me have so many thoughts at the same time.",4,629,271
"This isn't really a story about one of my travels, but I was thinking I would like to talk about collections today when I was a little girl. We lived in Tennessee. My father had been a botany major at the University of Tennessee before he went to dental school. And in the fifth grade, we had to make all kinds of collections. We had to make a mineral collection. And my father helped me with that. He went to a friend of his who was a geologist and got a bunch of samples of things. It wasn't really much work on my part because the geologist just gave me the bunch of samples, and I put them in a box and turned it in, but I got a really good grade on it because there were a lot of them.\n\nAnd then the next thing we had to make a collection of was leaves. And I decided that one I was really going to do by myself with help, but not like I had done the minerals. So we were required to have 20 leaves, and I ended up having over 100 leaves. One of the most memorable was going to the University of Tennessee campus, where there was a ginkgo tree; echos didn't grow anywhere else in our area of Tennessee. And we got the leaves from that. As you can imagine, in East Tennessee, there were many, many kinds of trees, so it wasn't hard at all to come up with 100. And I also got a good grade on that.\n\nFunnily enough, when we moved to Texas and I got to high school and was in high school biology, they also required collections. And I'd saved my mineral collection and my leaf collection because one, because it was pretty, and the other because I'd worked so hard on it. So what I did as a sophomore in high school was just basically take out the exact same things I'd used and put them in a new presentation format and turn them in. And I also got A's on both collections. That time, we also had to make an insect collection. And I had fun doing that because I like insects. And I collected maybe 50 or 60. My method of collecting insects was to capture them in a jar and stick them in the freezer until they were frozen. And I thought that killed them. Well, it turns out that freezing does not kill all insects because in the middle of the night, I had used the desk in my little brother's room to put my final Styrofoam board with the pins through the insects. And in the middle of the night, he started yelling, and we get running in there. And many of the insects had revived and were hopping around the room. The grasshoppers came loose with their pins. They were hopping around. The wasps were flying around. So I learned the hard way that freezing is not a good way to kill bugs.","I started out as a chemistry major at the University of Washington, and I didn't do very well in chemistry. It was really tough. I went to my advisor, and he said, ""Well, of course you're not doing very well. You know, women do not belong in chemistry."" And I was a freshman, so I said, ""Oh, okay.""

I went and changed my major, and I ended up as a biologist, but I think that what got me through is I really, really did want to be a scientist. I just had to tough it out because in the end, there isn't anything that anyone does that doesn't have its challenges, or its hard days, or its really difficult times.

You have to figure out what it is that you wanna spend most of your time on so that most of your time, there's something that really is rewarding going on. That gets you through the hard times.",5,567,192
"So, when our girls were in high school, we took a trip to Costa Rica. And the girls, I think they were both in high school. Although Melinda may have been in junior high school, and Susanna, a freshman in high school. I think that is what it was. So I planned the trip, and I planned it all online. There wasn't any Expedia back then, I don't think, and a whole lot of things that would make it easier now. We didn't have then, but I used a travel agency out of Chicago, strangely enough because they had some good trips in Costa Rica. So we flew into Costa Rica, and then went to Arenal, and then we went over to the Pacific Coast and stayed in a beautiful Airbnb zone. Arenal was so rainy and humid that everything in our suitcases was drenched. You could even wring them out after the end of the time, even though they hadn't been out in the rain. And when we got to the Pacific Coast, we had an Airbnb. We had a separate room for the girls, and for us, they overlooked the ocean. It had a beautiful swimming pool, and both girls were just as grumpy as could be about the whole thing because they missed their friends. Since then, they often talked about how wonderful the trip is and how they're ashamed of themselves from being teenagers. But I tell them I was worse when I was a teenager.","My wife and I went on a small, last-minute vacation to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. It was in April of this year. It was a very memorable trip for me. I love spending time with my wife, and when we can get away at the last minute, that just makes it that much more special.

Gatlinburg is where we spent our honeymoon, and it has special significance to us. This time was special because we just bonded so much more than we usually do. We got to do more things because the weather was warmer this time around. We got to stay close to downtown, so we took a lot of walks together to a lot of different places.

The most memorable part was sitting on a balcony at a restaurant overlooking the main road that goes through town. We spent hours there just talking and people-watching. I still think about that afternoon and how much fun we had together just being together and not really doing anything at all.

Besides that day, we had a couple of great meals at some neat places. We also went to try a new place out that was really bad, and yet we still made the most of it.

Overall, that trip was one of my most favorite times of my life. It was because I spent it with my favorite person I've ever met. We still talk about how we can't wait to go back, but I don't think any trip will compare to that one.",5,288,281
"Okay, so we are now on the third generation sent us. And my nephew Sam had dated several girls that we really didn\'t think too much of. Those seem to be like they just wanted him to buy them stuff. But lately, we met a few years ago, we met a woman that we really like. She was from Puerto Rico, and she was a switch therapist. And sure enough, she and Sam kept dating. And then the next thing we heard, they were moving in together and buying a house together. And now they had the most adorable little girl named Liliana. And a few minutes ago or about a couple of hours ago, I got a phone call from Sam. And he said, ""Do you mind if we stopped by? We need to have a place to change a diaper."" So they came by and Elia walked all around and took nuts and gave them to everybody in the house. She calls my husband TIO Upuelo, and she calls me TIA Apuela. And we think that this is a great couple. Unfortunately, they\'re not going to have a destination wedding in Puerto Rico, but they might have a party there.","I have been dating Michelle for nearly three years. In June, we went to Rome, Italy for a week-long vacation she had booked for us. It was a trip of a lifetime for me as I had rarely traveled anywhere outside of the United States. We left Dallas and flew to London for a 6-hour layover. It was long enough where we could leave the airport and experience a little of the area before flying on to Rome.

After a few days in Rome, touring all of the sites I had only read about, we had dinner at an extremely fancy restaurant. It was there that my life changed for the better. I was widowed about ten years ago, and I didn't think I would ever marry again. Much to my surprise, Michelle proposed to me. I know it isn't the traditional way this was supposed to work, but I was floored.

My heart and mind were racing that I don't even remember saying yes, but she said I accepted right away. The look on her face made me the happiest man in the world. I truly believe we were destined to be together, but it took me some nudging to make me realize it for real.

For the rest of the trip, I was walking on air. I have finally found happiness in my life again. I felt like the luckiest person on earth.",4,231,264
"Today, I want to tell about my experience as a medical student. When I went to medical school, I went back after being a nontraditional major of cultural anthropology. Then I applied to medical school and went to Texas Tech, which was in Lubbock. It was a fairly new medical school, and they didn\'t have the hospital built yet. So, for the third year, they shipped the entire class to El Paso, which was definitely high Spanish speaking, and it was there that I actually learned to speak Spanish because my patients also spoke Spanish. Even though I took it in class, I hadn\'t really used it. I\'ve been in the Peace Corps, and that really helped me with knowing how to learn a foreign language with joy, which is to go ahead and use it.\n\nIn my obstetrics rotation, we got to deliver a lot of babies. There were many women who came across the border from Mexico to have a baby because then the baby was an American citizen. So back then, that was a lot easier than it is now. We could walk across the bridge and have lunch and come back to do our afternoon\'s work. We went back and forth really easily. \n\nBut one night, the medical students were a couple of medical students were doing, working in, delivering, and we had had a very busy day with a lot of deliveries. Each one of us had gotten to deliver more than one baby. And a woman came in, and it was my friend Philip\'s turn to do the delivery. And so, he was taking off initial assessments. We played this game where we tried to guess the weight of the baby just by the physical exam. And we were pretty widespread in our guesses, but we were more accurate by just making a guess without even going and looking at the mom than we were in trying to assess, which told us a lot about that. \n\nSo this particular night, it was late at night, and the residents had opted off the bed, hoping to get some sleep when a woman came in. And she was having what we call a precipitous delivery, which means her labor had progressed so fast that she was delivered right on the stretcher in the labor room. So my friend Philip delivered the baby. He barely had time to get off gloves. He actually caught the first baby while putting on his gloves. Got the gloves up, and we were all teasing him, and his friend was teasing him about delivering babies without gloves when all of a sudden, the woman started to cry again, which amused us. She\'s about to deliver, and we thought, ""Oh, it\'s a Philip."" Went over, and what do you know? It was not one. It was a second baby. So she had twins. Fortunately, at that time, he still had his gloves on, so he caught the second baby. And we still had all of this happen so fast. We had sent somebody to go wake up the resident because we weren\'t supposed to do deliveries without a resident around. But we\'d already done good at that point in the night, two twins. And so the resident hadn\'t even come back yet because we had to get him up when the second baby was delivered.\n\nAnd so, we got the second baby out, cleaned it up, and we were all laughing and teasing about Philip delivering twins. He actually, at that point, wanted to go into obstetrics. So he ended up going into anesthesiology. And suddenly, the nurse came in with the labs from the woman that we had taken initially. We had said, ""This has some night, right? We all got to deliver babies, and Philip got delivered twins. What else could happen?"" Just at that moment, it was like they\'d been planned. And the nurse walked in and said, ""I have the labs at gs, syphilis."" The mom had syphilis, and the two babies had to be evaluated for syphilis. I think they turned out to both be okay. But we\'ve teased Philip forever about we were going to tell his girlfriend that he had gotten exposed to syphilis while he was in El Paso, away from her.","I bought a consumer-grade camera in 1989 and said to myself, ""One day I'm gonna make a documentary that makes a difference."" A friend of a friend came and said, ""Do you have a minute? Let's go out and get a drink. I want to talk to you.""

And he said, ""I was in the Russian Far East investigating the trade in Siberian tiger pelts, and they offered to sell me women. Let's do something about it."" He came to me because I had done international human rights work and I knew a lot about women's issues. It wasn't something I was familiar with in 1995.

So I started researching it and then just quit my job two weeks later. I pitched up his office and was like, ""Okay. I can wait tables if I need to in order to make this happen."" And I created a phony company called International Liaison Specializing in Foreign Models, Escorts, and Entertainers. We posed as foreign buyers interested in purchasing women.

"Related to the Indian restaurant, I guess I'll tell a story about my first experience with Mexican food. We live in Tennessee, where nobody ever had Mexican food. The foreign food that we had, which was Zena is very excited. Was pizza and also sometimes chow, Megan. But my aunt is from Texas and she went to Texas to visit and came back with some canned corn tortillas and some canned, I think, enchilada sauce. So, she invited us over. Up until that time, I was probably nine or ten, maybe ten. I really didn't like any kind of food. I liked hamburger and French fries and Pinto beans and pretty much that was it. But she made us Tex-Mex food, enchiladas, and tacos, and it was so delicious. I instantly converted to being a Mexican food lover. And also, that was the muller when I started eating other things besides my very limited diet.","I used to date a girl. I loved her. We had good times together. I miss the good times. There are things I don't miss. It's been years now. But tonight, I think of her because I want a pastrami sandwich.

We were helping a friend move to NYC. I'm well-traveled; she wasn't. At the time, we weren't wealthy people, but our friend's company was paying his moving expenses, and it was loose enough that we could bill in a fee that was equal to our bar tab for the evening. We had a grand time! Underground sushi. Rooftop tequila! A neat speakeasy! Nothing too crazy, but a royal night on the town!

Eventually, he tapped out, and she and I carried on. We played some pool at a Latin bar, and (finally) exhausted, we hit a bodega at around 4 am for a snack before slinking into our dude's house to crash on the floor before driving back to Ohio.

There is nothing special about pastrami on rye. Except that the subset of towns with really good pastrami, really good rye, and really good mustard is VERY small. I grew up in Cincinnati, which makes the best rye and decent mustard but can't make pastrami.

And maybe it's because we were drunk, or maybe it's because even a late-night bodega in Spanish Harlem has quality food, but this was a great sandwich. And I've had a few great sandwiches. Perfect pastrami, a good vinaigrette dressing, hot mustard. The veggies didn't stand out, but the lettuce was crisp, the onions sweet, and while the tomato didn't stand out, it also didn't mess up the whole thing.

A great sandwich, in great company, shared on the staircase of some ancient boarding house in the shadow of the George Washington Bridge. But tonight, I craved pastrami out of the blue.

I was drinking gin and grapefruit (a far stretch from the lemon-lime Jaritos we'd shared that night) and suddenly remembered that flavor. And with it, her.

I'm not sure I would trade my recent successes to be back with her on 173rd in the humid August air, broke, drunk, and happy. But I might. That may have been the happiest I've ever been. Certainly, I was happier than I am now.",4,182,461
"So, I've been working on my outdoor deck. It's in a home that my partner and I got about three years ago. And we are not super handy, but we've been trying to figure out how to make some of the repairs ourselves. And it so happened that the deck outside needs a new set of paint in the outer layer. And that's something we have been working on. It's interesting because we're getting to learn how to do the research online to understand the different materials, different adhesives, different companies that are out there, how to let it dry for the right amount of time, how to strip the existing paint, etc., etc.","I really love making people happy, and I love using power tools and stuff. So obviously, I was really happy when my flatmates asked me if I could drill some holes in their wall to fix a wardrobe that would otherwise fall over if the doors are open. They borrowed a drill, got some dowels and screws, and I got to screw around with some nice power tools. I feel honored that they trust me to do this. 

After the wardrobe was fixed to the wall, I went back to my little crafting table. All Christmas gifts this year will be handmade by me. I'm making a gift for a friend, and I spent some time cutting, sanding, gluing, and painting this little thing. Today, I pre-drew the outlines of the last bit I need to paint on both sides and finished painting one side. 

I can't wait for his reaction when I give it to him!",2,134,178
"Badminton. When I was in 11th and 12th grade, and I guess I clung to it like, what's the phrase? Like a fish takes to water. I started playing 6 hours a day, every day, and I became really good at it within a matter of a few months and started playing competitively. Eventually and so on. And then, because I had to go for my undergrad, I had to drop badminton and just focus on my curriculum and academics. It's only after a hiatus of, I would say, 14 years that I have picked up badminton again. And I've been playing very actively over the last three months, and it's been a lot of fun. Yeah.","No one thinks about bobsledding as a kid, especially around here, sunny southern California. You see it on TV during the Olympics, and that's it. It's just not something that you think about doing at a young age. 

When I came to UCLA, even by my fourth, fifth year, I was like, what am I gonna do? Track's almost over, I keep getting hurt throwing javelin, and it's just like, what next? That's when my coach encouraged me to try out for bobsledding. Never been in a sled before, never been on ice before, but you have to realize what can I do now that I'll not be able to do later on? 

You can't go back and bobsled in ten years, you have to do it now. This is the only time you can do it. So I was like, I gotta go do this, I gotta try it now or else I'll never know. And that ultimately led to Korea for the Winter Olympic Games. 

So for me, my goal has always been the same, to make the Olympics. I just didn't realize it would be in bobsledding, but here I am.",2,139,237
"When I was back in undergrad, I was in my first year living in a dormitory for the first time. My roommate did not show up on the first day that I started living in the dorms, nor the second day. But suddenly, when I came back from shopping on the third day, he was standing there in the room. And as I walked in, we looked at each other, we sized each other up. And he was like, you know what, this will do. And what I mean by that is, when you meet someone, I think there's energy, there's a vibe they give out. And it was very interesting to see my roommate, and the moment I saw him, to know that I was like, this guy and I are going to get along very well. And we did. We made it through the next six years throughout undergrad in Glasgow. And to me, that is remarkable.","I have been in a relationship for a few years. My boyfriend is a wonderful man, and not only have I never had a crush, but never noticed any other men when I was in a relationship. This is a first for me, and of all people, it's my lecturer at college. This man must be twice my age and certainly has no interest in me, but I literally get nauseous before class because I'm so overwhelmed with feelings.

It's the whole shebang—pounding heart, nervousness, butterflies, and I think about him. All. Day. Long. I don't think I can even talk to anyone about it because people would just think I was one of those weird girls who hits on all her professors, but I swear I'm not.

There's just something so attractive and alluring about him, and he's so corny, but it's adorable. I feel like I don't even know myself right now. I've never even been attracted to people I could date like this, and now I'm like head over heels for someone way out of my age range, who I could never even be with.",2,186,224
"So my friends were participating in the Kindergarten Five K last weekend, and they roped me into it. I used to be a runner back in school, but haven\'t done it in 15 or 16 years. And when they asked if I wanted to join, I said, ""Yeah, let\'s give it a try."" I would love to be able to train, but it looked like every weekend between when I registered and when the race was raining. And so, at the end of the day, we decided to just do a couch to five K, which is get into the actual race without doing any training. It felt a little intimidating, but it seemed as though it would be an interesting experience in itself, without the intent to win or get a super fascinating timing. But before the race, I did a lot of research around how to practice, what the mindset should be, how I should pace myself, etc. And consistently, and most importantly, the advice I got was, ""Know what your average pace is and go just a little bit below that."" And it turned out to be a good race overall. I got a good timing, it was enjoyable enough, and the fact my friends were celebrating made it a lot of fun overall.","I started getting really tired of the daily grind, the nine to five. I'm not really sure what it was. I just started losing traction, and I needed some big goal to motivate me. I needed something to happen.

And I started thinking about the Vendee Globe, which is the non-stop around-the-world race that no American had finished. So I just stuck it out and was real careful, and I made it to the finish and had this great welcome in France.

One important factor for me to handle all this, in all these different things I want to do, is to come to a conclusion not so much about what you want to do, but how you want to do it.",2,252,137
"So when I was done at the Climate notch, I met an individual who was working for a group that I really liked. It's fascinating that they were able to invite me to join the script that looks at the transition of fossil fuels away from being used in a manner that encourages an increase in their use, I guess, to have to develop a plan for reduction that is very data driven.\n\nAnd I was fortunate enough to be invited by him to a group that is looking at it from multiple angles. I guess what I'm looking to share here is that I find that some people are very driven but they're not just driven when they are young, but driven throughout their life. Because a lot of the people in this group are in their sixties and seventies.\n\nAnd what I find fascinating is the drive they have, the passion they have, even at the age they're at, towards a cause that is important to me right now and I hope is important to me as time goes on. But to be able to do something towards the cause in your elder years, I think, is very admirable because a lot of people become very closely attached to their material accumulation and become fearful of losing what they have or having less tomorrow than what they do today. And I've always suspected that that's what makes people lean more towards the right.\n\nBut I feel that having met a group like this is going to allow me to keep on honing my tribe towards working as a problem solver and topics that are important to me.","I'm the founder and executive director of this company where we design and build homes and commercial buildings that are highly sustainable, that exemplify my personal interest and concern for the state of the environment. I kind of just stumbled into it. I was in an environmental science program at the University of New Hampshire. And then, I stumbled across this book about earthships. And it was these people who were building homes literally out of all recycled materials, basically out of trash.

The principles behind it were the things that sort of inspired me. I decided to go out and get my own contractor's license and eventually built a small company. The thing that I really love about what I do is sort of creating something out of nothing. If you feel happiness on a day to day basis, you're succeeding in life.",2,297,160
"So, growing up in India, we had this festival called Diwali. It's pretty big for the Hindu population. And every year, I couldn't wait to get my hands on firecrackers and go out and burn them with my friends.\n\nAnd it so happened that once I got to 8th grade, my family would let me out with my friends late at night. So, we'd be out in the streets, in the parks, even at 01:00 a.m., 02:00 a.m., bursting firecrackers. And even 20 years later, now I think about that really fun from the perspective of how, first of all, the city was so safe that as a kid, I could be out with my friends deep into the hours of the night. But then also that I always had this love for fire and fireworks.\n\nNow, in the US, it's only on the 4th of July that you get to see fireworks, and I find myself not as drawn to them as I was as a kid. Also, the fact that I'm not burning them myself is just a spectacle that you're watching. But it's just something I've been thinking about lately.","A couple weeks ago for July 4th, we went up to Hiawassee, Georgia, a small mountain town on the border of North Carolina and Georgia. My sister and I were visiting our grandparents to celebrate 4th of July together. Their house was situated on a quiet cove of a lake. This lake is generally what Hiawassee has come to be known for, as it is often covered in boats and recreation. Beautiful houses line the shores of the lake and make it feel magical, of sorts.

The holiday comes around, and as is tradition for those on the lake, everyone takes their boats out to another quiet cove and waits. We wait for fireworks, launched off by the city just after the moon rises. The fireworks the previous year were notably short, to the disbelief of the boat-goers. However, this year the city had certainly made up for it with what was maybe an hour-long show. It was truly incredible. American music was being played from boats in every direction. You could hear the audible gasps and excitement with each new firework. It truly was an incredible sight and time.

Afterwards, many people hung around on their boats talking with friends and even swimming in the black of night, softly lit by boat lights. I'm definitely going back again.",2,224,247
"All right, so I wanted to share about my childhood trauma. So I picked this topic to discuss with you because the experience we have as a child shapes who we are as an adult. Also, internally, I think we all still have, we are still children inside, although we look like we're grown up. I think the internal development happens rather slowly than the outside development. So in that case, I think it's really important to understand in order to understand myself, I wanted to go over my childhood experience and some stories that I still vividly remember.\n\nSo one of the things that I wanted to share with you is when I was like five or six years old, I went to ballet school almost every day. And I took the school bus to commute to the ballet school. And to my young eyes, the distance seemed pretty short. I think it took about ten minutes to commute from my home to the ballet school. And I went to ballet school like I said, almost every day. And I would always look out the window and look at the streets. So to me, I was pretty confident that I could find my way back home without taking the school bus. So I guess as a young child, I was pretty brave and adventurous. So, I decided to walk home without taking the school bus. \n\nSo I started my adventure. And then obviously, like ten minutes by bus, I guess it probably would take more than 35 or 40 minutes by walk. But since I was only five or six, it would have taken more than an hour or so. Obviously, starting at a certain point, I realized that I got lost because all the streets looked unfamiliar and I guess the road started to become much wider. I guess so. I guess I was starting to enter almost like a highway. Because I remember the cars were running really fast and there were so many cars. And the sidewalk was pretty narrow, even to kids like me. So I realized that I got screwed, and I didn't know what to do. So I started to cry. I was hoping that someone would come and help me out but it seemed like the cars were running pretty fast on the road and nobody was reaching out to help me. \n\nSo I don't know how long it took, but I cried and cried and I was just keep walking straight and then suddenly a car pulled off and I still remember this scene but the window went down and a guy asked me, Are you okay? Are you lost? And I was even scared of the person. But in the back of the seat, there was heat. It was about the same age as I was so I think looking at him made me feel much more comfortable speaking with him. So I said, Oh, yeah? I got lost. And I was still crying so hard and I couldn't stop crying because I was so scared. So thankfully, he took me into his car. And he took me to the police station. And from then on, the police took me home because I remembered the apartment names and all that kind of thing. So, thankfully, I went back home safely.\n\nBut I wanted to share this story because it kind of reflected my personality, which I think I still have, and sort of a pattern that I have in my life. So I guess I'm pretty brave and I'm not afraid of trying something new. However, I could underestimate stuff easily. And then, if I face a problem (I mean, I'm talking about me as a young kid), if I face a problem, I would not actively try to solve the problem like asking people for help, but I would just wait until people reach out to me and help me out. So as a young kid, I think that kind of worked because people, thankfully, helped me out and I found my way back home. But a lot of things, these kinds of patterns happened until I was in my early twenties and mid-twenties, I wouldn't actively try to find solutions. But I realized at a certain point that being scared and panicking doesn't help, and I should be more actively proactive in finding a solution on my own. So yeah, I guess I think that's the difference from me as an adult and me as a young kid.","I entered foster care when I was about three and a half years old. During that time, I had 14 different foster homes. I wasn't always placed in the most ideal circumstances. These were people who had problems with drugs, alcohol, violence, pedophilia. So I had this sense of, I've gotta do something. I've gotta say something, this is not okay, and that kept eating at me. That's the motivation that kept me from turning to drugs, or running away, or becoming part of that statistic, that label that they expected of me. 

I had to do something differently. And so all of that gave me this perspective that it's not enough to complain about something if you're not willing to be a part of the solution. So a really big sticking point for me was that I'm not just going to walk around complaining about foster care or complaining about this system of care that's not protecting kids. I wanna be directly involved in the very system that failed me so that I can make it better. 

And I ultimately opened a non-profit organization that provides direct services to children and families. So all of my experiences kind of led me to serving others in a way that I wish I had been served when I was a young person.",4,858,255
"All right, so I wanted to talk about my pack. The experience that I had with my pets. I think pets are a very important part of my adolescence and my childhood. Now, I don\'t have pets anymore. I mean, I\'m now more of a plant person. But when I was young, I had birds, hamsters, and dogs. So, I really loved animals as a young kid and young adolescent and especially today. I want to talk about my first pet, which was a dog. I think the first experience is very meaningful because you are doing it for the first time, so it\'s very special. And also, it\'s more likely that you\'ll make a lot of mistakes, so it\'s likely that you will remember it longer due to, maybe, you may have some regrets. You could do it better if you think back or something like that. So anyways, I think first experience is very important. So, I\'ll share a story about how I had my first talk. So when I was nine years old, about nine years old, it was a summer day, one summer day, and it was late in the evening. I don\'t know why, but I was heading out to do something and it was very rainy. The rain was pouring. It was raining heavily at the moment. And so I took my umbrella and I headed out from home. I lived in an apartment at the time and I was in the lobby. I mean, the elevator opened and as soon as the elevator opened, I saw a wet dog, a little dog. It was soaked in the rain. And it was small, but it looked poor. It was shaking because of the cold and was so wet, and it didn\'t move. It didn\'t move and it just kept making eye contact with me. So I was immediately like, ""Oh my gosh, I have to run back and bring a dry towel or something."" So I took the elevator back to my home again and I was thinking, ""Oh my gosh, I hope the dog doesn\'t go away."" So I went back home and I brought a dry towel. Thankfully, the dog was still there. It was still shaky, but it looked so meek. So I slowly approached it and I wrapped the dog with a dry towel. It didn\'t move or resist or bark or anything. I pet the dog and I looked into its eyes. It was so cute and so poor. So I wanted to bring the dog back home. But I knew that at the time, my mom didn\'t like dogs because she never had a dog before. And I asked her several times before that moment, but she said no, we cannot have dogs. So I was worried. But I brought the dog back home anyway because I didn\'t have any other choice. I don\'t remember her reaction at the time, but we decided to keep the dog. And then I was in elementary school, first and second year. I started to build a bond with my first dog. I would bring.\n\nIn front of the school, they sell junk foods like candies or jellies or whatnot. I now am knowledgeable about how bad it is, how bad junk foods are for dogs. But at the time, I didn\'t have that kind of knowledge. So I would just buy all kinds of junk foods like candies, jellies, snacks. And then I would bring them back home and I\'ll feed the dog. But there was a very joyful moment. And I would go out with the dog and I was very happy to have the dog. It was like the dog was my very good friend. So I think, I don\'t know how many months later, but the dog started to grow. And also, my mom was sick at the time, so she mostly spent her time in bed. And the dog started to make some kind of mess. The dog, I guess, was in the adolescent phase, so it started to mess around the house. It would pee here and there and it would chew the furniture. So my mom was starting to get annoyed. And then one day, when I returned from school with junk foods, I realized the dog was missing. So I asked my mom and she told me that she sent the dog to one of our relatives who had a dog and lived in a house, not an apartment, and where there was a big yard. So she sent the dog to their family. So I was like, she didn\'t even ask me before she sent it off. So I was crying all day long. Obviously, I was so angry and so sad. But since she said she told me that we can always go visit the dog because the dog was at our relative\'s house. And then I think, like, a week later, she told me that the dog ran away from their family and now the dog is missing. So my last hope was gone. I was hoping that I would go visit their family and reunite with the dog. But now the dog had run away from that house. And it kind of stuck. And I always kind of thought that the dog will find a way back to me. I would always imagine or expect that thought. I was so smart that he might be able to find a way. So before I go to bed, I would pray like, ""Oh my gosh, please let the dog find a way to my apartment."" But that never happened. And as a young kid, I would always think, ""What happened to my first dog?""","I love animals. When I was growing up, my mom had a black Labrador called Nicky. And after Nicky passed away, it was a couple of years later that we got a miniature poodle called Mocha. So from a young age, up until now, I've always been around animals and dogs specifically.

I was a volunteer at the City Humane Society for a year and a half, where I pretty much just got to learn about the process of the shelter, kind of what the environment is like. And I ended up falling in love with all the people here, and just the whole environment and the animals.

I wouldn't have known how much I enjoyed working with the animals until I actually did it. I've gone 20-something years not living for myself, always kind of feeling that I had to please someone else. At the end of the day, it's gonna be your life, and you're gonna be the one that looks back on it.",4,1113,192
"So today, I wanted to share a story about one of my friends from childhood. Her name was Tajong, and ""Tajang"" means kindness and sweetness in Korean. And just like her name indicates, she was a very nice and kind person.\n\nMy friend, when I was like eight or nine years old, and we were the same age, but she was much more mature than all the other kids who were the same age. She was almost like an older sister to me. I didn\'t have any younger or older sisters, so I felt like she was like my older sister. She was also taller, much taller than me. So I felt like she was very nice and mature and kind to me, so I guess I would act more like a baby when I\'m with her.\n\nAnyways, whenever we met to play together, she gave me a small gift, like a scented eraser. At the time, I didn\'t appreciate her gift that much because she would give me very small gifts every time we met, and I almost took it for granted. And I didn\'t give her anything. I don\'t know why, but I took her gift and also showed me a lot of kindness and friendship towards me. Whatever I asked her to do, she would say yes. And she would adjust her schedule to mine, and she would come to my neighborhood to play with me. So we had this kind of relationship where, almost always, starting with almost always, whatever I would ask her to do.\n\nAnyway, every time she would come to play at my apartment or my neighborhood, we played something fun. And one day, I called her to play at my apartment, but she didn\'t show up, so I got really mad. And later I figured out she was going to move to another city. And she gave me a handwritten letter as a parting gift. And at the time, I was still mad because she didn\'t show up when I asked her to play with me. So I was a little salty. But after she left for another city and I couldn\'t see her anymore, I kind of realized how much I relied on her. I felt so empty and lonely because she was gone.\n\nAnd one day, I opened my desk drawer, and the drawer was full of the scented erasers that she gave me as gifts. And I didn\'t use any of them, so they still smelled very good. And at the time, as soon as I saw all the erasers in one place, I kind of realized at the time how nice and good a friend she was to me. So I regretted a lot that I lost her and I could not meet her anymore. And I also regretted that I didn\'t give her any gifts.\n\nI could never forget her name, even after several years. I always missed her, but at the time, we didn\'t have any means to contact each other because we only had our home phones. Well, I guess I was too young to ask her house phone number or whatever.\n\nAnyways, I lost her contact, but she\'s always in my mind, just like her name Tajong suggests. She was a very kind and sweet person. And I will always remember her as someone who was very mature even at a young age and who showed a big heart and friendship towards me.","When growing up, my sister and I were not on the best of terms during our childhood. I would theorize it could have been mostly due to competition for the affection of our parents. I was the second child, she was the first. She was the one with stellar grades all throughout her education, from kindergarten all the way through her prestigious university years. She is now a professional musician in an orchestra as well as a music teacher.

Growing up, I tended to be a rather mediocre student. I am confident that I am intelligent, I just never have had the drive to excel. Perhaps because I knew devoting a great deal of energy to ""competing"" with my sister would not only be futile, but absolutely exhausting. I have always been one to get lost in my thoughts, and I prefer to be in nature to feel truly alive.

That is why it was so memorable that a few months ago, my mother told me that recently my sister told her that she only knows particular symphonies because she would hear me playing them in my room, next door to hers. I did not even know she was listening to the music I was playing. I always pictured her diligently reading and/or practicing the various instruments with which she is now proficient.

After hearing that from my mother, I actually felt a rush of pride. Not only was I absorbing and getting lost in the extraordinary music, but I was also influencing my orchestral musician sister.

To add to that, the other day, she called me up about a certain composer because, as she put it, I am a ""musicologist of sorts."" (In addition to listening to music, I would study biographical information about the various composers to whom I listened.)

Back in my childhood days, I never would have dreamed that I would be having an unintended influence on my rather brilliant sister. It just goes to show that perceptions of the moment are not always accurate... it helps to get perspective outside of your own head.",4,644,391
"Oh. So today, I wanted to share a story about my grandmother on my father\'s side. Growing up, I wasn\'t very close with my grandmother because she kind of looked cold. She was a reserved personality and she was very quiet. She didn\'t talk much and we didn\'t talk much. So I guess, I was kind of scared of her growing up. And she also lived in another city, so I didn\'t get to see her that often. And I\'m not sure if it\'s the same for everyone, but for me personally, I felt much closer to my grandparents on my mother\'s side than to my grandparents on my father\'s side. And one of the reasons it felt more difficult communicating with my grandma was because my grandfather on my father\'s side had a stroke earlier in his life. He\'s half paralyzed, so he could not talk. So it was kind of very awkward being in my grandparents\' place where my grandma and grandpa don\'t talk that much to each other either. So I guess I didn\'t feel comfortable growing up. However, our relationship started to develop and my father asked them to move near our house so that my parents could take care of them. So when I was in my first year of middle school, they moved to our neighborhood. My dad kind of forced me to visit my grandparents\' place either with my mom or with my dad. So almost every weekend, I visited them. And I could definitely feel that my grandma was pleased to see me, especially because she would always sit next to me, and she would smile at me, looking at my face. At the time, we also didn\'t talk much. We would mainly just stay there and watch television together, but I could definitely feel that hospitality of hers. So anyways, our relationship changed dramatically when I moved to Canada to study abroad in my second year of middle school. So at the time, I was in this foreign country on my own, so I was really lonely and I missed home. So I called home very often, and almost every day, I called home. And one day, my dad told me to call my grandma. So I wanted to talk to everybody at the time because I missed home, so I called my grandma without expecting too much because I know she\'s quiet and she doesn\'t talk much. But as soon as she heard my voice, she started to cry. And I don\'t know why, but I also started to cry because I felt that at that moment, I think I realized how much she adored me. So after that moment, after our exchange of emotions, I kind of realized that she adored me so much and she missed me a lot. So after a year, I returned back to South Korea, and then I visited her place more often than I did before. As I entered high school, I visited her during the lunch break because her place was right next to my high school. So I guess we became much closer. However, I decided to study abroad in the US for college. So during the college years, I didn\'t get to see her that much, only once or twice a year when I visited South Korea during winter or summer break. And it was one summer she got cancer, and she fell very ill. And I don\'t know, all of this developed so fast, and she was in a hospice. Oh, she was in the hospice, not hospital. She was in the hospice. And my parents told me, ""You don\'t have much time with her, so you should visit her more often."" But I was kind of scared of visiting the hospice and seeing her because I had never experienced the death of someone who\'s close to me. So I was kind of scared of visiting, so I didn\'t end up visiting her a lot. But it was one day that I was in her hospice, and I was sitting next to her bed, and she just looked at me and she smiled. She smiled like she used to when I visited her house. And then the next day, she passed away. So I guess I cried a lot during the funeral because I regretted a lot for not visiting her as often as I should have. And I knew that she adored me, and she adored me the most out of all her grandchildren. I guess I was special to her, and she was also a special person to me. So after she died, I kind of thought about death and relationships and those kinds of things. And I also reflected on her life a lot. And I started to realize that she must have been really lonely because her husband, my grandfather, could not talk for a very long time and he couldn\'t walk like just any other people. He always needed help from my grandma. And I guess my grandmother, it wasn\'t easy for my grandfather to live a life, but I also could imagine it wouldn\'t have been any easier for my grandmother either. So thinking about their lives and my grandma\'s life, I kind of feel a little bit heavy about life. But yeah, but one day she appeared in my dream. And in my dream, I didn\'t know that she had passed away. But I don\'t know why, but I was so delighted to see her. I ran to her and I hugged her. And she looked really nice in my dream. She dressed up very nicely. She was wearing very colorful and beautiful clothes. She didn\'t use to wear those kinds of clothes when she was alive. But in my dream, she wore a very colorful and beautiful dress. So I was like, ""Oh, grandma, you look so nice."" And so I felt very delighted and happy to see her. So when I woke up, I realized, alright, she passed away. I realized that she passed away. But I kind of felt relieved to see her in my dream. And she looked very well and happy and healthy. So I guess in my dream, I just wanted to, I guess through my dream, I wanted to comfort myself and relieve that guilt that I felt towards her. And I guess I wanted to wish her well and happiness wherever she is. So that\'s my story.","My grandma in Oregon passed away a couple of weeks ago. The process was painful to hear about, and it hit me harder than I thought it would. I was very close to my grandma, and so was my mom. My mom's siblings put her on Hospice about three weeks ago, and within a week, she was gone.

There was a lot of family drama over her passing, and I did not agree with how she was taken care of in the end. I feel she was pushed into the direction of death by being heavily medicated, and her family members that were there were not getting her up out of bed anymore. I realize people get old, and everyone's time comes, but I feel like it wasn't her time yet. But you can't go back in time, and she's gone now.

I was able to travel with my parents and sister to Oregon to attend her funeral. It was an emotional rollercoaster. The hardest day for me was when the day before her funeral, I found out that there had been rules put in place by my uncle that no grandkids were going to be able to go view my grandma and say goodbye. Because of all the drama, he wanted to hurt everyone he could that wasn't on his side.

I went to the funeral home with my parents anyway, in hopes that I might still get a chance. After arguing with the funeral director, it was decided that I would not be able to go in the room. I was crushed; I was so hurt and upset, but I was trying to hold it together for my mom.

My mom was able to go in for a while and sit with her mom, so I waited outside with other family members. After some time, my mom came outside in a hurry and told me to come quickly. I didn't know what had happened, but apparently, the funeral director had a change of heart and decided to go against the request of my uncle and let me go view my grandma.

Walking in that room was so surreal. I couldn't believe my beloved grandma was lying there in her coffin. I never thought it would bother me as much as it did. I couldn't even bring myself to touch her. I guess I was scared or in denial.

It was an emotional couple of weeks, to say the least.",5,1233,464
"So, since we are talking about moving to a new place, I wanted to share my story about my history of my relocation and how my perspective in life has changed since then. So, I've been living in different countries since I was young. I lived in Canada, India, and now I live in the US. I was originally born and raised in South Korea, so I guess so far I've lived in four different countries. I also traveled to many different countries like Japan, Europe, and Southeast Asia as well. So, I guess I enjoyed a nomadic lifestyle—not nomadic like Nomad lifestyle because I am a person with a lot of curiosity and I like exploring something new. And the excitement, for excitement of exploring new places, like overweight the desire to settle down and feel more stable, I guess. However, I realized recently that my perspective is being changed. Part of it is because I think I've already moved three times already this year from different apartments. So, I'm really tired of packing and unpacking and cleaning the old places and new places. I'm kind of tired of doing all that. But more importantly, I think I'm more focused on my career development and my expertise nowadays. So, I guess the excitement coming from my career and pursuing my dream is more important now than to travel and exploring new cities and meeting new people. So, I finally feel like I found a career and a job that I can—I feel like I can dedicate my life to it. I'm pretty satisfied with where I am, and in order to do a better job at what I'm doing, I guess I want my environment to be more stable than just jumping from place to place. And also, what else? Also, like my taste, have been developing, and now I have a lot of books, a collection of magazines. So, I like photography, so I have a lot of camera equipment. And I have like drawing tablets that are pretty big, and I use my own computer for video editing and stuff. So, I have a lot of stuff that I use for my job and for my hobby, and that reflects my taste. So, it's been quite annoying to bring all those things around. So, that's also part of the reason that I wanted to settle down. Also, I wanted to, like recently I've been thinking that I really want to buy a house, and not buy a house, but I want to buy land and I want to build my own house and decorate it and design it to reflect my taste, to reflect my personality and my interests and stuff. So, yeah, I'm aiming to do that in the next couple of years. So, I'm going to work hard and try to achieve that dream. But, I haven't still figured out where I want to settle down, I guess. That's not a problem. That's going to be number one homework that I need to make a decision before I actually purchase a house. That's how my perspective and lifestyle has evolved from a nomadic lifestyle to somewhere who takes more stability in settlement.","I wanted to make things, I wanted to build things, I wanted to contribute to society. I wanted to make the world a better place if that's possible in architecture. And then I went to architecture school, and I never looked back. I always felt that's what I wanted to do, and I feel very fortunate.

I began by designing exhibitions. And one thing led to another, and so I don't know where the next job's coming from, but somewhere, somehow, it appears.

There's no one way. There are so many things you can do, and there are so many things you can do well, but you can't do them all. It's not so much what you do, it's how you do it and what your attitude is about it.

I think that if people just decide this is what gives them pleasure, that's what they should be doing.",3,624,180
"Okay. So, I would like to share my story about losing weight and gaining weight. So, growing up, I wasn\'t sad. I was normal- normal weight in the normal average weight range. Maybe a little bit on the skinny, not skinny, a little bit on the less than average weight size because I really liked exercise- learning. I learned ballet, I learned like martial arts and dance and all kinds of that. So, I did move a lot, so I wasn\'t really fat. But one day, when I was 15, I suddenly gained a lot of weight. And I\'m going to talk about why in a moment. \n\nSo, the reason why I wanted to discuss with you the history of my losing and gaining weight is because I know that a lot of young women and men have issues and they really just work out hard or sometimes they just restrict their diet so drastically. So, it affects their health and all kinds of that. I think nowadays, physical beauty kind of became central to one\'s identity and I also can empathize. I also have those kind of issues. So, I thought it would be interesting to talk about that as it reflects the current trends and issues that most young people are experiencing. \n\nSo, I\'ll go back to my own story. So, when I was 15, I studied abroad in Canada and it was my first time ever to live on my own without having family around. So, everything was really new, and I couldn\'t speak English or understand English very well. So, I had a lot of trouble adjusting to the new environment. So, I developed a lot of anxiety and I guess I was a little bit paranoid at the time. And the only thing that gave me comfort was food. So, whenever I was scared or whenever I felt insecure, I guess I started eating to make me feel better. \n\nSo, I lived in a dormitory and on the first floor of my dormitory, there was a kitchen which stored fruits and cereals 24 hours so I could always go to that kitchen and have bananas, apples, and cereals whenever I wanted. And especially, late at night, I felt more insecure than worried about the next day and stuff. So, after midnight, I would go down to the kitchen and I started eating a lot of bananas, a lot of cereals until like 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. And then, without noticing, three months later, I gained like 20 pounds. \n\nSo, I didn\'t realize the change in my look, but people around me, they told me that, ""Oh, you gained some weight."" So, I kind of had noticed that I might have gained some weight, but I didn\'t really care that much about weight gain. So, like about a year later, after two semesters, I decided to return back to South Korea because obviously, I couldn\'t adapt to the new place. And so, I returned to my old school and then my friends didn\'t even recognize me because I gained so much weight and I looked totally different. \n\nSo, after returning back from South Korea, I slowly lost weight. But I think I brought the psychological issues with me, which was when I felt anxious or stressed, I would go search for food. So, there was a link between the stress and the food that was built in my mentality. So, I lost a little bit of weight but I never returned to the normal weight as I was before studying abroad. So, when I\'m under a lot of stress, I would gain weight and when I\'m feeling fine and when I\'m having a good time, I wouldn\'t eat too much. So, this fluctuation of weight started since then and then until I think it did continue until recently. \n\nBut as I got older and I reflected more on my life, I recently started to watch a lot of inspirational videos and workout videos. So, starting from this year, I started to work out more often, and I started to go to the gym a lot. And I started to learn Thai chi and boxing. So, I started to learn martial arts again and I think they really helped me to, I think they helped me to find the issues that I had, which is like a better control of myself and my stress. So instead of going for food, I could manage the stress better. I guess more like a cake later, I started to break this linkage between the food and my anxiety and all that. So, I guess that\'s a huge jump for me. So, I\'m continuing to do that, I\'m planning on continuing to develop this healthy habit. And yeah, I would just like to have better control of myself and my stress.","When Elizabeth was born, who is our child with a disorder called dyspraxia, you quickly learn that that's like a job in itself. In Elizabeth's case, she's so globally affected that her fine motor, gross motor, oral motor, all of that is affected, as well as how she processes thoughts.

She learned to ride a bike last summer, which is huge in Elizabeth's world. It was hard work, and even though she's 18 and riding a bike, and even though most kids ride their bike.

It's okay. You're gonna get there. You're gonna get there on your timeframe. And I think once you can understand that time is just a concept that someone made up and said at this age you do this and at this age you do that, but you can't let that be what guides you in feeling success or not.

I think that's so critical, do it when it works for you. Be proud of your accomplishments whenever they do come and lose the ""have tos"" of the timeline.",3,935,209
"So today, I'd like to share how my perspective on happiness changed throughout my life. Since I was really young, I feel like I kinda knew how difficult life would be. A lot of responsibilities and pain would be involved. After I grow up or as I grow up, since I was a little kid, I really wanted to avoid that kind of pain and pursue only happiness in my life. That is, for me at the time, happiness meant status without pain, and only joy and pleasure exist. So I hated, as a teenager or as a college university student, I hated taking the past or doing stuff that I didn't want to do, like studying a subject that I'm not interested in. And I only wanted to study subjects that I am interested in or do something that I really enjoy. And I think this mindset wasn't helping me to grow because I always try to avoid painful situations or painful experiences. It hindered my growth. Now I look back, I understand that. But anyway, since I was young, I was interested in Buddhism because Buddhism seemed like it talked about breaking out of painful life and going to the status of endless peace and happiness. So when I was in my mid-20s, early 20s, I did practice some Buddhism. Some practices I practiced were meditations and practices done in Buddhism oftentimes. But I don't know when, starting from when, but my perspective towards happiness slowly started to change as I was exposed to military content and army content. There was some popularity towards the ex-Navy SEAL-like ex-army officers that arose in the last couple of years in the US and in South Korea as well. And I've been watching their content and motivational content from the ex-Navy SEALs or ex-army officers or whatever. And it fully changed my perspective towards pain and happiness. They all talked about it. It was interesting to me because I was trying to avoid pain, but they were willingly accepting the pain or even welcoming the pain. And they go through painful situations on their own and willingly. So watching how different they are from me was interesting and I started to learn from their lessons and learn from their stories. And now my interest also slowly shifted to, like, MMA players, you know, mixed martial artists and the UFC, because they're all fighters and they go through a lot of hard training and painful training. It inspired me a lot. I think this kind of exposure to totally different people inspired me and made me think about happiness in totally different perspectives. And I also realized slowly that my level of happiness never changes. I have, for example, this year I achieved some of my goals that I said earlier in the year, but the joy only lasts for, like, 30 minutes or so, and then I'm going back to the same level of happiness that I was before. And also, when my environment changed this year, it was really difficult for me. But after a couple of days, I got used to the new environment and new situation. I thought I would be miserable forever, but I was okay. Actually, after a couple of days, and I restored a level of happiness that I contained before. So this made me realize that actually, happiness is I cannot gain happiness by avoiding pain, but happiness is kind of always there with me. And no matter what happens in my life, I'll be okay. And actually, painful experiences help me to realize that I'll always be okay and I always have the same kind of happiness level. So I don't really need to avoid pain or pursue happiness. So yeah, I think that's how my perspective towards happiness evolved over the last couple of years.","After watching School of Life and painfully finding ways of filling up my own bucket, and cleansing my social media so as to not attract the wrong kind of ppl luring me into hookups when all I really want is love, and looking up literature on what healthy relationships could be, even when it was easier to remain dejected and pessimistic, I feel so proud of being in a place where I can be a giver of love.

I still don’t believe in fairy tale endings because I know that there will always be challenges in relationships and even bouts of getting so irritated with your partner - even in stellar marriages - but I believe in humility, respect, compassion, charity of interpretation, sincerity, understanding, vulnerability, kindness, and integrity. And I believe that I can choose to creatively find ways of inviting joy and romance to my and my partner’s shared lives, and to acquire the wisdom and discernment to honor and generously apply those values.

I feel sober and hopeful, which is more than my adolescent self and her emotionally turbulent experiences could have dreamed of.

There really needs to be a class on love and relationships. It would save us all a lot of heartache.",3,731,231
"So, I've been thinking lately about myself. I have many hobbies and interests, and I enjoy doing them all. And mostly, they are not a group activity but more individual activities focused on individual activities. And I love doing them because it makes me feel like I'm learning something and I'm expanding my horizon. However, I also feel like I'm not really good at group activities or doing something together with other people. I think I need to work on it. \n\nSo, for example, yesterday, my husband and I were actually planning on going hiking in New Hampshire with his lab mate. However, yesterday I decided that I could not go because I had some projects that I wanted to work on. These are personal projects and projects related to work. So, I told him that I could not go and he should go with his friends. And of course, he was disappointed and pretty mad because of the change of plan. So, we had a little bit of an argument. And then, he left for hiking this morning. But, it makes me feel bad about it. \n\nSo, I was reflecting on myself. Maybe am I being too selfish by putting my personal project or my work-related project before family or people? So, I think I've been like this since I was young. I think I always had many interests and I was always involved in different activities. And those were usually focused on the project itself rather than the relationship with people. So, I think this is who I am, part of who I am. But it arises as some kind of problem or center of conflict when I'm in a relationship or when I'm with family, with people who I care about. I don't know how to solve this problem. And I think this will always be an issue. And I hope that my husband or my other family or friends could understand about this. But I also understand that it might be a little selfish desire for other people to understand that I'm putting my work and my project behind them. That's why I'm feeling a little bit. Not depressed, but feeling a little bit of self-reflection time here.","I am very bad at handling adversity. A slight mishap and my mind goes haywire. The effect is exaggerated when something happens between me and people I care about. I broke up with my ex a while ago and it's been miserable since. I can't take her out of my head. Even when I'm busy doing something, thoughts of her creep into my mind. It's like I can't even think of anything else. While driving, while eating, while talking with people, I just can't get her picture out of my head.

I haven't been enjoying my job as well. I don't find any meaning in what I do. The chances that I'll have to work for the rest of my life for 5 days a week got me really anxious. I feel suffocated. Burdened. Unhappy. To escape all this madness within my mind, I've come to live with my friends for a while.

Away from home, I thought my friends being around will help me distract my mind. It did not help. I feel unwanted. I feel miserable around them and the thought that I'm probably ruining their time as well makes me more miserable. I wanted to cry yesterday, but couldn't. We were having dinner, everyone talking and laughing and I just couldn't even smile.

I wish I did not have these bonds. I wish I was alone. I wish I never made friends, never fell in love. These connections bring a lot of joy but they also add these complications and anxiety which is just worse. There's nothing I want more than peace. I just don't want to have all these convoluted emotions in my head. I try to silence them but the noise just does not go away.

I am tired of these thoughts, the anxiety, the heaviness it all brings. I just want to be at peace with myself.",4,429,369
"So, I have a friend who recently lost his father due to a tragic car accident. And I heard this news on a day of going for dinner. I felt really bad for my friend, and I was so heartbroken because I know how kind and sweet of a person my friend is. So, I could see that although I haven't seen his father, I could see that he must have grown in a very happy family. And he talked about his father a couple of times, so I know that he loves his family and his father, of course. So, I know how difficult it would be for him. It was very difficult for me also, thinking about it. I felt so powerless. I feel like nothing could comfort him in this situation. So, I felt really bad that I could not do much for him. It also got me to think about my own family as well. How would I feel if my dad suddenly passed away? I couldn't even imagine that. And I have a really good relationship with my dad, and I talk with him about everything. So, losing someone that important, that close, and who supports you, who made you actually, in this, would be unimaginable. I've experienced that with my grandparents, but I think it's very different from losing your parents. So, yeah, it got me thinking about relationships and death in life, in general. So, I think it's inevitable. I will die someday also. And I will see my parents die someday. So, I should always take the moments in time preciously because it's not going to last forever. This tragic happened to my friend just got me thinking a lot about those kinds of philosophical questions. Sometimes, just thinking about that makes me feel so humble and makes me feel like everything is less important than I am actually thinking it is. But yeah, I don't know how to... I guess I'm trying to think on a brighter side. It can also broaden my perspective somehow and embrace the difficult moments in life as more grateful. But I was very heartbroken to hear my friend's youth. And yeah, I just thought I wanted to share this story to hear what you think about.","Two years ago, my mom passed away. It was the worst day of my life, and a day I will never forget. It was very unexpected and traumatic. It was a Sunday morning, and I got the call from my dad who told me she had passed. I just remember screaming and not really being able to do much else. I told my husband, and we both just cried and cried.

I couldn't believe what was happening and was too young to lose my mom. I remember collapsing while trying to pack to fly to where she and my dad lived. I had a young daughter at the time, and my heart was breaking for her that she would never get to know my mom. And that my mom wouldn't be able to get to know her.

I mourned the lost time and the major events my mom would not be a part of. It was heartbreaking. The rest of the day was a big blur, as I just went through the motions and didn't even really remember much. When we got to my parents' house, we were surrounded by family and friends, but I felt so lonely.

I remember just going into her room and crying, thinking how could this be happening. It was the worst day, and even 2 years later, it still is hard to breathe when I think about it. She died from pneumonia. Something that happens all the time to people, but it took my mom. Emotionally, it has been so daunting. Losing someone you love that much is so hard, and is not something you ever get over.

The days get easier to get through, but that moment is always in the back of your mind, and the person lost is always thought of.",3,443,341
"Okay. So this isn't really anything exciting? It's not an exciting story. But it's something that I learned recently about myself. So I thought it'd be interesting to share. Wait, let me take a look at my note. So, I think when I was young, younger, I really wanted to achieve something in life really fast. And I wanted to be recognized as a successful person. So I had this very big desire. But I'm so naturally I searched for a field or area where I thought I have a competitive advantage. And one of the fields or professions that I found that I could do better than other people was in the creative writing field. So I got a lot of compliments from teachers and family and friends about my writing skills or my imaginations. So when I was like early twenties, I wanted to become a famous novelist or successful TV scriptwriter or a filmmaker. So I did internships, and I worked as a writer at a radio station, like a production company and youth agency. But I didn't last long in those fields because I was so impatient. I wanted to be really this famous writer. But what I was at the time was like a low-paying freelance writer and I could not bear that difficulties, and could not. I didn't have like, it wasn't like because fortunately, I had the support of my family. Even though I was low pay. I didn't have to worry too much about financial issues, but I was just very disgruntled about how, the stage I was in, I guess. So I felt like I'm like the lowest person in this organization. And nobody really listens to me, and I couldn't stand that struggle. So I called it quits, and I jumped to the other area or field and industry. And I think when I look back, I think I was very immature and impatient at the time. If I was a little bit wiser, I would have seen those struggles and difficulty of learning opportunities, or opportunities to grow. But I just really wanted to be at the finish line rather than going through this step by step. So now, today I'm in a completely different field and not doing anything related to writing. Although I believe writing is very essential in all kinds of work and industry. Now I think I'm a little bit, I've learned my lesson from the past experience. However, today I felt like I was like the younger self. I was feeling a little bit agitated about who I am right now. And I was comparing myself to whom I want to be in the future. And I would not be very satisfied about myself, but since I had older now, and I'm more experienced. Not immediately, but I kind of try to remind myself the outcome that I had. If I have that kind of mentality. So I guess I'm trying to self-talk, trying to reinforce myself more in a more positive way. And rather than jump to the end result. I'm trying to enjoy this moment. I know it sounds very cliché, but I'm really trying to be grateful about my surroundings and who I am right now. I think it's good for my mind. And I think it's more, it gives me more motivation and energy to continue to work on my future goals.","I really did not ever plan to be a writer. I started college when I was 40. I'm a little sorry to say it took me until I was 40 to find a big change, but I just thought I was doing the right things: raising a family, and I worked. 

I was the most terrified freshman that ever went to school. There was this one class that fit into my schedule, and it was called Advanced Fiction Writing, and I enrolled in it thinking I'll fail, and they'll throw me out. 

But I had learned so much. I had come so far. I just felt like now I will live. This is it. This is the stepping stone, and I will not look back. 

It's important never to give up looking for your passion. And never to think that it's only one way. Don't be surprised if what you end up finding isn't what you were looking for. Because what I found had almost nothing to do with what I thought I was looking for.",4,660,204
"So today, I want to share a story about my history as a driver. I have a reputation for being a bad driver, especially among my family and friends, because I have some stories of me making some bad decisions as a driver. So first of all, when I first bought my car when I was, like, 21, I think 21, I bought a car and I took the car and was driving back home with it. While I was trying to turn left, there was a huge truck right next to me with a long trailer. And of course, as a new driver, I wasn't very good at gauging the distance, so I hit the truck's trailer with the right side of my bumper. So I ruined my first car. I think it was after ten minutes, it was more than, like, 50 minutes after I started to drive. So that's the first story. And obviously, I was very heartbroken, but thankfully, I didn't get hurt and the truck driver didn't get hurt. He was super nice and said it's okay and nothing is too damaged, just my car, so he let me go. So yeah, that was the story of me on my first car. The second story is that while I was driving with four friends in my car, I ran into a reversed way, so I saw another car coming right at us very far, and my friend sitting next to me started to scream, like, started to scream, and she got really scared. Thankfully, I saw another way out on the side, so I immediately, like, as soon as I saw the car coming right at me, I turned my wheel and then entered a different lane. So unfortunately, well, I didn't kill anybody and nobody got hurt, but it kind of was a really scary moment. And then when I was in San Francisco, I was in the Bay Bridge, there was a lot of traffic jammed, a lot of congestion in the Bay Bridge, and I was driving, I thought I was just casually driving, but then suddenly, when the car in front of my car stopped because of the traffic jam, the driver right in front of my car came out, and she started to scream at me. I didn't understand what she was saying because I was inside my car, but then I kind of realized that she was saying I was tailgating her, I was driving too close to her car, so she got really mad. Yeah, and there are a lot more stories of me hitting a wall while I was driving, I was trying to park. These stories kind of shaped me as a bad driver. But now, and also my husband, he doesn't like me driving because he thinks I'm reckless. But in my perspective, I think my husband is driving like he's driving too safely. He always tries to never, ever go beyond the speed limit. And I think that's just too strict. I think it's okay, I mean, you have to abide by the rules, but he's just always abiding by the rules. And for example, at a stop sign, I stop at the stop sign, but he scolds me because I don't stop for, like, 5 seconds or something. And he thinks that we have to keep that five-second rule or something. So, like driving, I was very stressed because of the driving. When I drive and my husband's next to me, we always fight. So, I kind of stopped driving and I let him drive. It's been a while since I haven't driven for a long time, but recently, I started to. Recently, I have this urge to drive, and I feel like I want to drive because I just want to feel more independent and I just want to have a lifestyle and that kind of lifestyle that I want to pursue kind of needs driving. So, I want to, like, for example, I want to go hiking on the weekends to a different state somewhere far, and I also want to go to the beach whenever I want to go and I want to listen to music in my car and have my own time or something in solitude. And I also sometimes want to drive motorcycles. For me, I think it's important to get back to driving and also, I don't want to hurt anybody or put anybody in danger like I did in the past. So, I want to also be a good driver as well. So, it's my goal to start driving again and also to be a confident, good driver.","This happened about 3 months ago. I was driving with my brother back from the movie theater when we were sideswiped by another car. It spun us around into the median and was completely terrifying. It really came out of nowhere and gave me no time to react or take any preventative measures. We both looked at each other shocked when we came to a stop. We checked on each other to make sure we were both okay, which we were.

We got out of my car to assess the damage and make sure the other driver was okay. The other driver got out of their car and was obviously under the influence. You could see the wobble in them from 20 feet away. My car, which was pretty new, was smashed in the rear driver side, but not as bad as I would have thought.

The other driver looked to be in his mid-20s and started to freak out a bit when he realized that we were calling the police. The police got there really quickly and gave the guy a field sobriety test, which he failed miserably. I exchanged information with one of the officers while we waited for a tow truck to come. The other driver was arrested, and my car was towed away.

It is the only major accident I've ever been in, besides one or two small fender benders in parking lots. Surprisingly, my car was mostly okay. It's a 2012 Subaru Legacy that I spent a lot of time saving up for. I'm not entirely sure what happened to the other driver, but his insurance settled out with us.

Ironically, my car was salvaged out about a month later due to hail damage (somehow that was more costly than this accident).",4,918,331
"When I was a little kid, I used to play chess all the time. I used to be really good at it too. At one point, I was ranked 20th in the country, and I used to go to tournaments all the time. I used to go to places like Las Vegas, San Diego, and I used to spend all my weekends just at tournaments. It was pretty fun, and it was nice for my parents to drive me all that way so that I could compete in chess tournaments.","I'm 23 and just kind of finding my own path. I wrestled when I was 11 years old. It was because my dad got me into it. I went out and got my butt kicked by every other middle school kid I went up against, 35 times in a row.

Before I was really capable of making decisions for myself, my parents had rooted in me that I needed to find a way to persevere in the things that mattered the most. Whether it was figuring out how to feed myself or clothe myself, just day to day activities.

Athletically, they wouldn't let me quit in the middle of the season. It went a long way. They taught me not to give up so easily.

My biggest complaint with the American system and graduating high school, going to college, and getting a job is that the common progression is to prepare you to be an employee. But you don't have to. There's ways and avenues to be able to go around and make something happen and build a business around something that you love.",3,101,206
"But yeah, one time I went kayaking in Seattle with my girlfriend. And we were in a tandem kayak. So we were both on the same kayak, both trying to pedal. And as a joke, I started pedaling backwards, and she was confused as to why she wasn't moving forward.","We live in Canada, and sometimes the winters can get long. November is gloomy. December is usually cheerful just because of the holidays, good food, and people, and then it drags out with freezing temperatures, dark nights, and crappy driving conditions from January through April. I find I get sad around February since I'm just wishing for sunlight and for my face not to hurt when I go outside.

We finally got a huge dump of snow, and my husband and I picked up our season passes and went snowboarding for the first time. Did I fall an insane amount? Yes. Were some of my wipeouts spectacular? Absolutely. Do I know what I'm doing? Not particularly. Am I in pain? My butt is so bruised, I'm looking like a plum. But man, did we have fun.

When I first brought it up in October, my husband said he wanted to go with me, and I was thrilled. He's a bit of a homebody in the winter, so I was just excited to be able to share a sport with him. We bought all of our gear without even having tried the sport and just waited for the perfect time to go.

We had so much fun, and I'm really looking forward to hitting the hills tomorrow and again later this week too! I get to spend quality time with him, we're being active, we're learning something new together, and we're spending time outdoors—it's the best of all the worlds combined.

It's making the winter seem so much shorter since I'm actually wishing for winter to stay and more snow to hit. It really helped change my attitude on winter.",5,59,327
"It. Yeah? So last? When I was seven years old, I moved back to India from the United States.","I moved away from my home country to live free when I was 19. I didn't want to live in a third-world country. I hated the lack of freedom. I got accepted to a college abroad, but my parents couldn't support me anymore because of currency devaluation. I hated seeing my dad work so hard; I always feared that if his health deteriorated because of me, I would never be able to forgive myself. 

They can't help me. I had to quit my school and I found a job. I worked 3 and a half years and quit afterwards due to problems in my workplace. Meanwhile, I dealt with my physical health problems and supported myself without the help of my parents. I saved up and invested so that I would have enough money to live around 15 months. 

Now I am trying to set up my own business, earn money by freelancing, doing anything to get ahead, to show what I am capable of. To have good people around me. To live free. To not lose my freedom. 

I am 24, unemployed and without capital to start my business; my savings are getting lower by the day and I feel a bit scared. A couple of ventures I tried already failed. I made some money meanwhile, but it is by no means enough. 

A good friend of mine told me I should finish my degree because otherwise, I am just a hustler. If you finish your degree, you would be a professional hustler, he said. I hate to break it to him. I don't have money to pay for college, and I can't get a loan to pay for it because I am an immigrant and have nothing to back it up, and even if I did, I would be in debt and 28 years old by the time I graduate. I would have to study with 18-year-olds, and I wouldn't be able to work as much while studying. 

I can't get a job in business and gain practical experience because I don't have a degree. All I can do is work.",5,24,402
"So last winter, I went skiing in Big Bear, California. And I\'ve been skiing before, but this particular time, the snow was really wet. It wasn\'t soft. There wasn\'t a lot of snow that year, and so I had a hard time braking. So, I fell down a lot. It sounds painful, but it was actually kind of funny because I went on the steeper slopes, and my friends were like, ""you should just do it."" And then I did it. And then I started to fall. But in the end, it was pretty fun, even though I felt weak. We went and got some ramen after, some Fu afterwards. And the warmth of the Fu really helped warm me up after falling in the snow all day.","Today is the day of the competition; we were so excited but apprehensive about this trip. Ben has been preparing for several months, but are you ever really prepared? I could not sleep last night because I was so worried about this event, and I hoped I was able to support Ben accordingly.

How would I react if things don't go to plan? We have spent so much money and time on this. We got there around 6 am; traffic was shockingly less than expected! The parking lot was full already, but we managed to grab a space thanks to someone leaving. We remembered to take everything along we needed: costume, skates, snacks.

Tony, my husband, was exhausted and suffering from a cold. My older son, S, was not thrilled about attending this event and wanted to go home. I was hoping I could bribe him to enjoy things by saying he could pick where we ate dinner. Ben was excited and not even remotely nervous. I was a wreck but pretending to be fine!

Ben got into costume around 7 am, practice ice went well, and he seemed happy and content. We then saw the kids he would be competing against and felt a pang of nerves. How could this little kid compete against kids much bigger and stronger than him? He did not seem fazed at all.

Another boy and his family were there, but they were not remotely friendly. They kept glaring at us, which made me feel irritated and also nervous. One of Ben's friends, a little girl, skated and did okay but did not win; she came 4th in her event. This made me worry for Ben and start telling myself this whole trip was a waste of money.

It was time for Ben to skate, and we all held our breath. He did an amazing job, and we were not sure if it was good enough to win, but it was good. Ben's coach said, ""he has got this, he will win,"" and we waited for the scores, trying to not get too excited. The scores took forever to be announced, but when they were, sure enough, he had won!

It was time to calm down and congratulate the other skaters on their skates and try to not appear too boastful. We waited for the medal ceremony but heard nothing. We then had the medal ceremony, which was incredibly rewarding, and then the event was over!

We were exhausted and went home. And it was still only 10:30 am!",3,154,491
"There used to be this pizza place in India called Pizza Corner, and they had this special dish called a Koniza, which is basically a pizza wrapped into a cone. And it was one of my favorite things to get from that restaurant. And the Konisa is not available widely anymore, mostly because they just don't sell it anymore at Pizza Corner. So I hope that they bring it back someday because that's one of the things I really enjoyed for my childhood in India.","A few months back, my birthday was approaching. My birthday is toward the end of the month of April. However, this was early in the month. I had finished work, and my wife had asked me to get ready because we were going to dinner together. Our children were ""at the babysitter"" (that's what I was told). So, I quickly dressed. I really did not want to leave, but I was hungry.

What I did not know is that my wife had gathered my family together for a surprise birthday party at O'Charley's. We arrived at about 5:30 pm. When we entered the ""party section"" of the restaurant, everyone shouted, ""Surprise."" I really was taken aback. I wondered why we were headed back to that section in the first place! I didn't expect that my wife would actually do something like that. She is sweet, but not much of one on surprises.

On top of my wife's surprise, everyone in my family was there. Some had traveled a few hours to be with us on that evening. It meant the world to me to have my family and a few friends come out to celebrate my birthday with me.",4,94,237
"Yeah, so when I first started grad school, actually throughout college for undergraduate and graduate school, I didn't do a very good job of balancing my time between exercising, doing schoolwork, and making time for my friends. And I think it's an ongoing process of improving, but I think I've gotten better over the past few years because lately, I've been doing a good job of making sure I go to the gym and do exercise, and also getting my work done and being organized. And I also do make time for my friends. It's not a lot of time, but I still do make time. So I think it's a work in progress, but I've gotten way better at managing my time in the last five or six years.","I was hired at my job just over 3 months now, and didn't really start working and getting hours until mid-late April, due to some bureaucracy issues and the fact that our new contract start date was delayed.

Since being hired, I have taken additional responsibilities and have added efficiencies for the workflow such as creating excel calculation sheets to help eliminate human error and making our forms more user-friendly (improvements which were then approved by our governing government agencies). I was not asked to do these things, yet I saw improvements to be made and wanted to make things easier for everybody.

Despite these measurable achievements, as well as becoming a go-to person for coworker questions, and even helping train experienced coworkers on this new contract, I still experience imposter syndrome.

So, in our handbook it says that we are to have a performance review 3-6 months after hire date. My 3 months came this month, and I reached out to my boss to get a performance review on the calendar for yesterday.

This whole week I've been anxious. Preparing my points to request a raise, trying to figure out how much of a raise to ask for, and how to go about asking. Worrying that asking for a $5/hr raise might be too much.

Well, I started the meeting and right off the bat, my boss says she's glad I reached out to schedule because she has been wanting to schedule with me to discuss some new positions available. She discussed the position said would like to just promote me and not have to post the job first, but has to check with HR.

I am happy to finally have a boss that can see and acknowledge my achievements and hard work in the workplace. Unfortunately, I think my last boss really did a number on my work self-esteem. But, I am so happy to be at a place where I can see myself continuing to advance while being recognized, and in my early 20's, too.",4,152,377
"So, story from my childhood. There's a lot. I grew up in Ohio, and it's a funny place to grow up. I remember playing in the backyard a lot, of sports and stuff. We used to always go down to Myrtle Beach for vacation, with some of my friends from the neighborhood. I think a lot about those times and just kind of growing up in the Midwest is interesting. Part in the early 90s. It's an interesting time, interesting place to grow up mostly good, mostly good, but just what a life.","I grew up in a town of about 7,000 people. Not the smallest around but definitely pretty small. Not quite the case of everyone knowing everyone, but news got around pretty fast. I remember so many nights just looking up at the stars and marveling at how many there were. In a way, I can really appreciate the story from the Bible when God tells Abraham to look up at the stars and he tells him that his descendants will be the number of the stars.

I can appreciate it even more now that it has been taken away from me. I now live in a city of 2 million, and the stars are just so washed out by light pollution that I think I'm lucky if half a dozen break through the pollution.

It genuinely excited me the other day when I could see Jupiter shining bright as it reached its closest point with Earth. But then I felt a moment of melancholy. I realized just how much I miss seeing those uncountable stars.

I miss my hometown. More than I'd ever admit to my parents, but I definitely miss it.",1,111,210
"Sure. So, I was thinking while I was at the park about how when I grew up, I grew up with my father primarily, and he didn't really know how to talk to me or communicate with me, but we spent a lot of time playing. Sports, playing games, playing with toys, just kind of like playing outside. And he always took me to play, and he was always kind of physically there, not very in touch, but always kind of demanding that I play. It made it a little less fun because he was a coach and very into sports. And so, it was kind of not as fun as I think he intended, but one thing that I am grateful for is that he always did play with me. He was always there to play with me, and that's how he kind of knew how to connect with me, just playing all the time. The first things I can remember playing, like fast feet, fluffy little games on the sidewalk, things like that. So, I'm grateful that that's how we connect with me. But sometimes I wish that he would have had more of an expanded kind of toolkit in terms of how to connect and interact and kind of be there. So, I think about that, both grateful for that and it's both challenging. It's challenging to connect with him today because that's all he knew. That's all he knows is kind of like exercise and play.","This week, my son started first grade. He is the youngest of all my children and the only boy. He was in kindergarten last year, and that was hard for me as well, as I had to come to terms with the fact that he was growing up and wasn't my little baby anymore. However, it was only kindergarten, so he still felt like a ""baby"" to me.

This year, however, he is noticeably older and more grown-up. As he walked down the street towards the bus on his first day of first grade, he looked like a ""big kid"" instead of my little baby. It made me both happy and sad. As he is becoming such a wonderful young man, yet at the same time, my little baby no longer is little. (This is also evident as his clothes from last year are too small. Last year, they were too big.)

Most surprisingly, he wasn't scared or nervous this year. At the start of kindergarten last year, he cried and begged me to stay home. I really wanted to keep him home as well! This year, he didn't cry for me or try to run back home for another hug. I was glad he was feeling more independent, but part of me wished he needed me more.

My little man is growing up so fast. I wish I could turn back the time and keep him my baby forever. Although I cannot, he will still always be ""mama's baby"".",5,291,297
"Cool. So today, I was looking at photos of some friends. It was a friend's birthday today, and I was looking at photos from maybe ten years, from 2006 to probably 2014. Gosh, I don't know, ten to 2014. I guess maybe somewhere around there. Anyways, I was just thinking about how my friends and I used to go hike in college and just have fun and build forts. We were already old, but it was still fun to do that. And I was sending some photos to some other friends, and I was just thinking about a vacation that we went on in high school. That was wild and fun. And it was just interesting to see photos of us from when we were younger. And it made me think of how young we were and how young I was and how much we've all grown. And we look different and we were different. We were closer friends then, and now we're all grown up. And some of my friends are lawyers, and I work in artificial intelligence. And it was just interesting to look back on those photos today and back on photos throughout my life. But particularly on the photos of my friends. It's nice, I guess, to remember being so close to those people, even though we were all young and it was messy and we weren't responsible adults, emotionally or in any other way. But it was nice to be so close with my friends during those years past.","My music taste has definitely changed as I grew up, but there are a few songs that always invoke feelings of nostalgia when time was much more peaceful and enjoyable. One of these songs is called ""Bubbly"" by Colbie Caillat, and I heard it playing today at Trader Joe's while I was buying some groceries. It was such a weird and nostalgic experience, and I stuck around even after I paid to listen to the full thing play out. 

I remember being in kindergarten, where we had a designated ""nap time,"" and the teacher would always play this song softly in the background. I remember being picked up by mom and going to get a snack after school with this song playing on the radio. 

It was so weird realizing that all of this happened and is a part of me, and I know that sounds really dumb, but it's just grounding to notice how far you've come with everything. I'm now in college away from that easy-going life of a little kindergartner, where all I had to worry about was what outdoor game me and my friends would play or what fun things I would do with my family over the weekend. 

It's just crazy to me how times change, but at the end of it all, I'm still me. It's even more crazy to me how just a simple 3-minute song made me have so many thoughts at the same time.",1,292,273
"Yeah, so I was talking with my father last night, and he was repeating himself a lot. And he mentioned about that his wife is concerned about his cognitive decline in terms of dementia. And some of my earlier memories were with my grandfather, his father, who had Alzheimer\'s, and he lived in our house. And it was pretty brutal to see him losing his mind. But I told my father that I don\'t think that it\'s related to Alzheimer\'s or Dementia. I think he literally just debate intellectually or emotionally, like most people do. He doesn\'t have conversations with people about their lives. He doesn\'t like participating in social events. He doesn\'t ask questions to learn about people. He never really wanted to do anything or participate in any ways. He doesn\'t know how to use a computer. You can\'t buy a plane ticket. He can\'t travel alone. He doesn\'t know how to manage his finances. He doesn\'t manage his finances. He doesn\'t really do anything. So in my opinion, his lack of participation and cognitive processes and general kind of life interest is really kind of a self-fulfilling process of his cognitive decline. There are plenty of people I know that are far older than him that really love learning or cooking or reading or hiking or exploring different ways to kind of nurture what they enjoy to do and kind of stay active and healthy in their lives in that way. But really, the only thing that my father likes to do is to sit on the couch, go jogging, and drink beer. And it\'s been that way for his whole life. Yeah, that\'s just been on my mind. And it\'s annoying to hear him say, like, ""Oh, jamie\'s worried about me."" But really, in my opinion, it\'s the result of his personal preferences and behaviors and limitations.","I had cancer as a kid, and so I grew up with that being sort of the centerpiece of my life. I was told I couldn't do certain things because of that. And I certainly felt like it made a pretty big impact on my life growing up because it colored everything for me.

When I got out of the hospital, it colored every single bit of my life because I couldn't get insurance. They wouldn't let me play sports, they wouldn't let me in the military. So it was a downer.

In other ways, I just looked at it like no, I will achieve. The thing that I always share with people is think about your own thing, what it is you love, and a way to make it into a life.

I just think there are lots of people who don't ever really achieve; they sort of surrender. And I've been at that place too, where you surrender. You don't do what you're passionate about.

And then 20 years from now, you're like, man, I didn't do what I really loved. For me, it's always thinking about how can you do something that you really love doing as a business?

And so I look at the entrepreneur track as being a really viable one for lots of people.",5,360,258
"Yeah. So, a story that I thought of was my father texted me pictures from Google Maps of the old apartment that we used to live in. And he was like, ""I love that. That was the greatest of times. People love talking to you because you could talk like an adult. And your grandmother helped us out so much."" And I didn\'t really have great memories of that time in my life or talking to anyone. So, yeah, it was just interesting to talk about those differences. I asked him if he had a plan for us to move into a house or anything like that. And he said no, that he was just trying to kind of get by to make sure that we had everything that we needed. So, that was just an interesting conversation about my past. Yeah.","About four months ago, my wife and I sold our first family home. We have a large family. It is my wife and I, plus five children. Our oldest daughter started asking us about having her own room. Although we loved that house, we knew it was time to get something bigger. 

Luckily, we sold it after being on the market for only three days. We found a house with more bedrooms quickly, and the whole process was as smooth as it could have been. 

However, it is bittersweet looking back on everything. That house was very special to me. I did a lot of work on it. I saw my children grow and learn and love there. We made so many good memories. We charted how our children grew on a closet door (which is probably still there). It was a wonderful house while it lasted, but things happen and we had to let it go. 

As of today, I can still remember every little nook and cranny of that place. After all, it has only been a few months. However, it is sad to think these memories will eventually fade. 

I love our new house, but that first one will always hold a special place in my heart.",1,162,241
"Yeah, I had like a really good learning from a friend, well, acquaintances really, at a bar. And essentially, there\'s two acquaintances, friends. One is named John Ross and the other is named Alfred. John Ross is like 39 and Alfred\'s 89. And Alfred leaned over to me and he asked me a question. And he said, ""Are you happy?"" And I said, ""Sometimes."" And he said, ""Well, that makes sense because happiness can be like that."" And he said, ""More importantly, are you content?"" And I said, ""Very recently, I\'ve become content."" And he said, ""You are with your life where your life has gone. Are you content with where you are and all that?"" And I said, ""Yes, I\'m very content, very recently."" And that was a great learning. And we talked about it for a little while, and people seem to really latch onto that. And it was an amazing kind of shared experience.","In those days, if you wanted to go into certain professions and you were a woman and you weren't of a certain class, then you started as a secretary. But at some point during that year, I said okay, you've got to try and figure out. This doesn't have to be your life's work. Just figure out what you want to do next. 

And I thought really carefully about what gave me joy in my own life. What was meaningful to me in my own life. I loved to read, and I loved the power of words. Their power to educate, inform, transform. 

I would encourage you to make your own luck. The greatest gift in life is making new discoveries. People talk a lot about he's lucky, she's lucky. A lot of it comes from luck. But a lot of the time you can make that luck yourselves. 

People love to connect, they love to help you. Remember that.",2,210,190
"Recently, as I've become more, I guess instead of gotten to know my friends more, and the more we've been through and the more conversations we have, and the more people I've met through their lives, and yeah, just the more time I've spent with them, I've just really gained appreciation for them, and for their friendship. And that's kind of unique to feel like a true appreciation that you found some really good friends.","Today, I saw photos and videos of old friends spending time together, and I don’t know why it still hurts after all this time, but it does. They’re so close to each other, and they just look so happy.

They were like the older counterpart to my friend group in school, and they were always welcoming and good to me. I know I was happy there, and I wish I was still connected to that group and to my own.

Those are the people I grew up with and should have graduated with, and the people I should have gotten to see every time I came home from college, but now I’m living in a completely different state from them.

It’s been years, and I should be over this by now, but somehow I still haven’t moved on.",1,91,164
"Okay. So, today, I wanted to have a doughnut, and I went to the donut shop. And the lady there gave me two donuts for the price of one. So, that was very nice because I got two donuts.","I had a presentation to do today, and I hate public speaking with a passion. I think I did well, but it still was nerve-wracking. I ended up going to the dollar store with my mom after class, and there was this very kind cashier there. I wanted to make her happy because that makes me happy (and I needed it after today) and because she seemed so sweet, I asked her what her favorite chocolate bar was ""because I wasn't sure what to get.""

She said Wunderbar, so I went and got 2. I told her no bag. She asked if I wanted a receipt, so I said no thanks, and slid one of the Wunderbars across the counter towards her and said, ""and you can have one.""

Her face instantly lit up even behind her mask, and she was so thankful. It cost me $0.82 to make someone happy for a day, and that just made my entire day better. Everything I did today, including the presentation, led me to meeting this kind woman and giving her a smile (and a Wunderbar).

It just feels great. I hope she enjoyed her chocolate. It really made me feel good seeing her eyes light up like that!",5,47,242
"Hello. Yesterday, I found out that my partner won't be able to visit me here in the US, and that made me very sad because I was looking forward to seeing them, spending some time together, and being comforted by that. So now, I'm despondent.","I'm moving provinces to be with my partner who I know for sure is so good for me, and I know this will be a positive experience and the beginning of a life I've always wanted. But I'm leaving my sister and her family behind, who I've been close with since always. She has two daughters that feel like my own children, and I haven't been away from them any longer than a couple weeks at a time.

I'll be driving 30 hours with my dog. It's not really like me to be so nervous and emotional, but I guess all my past new experiences always had an end date.",5,55,126
"Hello. So, I was at the library, and I ran into a friend whom I hadn't seen since high school. And that was great. We went out to have some coffee. But I forgot what I had gone to the library for in the first place, which was to work on an assignment. So, I turned that in late.","I was like, ""I could just die. I don't have time doing something I'm not excited about."" So I quit my job and went back to school. I was a literature major, and I decided I wanted to be an engineer. 

And so, I started with pre-algebra, algebra, all from the bottom up. I think in our society, from a very early age, it's sort of you're humanities or you're hard science. 

And that's not true. You can do both.",4,70,103
"Today, I had dinner with a new friend, and I really enjoyed it. I think it makes me feel a bit more at home to find friends that I really click with.","I recently reconnected with a former love of mine. We had a falling out a very long time ago, and recently ran into each other at the neighborhood Raley's. She just moved back into the city a few months ago. It was very surprising to me that I ran into her.

She has really beautiful blue eyes, but my favorite part about her is her personality. I'm usually not too great with jokes, but she tends to laugh at most of my dumb ones. We have both changed very much, but it was for the better.

Now that we have reconnected, I'm feeling better than ever. We went out to the movies last week and got some dinner after. The restaurant we went to was right down the street at Tahoe Joe's. I got whiskey peppercorn chicken, and she got a fancy salad of some kind.

We went back to my place and started watching Amazon's new show, ""The Boys"". We really enjoyed it (or at least I think she did). It was very memorable, and I hope to have more memories like this in the future.

So far, it's going great, and I hope it can only get better!",1,36,235
"Are you listening? Right now, I guess I'll start. I'm not sure if you're listening, I guess. The two most meaningful stories we can start out with, from the beginning. I can tell you the story of my adoption. I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and at about the age somewhere between eight to 15 months, I was abandoned on post office steps. And then, I'm assuming taken to a local orphanage. At about 21 months, the adoption was arranged for my family, which I'm very lucky to have, but I'll go back into a little more detail of my adoption.\n\nFrom what I know, I was abandoned on post office steps and then taken to an orphanage. And then, my family was tracked down. I was told that my birth father was deceased and my birth mother couldn't take care of me. After they had contacted my family, my birth uncle tried to take me and take care of me, but that also he just couldn't handle it. And so then I was finally released for the adoption process. So, at about 21 months, I came over to the United States to my current loving, loving family. I feel very fortunate and I never kind of felt empty inside about the whole adoption. I get a little emotional just talking about it because honestly, it feels very surreal. I've always had a very loving family and so there's nothing that I should be feeling bad about. I was lucky to have my parents have two biological children, John and Betsy. They're about eight and nine years older than me, so I was definitely the baby of the family, but I never grew up feeling different. In fact, sometimes I joke that I'm just a white girl, which might seem a little derogatory, but I have never felt different or undervalued in my life. Well, from this, if anything, I feel very blessed and fortunate to have landed where I did and all the immense opportunities that have been before me. I really, honestly couldn't feel luckier about the family that I had.","I grew up in Nanjing, China. When I was a baby, I lost my right leg in a fire. Shortly after that, I was abandoned on the street. I was found at a year and a half old and taken to the local government orphanage. Fortunately for me, I was adopted when I was seven years old and came here to the states.

When I was 14 years old, I received a running prosthetic. The day that I ran, I remember it being one of the most traumatizing days of my whole life. That was the first time that I was gonna have to be out. I was gonna have to show people that this is who I am, that I couldn't hide, that I was an amputee.

I got out there and I started running and I realized I love to do this. This is so liberating. This is so freeing because I am out and this is who I am.

I don't think you ever get one moment, have one experience, and you totally accept everything about who you are. That's a lifelong journey. But the start of that is finding something that allows you to be you.",4,415,230
"It's not an Astoria that happened recently. It's a story in my past. And the strongest emotion I felt here was shame. It was when I was in fifth grade. That's a time in adolescence when you're pudgy and awkward. And I remember being the target of bullying, where people were mooing at me, and I just felt absolutely terrible. And the teachers had to intervene. That's not even the real shame part that I feel. The shame part that I feel is that a week later there was another young girl that was the target of the same bullying, and I participated in it. Because now looking back, I guess I just really wanted to be a part of the group. And so I joined in. And I just feel absolutely terrible about having made somebody else feel the same way that I did.","I'm a teenage girl in my junior year of high school. As a kid, someone I trusted took advantage of me, and it took me until I was 14 to realize that it wasn't my fault. This was someone that was older than me by 5 years and knew what he was doing. I didn't, and he tricked me into doing things I deeply regret now.

I'm still struggling now with this realization because for the longest time I tried to convince myself it didn't even happen. It has made me scared of guys and their intentions. Fear spikes in my chest whenever a guy tries to befriend me. I'm terrified for my friends when they like guys because I'm scared they'll be hurt by someone. I don't ever voice that to them because I know it's irrational, but it's obvious I'm uncomfortable and that bothers them.

I wish this didn't impact my life so much. I feel bad for immediately assuming every guy is dangerous, but I can't help it. I don't know what to do about it.

This also impacts my relationships with my female friends because I avoid spending time with them when they're around guys. I haven't told them why I'm like this because it feels like I'm overreacting.

There are guys I'm friends with, but they're not close to me. They're online friends that I play video games with. I don't have in-person guy friends.

I don't feel like I have a right to feel this way because there are women out there who went through worse, yet they don't struggle the way I do.",1,166,320
"I\'ll do a part two to my adoption story, something that surfaced when I was about 25 years old and so quite a while after my adoption. I took a graduate study and we traveled to Korea, and it was my first time back to Seoul, South Korea. Since, basically since my adoption. And I don\'t know if I\'ve had that many emotions running through me at any other point in my life, but it was just such a blend of elevated highs of feeling connected and just moments of pure peace, to the other extreme of extreme disruption with who I identified with what I had thought I was up until that point. I even took a little medallion that I had, that was from when I came over, that had the name of my orphanage and I had a cab driver take me there. And I saw all the little kids that were there. And then they showed me a picture of myself that I had never seen before. And it completely threw me into a complete unraveling. I had panic attacks for a good two weeks plus after that, where I couldn\'t breathe. I didn\'t know who I was, where I was supposed to be going. And it took a long time for me to kind of situate myself back to ""I am a blend of everything. I\'m not just one or the other."" I don\'t have to feel guilty or wondering about my birth family and where they are. But it really did take a long time for me to calm down my emotions, so I wasn\'t having panic attacks anymore. And I still feel like it has a bit of a ripple effect.","When you have something called a learning disability, even that language is not the right language. Everything that transcends from it is like anything I get is a mistake, every accomplishment that I achieve, I didn't achieve them because I have this disability thing.

As someone with a learning disability, I wanted to be done with that. So when I got into college, I actually thought somehow wrapped into that acceptance was a cure. I'm good, I never need to talk about that again, it's not who I am.

And when I got to Brown, thankfully, I quickly forgot that idea. I realized I didn't want to be alone, that's a very lonely way to feel. I started taking education classes, and I learned that one in five people learn and think like I do. Where are they? Like, I don't see them.

I realized the only way I can find them is that I had to start leading with my story. There are two possibilities in the future for our people. One is that we don't tell our story, and then we live in this place of shame and we're misunderstood, and much of our potential is lost.

The second possibility is the one I'm really excited about. It's that idea that by sharing our stories and associating our other gifts and talents with that part of how our brains work, we could unlock something that's amazing for all of us.",1,319,283
"Yeah, I guess this is more a recent kind of thing that I\'ve been mulling through in my head. I have a really good friend who\'s been a good friend for the past few years. And recently, she\'s just been so negative. Actually, not recently, for a while now she\'s been so negative. And then I can\'t help but also feel negative. And then it also feels as if she\'s starting to be negative towards me. And so my initial reaction, and this is a problem of mine, is to just say, ""alright, screw it. She\'s not a very good friend. Don\'t need to invest time there."" But I also think that it\'s really worthwhile to have strong friendships. I just sometimes get really disappointed with my friend\'s behavior. Or I tend to see that they\'re very selfish. And I don\'t really know what to do about it because I do think it\'s worthwhile building and working on it. And so sometimes I almost think it\'s almost like a marriage. It\'s like you talk things through and work through it. But the other side of me is kind of like, ""there\'s just not enough time in the day to worry about unhealthy factors in my life.""","I made my girlfriend angry a few days ago. She ended up sending me a torrent of verbally abusive messages. Not wanting to deal with this treatment so late in the night, I stopped reading them. The next morning, they sent a message apologizing for their behavior. I took some time to take care of myself and accepted her apology a few hours later.

Our conflict seemed far from over, but it had only just begun. I was not in a great mood after the night before. As one could expect, I was just the least bit withdrawn and didn't want to talk to them much. This caused her to get paranoid, defensive, and triggered another torrent of angry, abusive behavior from her.

What ensued was a fight where she said she would break up with me. Eventually, I would have enough and called her out on her behavior. This only caused her to get more angry. She told me I was like an abusive parent. The next couple of hours were little more than narcissistic projection on her part. I was dumbfounded by her blatantly abusive and manipulative behavior.

In the end, she told me she wouldn't actually leave, but that she needed to 'take me down to my knees.' In her mind, she was knocking me off my high horse. Since then, I have slowly grown to lose my feelings towards her. I will likely break up with her the next time this happens.",1,248,280
"I don't know if it's interesting. I'm kind of gearing more towards emotional triggers in my storytelling. I guess this one is going to be about having to work with a really aggressive coworker and kind of working through how to handle it. So I have a product manager who is, I can flat out say, the most aggressive teammate I've ever had to deal with. And I've had a broad range of collaboration with various stakeholders. The way that I started to handle it was first to kind of be overly appeasing and make sure that she felt included. Then it just kind of continued, this perpetual sort of notion of resentment towards me, which I'm not really sure where that's founded in. I think it's kind of just she just had something she didn't like about me and she just brought it to a personal level rather than keeping it professional. I definitely tried to have heart-to-hearts with her and it seemed on the surface that everything was fine. But it's really just constant and perpetual sort of condescending tones, outright aggression, and honestly, very childish behavior. And I'm not really sure at this point, and I think the outcome is just that thankfully the teams have shuffled and I shouldn't have to have any overlap with her, which is probably the best resolution to this situation. I've definitely brought it up to my boss, my manager, and he's fully aware of it. It's just that we have such a limited fund and appetite for going out and hiring new people. We definitely don't want to have a churn with our internal teammates. So honestly, the only resolution is to basically not have to overlap her with her in work.","I made my girlfriend angry a few days ago. She ended up sending me a torrent of verbally abusive messages.

"This is going to be a very empowering story. This is a moment in time in my life when I was crossing and driving into Savannah right before I was about to start grad school. So the backstory of all of this is, I was about 35 years old. I had a four-year-old, I had a job, and I just needed a career path change, so I quit my job and took some time off and decided to go back to school. The difficult time was that we lived in New Jersey, and we were deciding to go back to school, or I was going back to school in Savannah. So we had to plan this massive move. First off, it was just a big life change with having a house and a mortgage and figuring out who was going to rent that. Having a child that I had to figure out where he was going to go to preschool and daycare, and then not to mention my husband relocating too and finding a new job. It was just so much. Sometimes it was unbearable. I just kept telling myself, ""One step at a time, sell one piece at a time,"" and just little incremental steps to get us there. And so the moment in my life that was just really resounding and echoes, and I just remember it forever, was that moment when we were driving into Savannah, had the cars all packed up, all committed, got everything done. And we are driving over there\'s this large bridge that leads into Savannah, and it just has such a great view. And that moment of entering into town was just a moment of no fear and full empowerment.","I was home three days a month. I was old and tired and cranky. I made over six figures, I flew first-class. I couldn't be bought for money anymore, I decided. And about six months after I resigned, I adopted the most adorable Weimaraner puppy, and I brought Gabriel to the Crisis Nursery for their Christmas party.

What we saw in those kids changed my life forever because those little boys that were mean and nasty and violent, they became soft and loving and gentle. This is an amazing thing that happened, that I was able to do this.

I think you know when it's the right time, and it's revealed to you. And the whole time, you can't be bitter about the fact that it hasn't been revealed to you yet. You make the best, happiest life you can make. It's a journey.

I didn't find out until I was 42 years old what I wanted to do with my life. Forty-two! I think people could find what they wanted, what their passion is, at 60.",2,322,209
"This isn't really a story as much as just a kind of state of emotions recently. I've been getting really overwhelmed. It just feels like one thing after another happens and nothing's really big. It's really just coming down, I guess, to like money, stress, and just having to deal with life's little hiccups that it throws at you. I've had my car in the shop for a month, and I'm looking at, I'm $1000 in, I'm looking at another $2000. Our plumbing just backed up this morning. I just feel like I'm getting really overwhelmed by little kind of human condition life stuff. No, this isn't human condition. It's more just like little incidents with life that sometimes I really just don't know how to handle it. And I just want to shut down and go into my bed, under the covers, and just shut out the world for a good week. And I feel as if there are probably healthier ways to deal with this.","I've been in a bad way for a while. Progressively worse lately. Depressed, stressed to the point of breaking, feeling lost, and more hopeless than I've been in ages.

But today, I woke up, went to a spa, and got a massage - a birthday present to myself to hopefully ease over sore muscles.

In the quiet, my mind would typically wander to every way I've messed up in the last few years, things I've already messed up for the future, overthinking and overanalyzing everything I've ever done or will do.

Instead, I forced my mind to build this whole ridiculous scenario about what was happening and why I was there, like I was reading or living in some kind of story. My mind did wander to stressful stuff some, but I would scold myself and repeat the story-building in my mind.

So, instead of laying in bed all day, going over and over the things that have been weighing on me heavily lately like I have been, I took a step out of my brain and simply allowed myself to relax, even if I had to focus on it a little.

My body feels more relaxed, my neck isn't nearly as stiff and has probably popped 20 times since I left, and I don't feel like I'm going to suffocate in the silence tonight.

For however long this lighter feeling lasts, I have to call this a win.",1,203,276
"I guess recently, I don't know if I've been talking about the lack of security at my job because we're a venture-backed kind of product company. And so, we really kind of rely on outside financing to help support our growth and development. And so, there's been a lot of uncertainty now with this last venture capitalist backing, investment opportunity, whether or not our company is going to survive. And so, I've been dealing a lot with the nervousness about job security. And so, I've actually reached out to my friend who works at another product design company. And there's a really great potential opportunity over there. And so, I guess the thing that I would like to talk to you about is sometimes I feel like I'm my own worst enemy. I already kind of weigh the balances, which I guess is normal, but at the same time sometimes I already talk myself out of opportunities before I even jump into them because I'm weighing all the outcomes and seeing outcomes that probably don't even exist. And maybe just looking for reasons not to lean into something. And so, I definitely struggle with this. It sounds perfect and great, but it's kind of a whole 100% remote, and so, I just already have predetermined in my mind that for the rest of my life, I'm going to be working at home in my office by myself. And I shouldn't just talk myself out of good opportunities.","I was at Microsoft for five years and then did a bunch of different work in West Africa. I've taught school, I've been an urban planning associate. I've sold seeds door to door -- I think that was my first job. I think I was about six when I was doing that. I started off early with some of that entrepreneurial zeal.

Other people are really fortunate that they find something that just brings so many of their passions together, and I would encourage you to think about that and to try to construct that reality for yourself. You don't have to fit in these neat cubby holes.

"I'm going to tell you about a really, really, probably just magical moment in my life. And when I look back at one of the fondest times, that's the memory that comes right to the forefront. So the story is, I lived in Savannah for about four to three years, from 2016 to about 2019. And so my husband, child, and I used to go out to Tybee Island every weekend, all weekend. And it was just so liberating. There's an area where you can go, it's the Back River, where the Back River meets the ocean. And it just gets these tidal pools in low tide where you can go out. I'm not even exaggerating, a mile in just water that is only about ankle deep or knee deep, and it's warm, and you can see all these sea creatures. And there was just this one time that stands out. And it was just absolutely beautiful. We went all the way out to the edge, seriously probably about a mile out, and there's a breakpoint there, where there's a sandbar. And we went all the way out there and it was just a treasure trove of all these sand dollars. I remember those moments with me and my child and husband. And we saw one, and then we looked up and it was just covered in sand dollars. So we were just running around collecting as many sand dollars as we could. We were filling our hats and our buckets and anything we could use to hold the sand dollars. And it was so magical. And just the breeze and being out in the middle of nowhere, it felt like the edge of the Earth. And then on our way back, we were walking back towards the land, and this flock of pelicans just came right, just swooshed right past us. And I just closed my eyes and it's probably the most at peace I ever felt in my life. And I just try to go back and look at that moment. And I try to bring it back, almost meditative, at any time, even good times, bad times, or just quiet times. And I'm really trying to figure out how I can just find that utmost inner peace when, just in the future, whenever I just need those moments.","I recently went on a swimming trip with a group of friends. It was after a Sunday religious service we are all a part of on a hot summer day. We all arranged together how we would get there and where we were going. We drove in three separate cars. We arrived at an area of a river where there was a canal that had deep and slow moving water.

It was a short walk to the area, and we had to climb down a rocky ledge to reach it. I decided to go in fast while the others were tentative because of the cold water. When getting in, I scraped my arm on the rock I was holding while lowering myself. It made me feel rather clumsy, and then I started worrying about if it might get infected. I didn't make a big deal of it because I didn't want to ruin anyone else's time.

We all swam for a little while, then gathered in a shallow area and just sat and talked for a while. At one point, I decided to get up and explore some of the rocky area around the swimming hole. Being with the group was reminding me of times as a kid when I went swimming in these kinds of places with friends. It was making me sad that I don't do it that often anymore. So I felt that going off on my own and gathering my emotions would be best.

I walked around on the rocks and looked at the trees of the forest behind it. Then I found a spot in the shade and laid down for the remainder of our time there. A friend yelled up to me that we were leaving, so then we all climbed back up the ledge and got in the cars and left.",2,452,336
"Cool, great. So, I have been dealing with some pain - abdominal pain. So, I don't know if you really call that a story. It's been something I've been dealing with for the past several days - intermittent pain, but it's chronic, which is frustrating. But fortunately, that actually happened after that dinner party that I was just talking about. So, it was nice to be at the dinner party for the birthday - for the birthdays - and not have to be concerned with dealing with pain at the same time.","I wrecked my car last week on the way home from work. I got sent back to the hospital that I'm a nurse at, the ER treated me not so well, and I was there for 12 hours.

I broke my nose, bruised my face, my teeth went through my bottom lip and chin, and I had three compression fractures in my vertebrae making it very hard to move.

But that was 5 days ago, and I'm up and walking with my brace, showering, sleeping on my side, and I even walked down our two steps to check the mail!

I'm so proud of the progress I've made.",3,109,126
"Great. Like I just mentioned, I have a story to share. On my new prescription sunglasses that I just picked up in this amazing fuchsia-tinted lens, I bought the frames at Chanel, which I did not foresee myself doing, but I did. And then I bought another pair at Bulgari because I had all this money stuck in my FSA from my last job. So I took this pair of frames from Chanel to LensCrafters, and they put in, first, just a black prescription lens. But it was just so boring looking. It just looked like two black dots on my face. So I went back and decided to try out their pink tint, but it was too light, so I asked them to really saturate the color. And so I went away for a couple of weeks. And when I came back, it wasn't dark enough. So they took them back and said they can saturate it even more. And so now I have this crazy pair of fuchsia sunglasses. What do you call it? It's not bifocal. It's trifocal. But it's progressive. They're progressives. And they're nice progressives. So I've got this fun pair of sunglasses, the progressives, and I got another pair from Bulgari that they switched out for. It's like a gold frame. This is a black frame. This is like a sparkly, well, can you see it? It's sort of a sparkly black frame, like muted sparkle. Like not sequin, but just has a shimmer. And then I've got these crazy fuchsia lenses that they put inside them. And my first pair of custom-made prescription sunglasses. The whole thing. And then the other pair that I'm excited to get back soon are Bulgari. And those are like a gold frame with, what do you call it? It's a brown lens. But it does that fade where the bottom is a bit clear and transparent, and then it gets darker as it goes up the lens. Can't think of what it's called right now. Ombre. I don't know. Maybe it's ombre. I mean, they talk about that with other things, because you get peace, though. But anyway. Those also have that extra feature that a lot of sunglasses have where they block the light, the rays coming at you from a lot of different directions. But they're not as great for, say, digital screens like your phone. So I've got these crazy fuchsia ones now that are progressive. And I've got the other ones from Bulgari that will be progressive. And yeah, I'm just hooked up all of a sudden. The sunglasses.","We were rolling around selling T-shirts and we did that for five years. Along the way, we learned some things about what people liked and didn't like on shirts, but we weren't making a lot of money at all, just getting by. So we had decided that our label and our brand name was going to be something that already existed in people's minds in some way. ""Life is good"" was one of about 50 different slogans we put on an easel.

In the morning, we woke up and we tore ""Life is good"" off the page and we Scotch-taped it up on the wall. And then we stepped back and we said, ""Okay, now it's not just for artists. This is for anyone who sees the glass half full.""

Life goes by pretty quickly and you have to think about when you're old and gray. What will make you happy to look back and say, ""You did it""? What will be fulfilling? You gotta think through and say, ""What would be meaningful in my life?""",2,524,211
"I have a job interview coming up, and I had maybe 15 different recruiters reach out to me about it. A bunch were giving the same cap for what the company would pay. There's a contract rule, but it's Google and they can pay so much more. And I live in the heart of Boston. I mean, it's just silly. It's not just a typical research role, it's a team lead role. Anyway, so I got to deal with the recruiters and I don't know that's its own beast, but they're there to hopefully gain success through my success. So that's good. It's just sometimes you have to wonder how transparent they're being about budget. But it's a cool opportunity. A lot of competition for it, and it's contract. So I have mixed feelings about that. But then again, since I'm still not really sure my next direction, I should see where things take me. But I have to be discerning, otherwise I just pick up an available job. And that's not what I want. I like to pride myself in the opportunities I select. And hopefully girlfriend... Anyway, I'm needing to refresh myself in some of my old work because I have had so many different jobs, different projects that really vary but still within UX, user research, Psychology, perception, design research. Anyway, there are so many different directions I can take myself in the field still, which is exciting.","I just gave my 4th round of interviews and was pretty sure I wouldn't clear it, so I wasn't even nervous in the slightest. Went on call, the interviewer gave a problem and said we will try to solve it in 50 mins. I gave the most optimal solution in 7 mins. He was thoroughly impressed and told me this was a new record.

We wrapped up the one-hour interview in 20 mins. I have two more rounds before getting an offer.

I have a fever today and thought of postponing, but I've been giving interviews for this company for over a month now and didn't want to delay anymore. Will start preparing for the next round from tomorrow.

I've never been rejected in any interview in my life and thought this would be it, but I'm so lucky.",4,294,158
"I did a lot of swimming this past week. It's been really nice to take advantage of the pool at my mom's development while I'm visiting. It gives me a lot of agility in how I want to stretch and exercise, and I find it really nice. And then, it's also just a nice change of scenery. My mom and I have just been really enjoying the jacuzzi together as well. It's good for our circulation, and I think also, it's just really pleasant. That would have been nice.","We live in Canada, and sometimes the winters can get long. November is gloomy. December is usually cheerful just because of the holidays, good food, and people, and then it drags out with freezing temperatures, dark nights, and crappy driving conditions from January through April. I find I get sad around February since I'm just wishing for sunlight and for my face not to hurt when I go outside. 

We finally got a huge dump of snow, and my husband and I picked up our season passes and went snowboarding for the first time. Did I fall an insane amount? Yes. Were some of my wipeouts spectacular? Absolutely. Do I know what I'm doing? Not particularly. Am I in pain? My butt is so bruised, I'm looking like a plum. But man, did we have fun. 

When I first brought it up in October, my husband said he wanted to go with me, and I was thrilled. He's a bit of a homebody in the winter, so I was just excited to be able to share a sport with him. We bought all of our gear without even having tried the sport and just waited for the perfect time to go. 

We had so much fun, and I'm really looking forward to hitting the hills tomorrow and again later this week too! I get to spend quality time with him, we're being active, we're learning something new together, and we're spending time outdoors - it's the best of all the worlds combined. 

It's making the winter seem so much shorter since I'm actually wishing for winter to stay and more snow to hit. It really helped change my attitude on winter.",2,106,329
"I just got a really nice recommendation from a former colleague that he posted on my LinkedIn page. So, it was really nice to receive. A former colleague from a Boston consulting group. We worked together on virtual learning.","I knew that I wanted to get into tech somehow. But I wasn't sure which field, like mechanical engineering or computer science, and I was really good at math. So I'm like, okay, I wanna do something with math, I wanna explore programming. And that's how I started taking computer classes. And that's really how I came about choosing a direction.

So MINDBODY's mission is to leverage technology to improve the wellness of the world. And so I oversee what's called the data science team, and we do a lot of analyzing of data.

And so a lot of that has to do with just figuring out what the trends are, what kind of shifts we're seeing in the industry in terms of attendance. Are we seeing drops in attendance? Like, for example, people make their New Year's resolutions, right? You see attendance spikes on the first week of January. And then it levels off. We can see those things.

And so I feel like I'm one of the lucky ones who gets to actually work in the field that I got to focus on.",3,44,220
"Yeah, so I mean my story is really just starting about. Just sitting with my mom and catching up on some of the shows and just sort of laughing about how less amusing and engaging some of the shows are than we were remembering them to be, I think. We sort of got past the threshold of longing for them because I'd been over five months, I think. So I think they might have to earn a little bit of, well, I mean it was maybe short notice for them. I'm not sure. But earn a little bit of our consumer attention back with some good, funny, comedic writing. That'll be nice. It's slowly, I think, revving up.","Two things I loved: new media and audio. And it was very easy to get, and they were very easy to listen to. And it was always so passionate.

And so, Tom, who's also one of my best friends, we decided early on that we love doing podcasts. We love doing a show together. Let's start a new show based on this other thing we love, which is science fiction and fantasy.

It's so easy now to do, to get started in this industry. And I'm not saying it's easy to succeed in the industry, but the barrier to entry for doing podcasts, for doing online video, for doing a blog or an online magazine is so low.

The only advice I tend to ever give is, ""If you want to work in this field or do anything remotely like what I'm doing, start.""",4,139,173
"It's heartbreaking what's happening in the news right now, internationally. And it's painful to see different people's reactions. Social media.

It's heartbreaking to see how many people can go so low and be the worst in humanity.","I got shot in June 2007. I took a bullet side-to-side through the knee on a house raid, so it basically blew my knee out. Everything that I wanted to do or I wanted to be revolved around being a soldier. So I struggled. 

What do you see most on social media and on the news? You see PTSD, suicide, all these veterans struggling. That's the trendy story. But we need to change that rhetoric. 

Instead of talking about all these bad things, talk about the positive things. The things that we learn, that we are capable of that make us great. Instead of cowering from challenges, we learn to face our fears. We learn to face those obstacles and use those things we learned in the military to not just live in the civilian world but thrive.",2,74,157
"All right? So, my story is that I got to catch up with my friend today. It was really nice talking about different trips we've taken in the past, other trips we might want to take in the future, and also just finding out the best way to plan for taking a trip with her because she has a baby. I'm friends with her husband, but it's different when you're single and you're figuring out how to hang out with your friends, go on trips with them when they aren't single. And it makes sense this time of my life. I mean, I've got friends that have kids going to college. I've got friends that have kids they just had. And of course, people like myself, like I was just mentioning. But it was really good. So, the story is that I met up with her for lunch. And she was telling me also about how she's going through IVF right now to get pregnant again. And so, that was also really interesting because I've gone through my own process of trying to cryogenically freeze my own eggs, which I've done in the past after my husband passed away. So, I have some experience in that, not in the implanting stage, the fertilization stage. But she's having to inject all these hormones into her right now, and I've gone through that and can commiserate. It can change you not just physically, but mentally too. So, it's good we can share different past experiences, whether it's her experience going to Sedona, or my experience with IVF. Just a lot to talk about. A lot of different kinds of topics. And she's a fun friend to discuss a lot of different topics with.","My daughter and her husband were excited to announce this spring that they were expecting their second child. As a proud grandmother who provides daycare during the week for their first child, I was naturally thrilled.

My daughter is a special education teacher. She was very fortunate to have the summer months off from teaching while she was experiencing the tiredness and nausea that early pregnancy brings.

While on a weekend camping trip at the Missouri River several weeks ago, my daughter was frightened to discover that she was passing some blood. Her husband rushed her to the emergency room at the closest community.

They were immediately assisted by the on-call physician. He performed an examination and lab work and called in the on-call ultrasound technician. They were relieved to learn that she was not experiencing a miscarriage.

However, they were shocked to hear that ""BOTH"" babies appeared to be doing well and had good strong heartbeats! What a change in emotions! We all shifted from fear of the worst to the joy of upcoming TWINS!

We are all feeling blessed with the good news. I am now preparing for the upcoming role as a grandma daycare provider of twin babies and a two-year-old!

Our family is so blessed with our exciting news. We can hardly wait to learn the genders of the twins so that we can begin preparing for their arrival.",4,345,254

And I want to start looking at the details of the trip, like things to do with Sedona, things to do at the Grand Canyon. But I\'ve got one more week left of this work to do for this course. So, I\'m deciding whether I\'m going to try to cram it all in before I fly out, or more likely, cram it all in afterwards. But I\'m excited to go out there. It\'ll be a lot of sunshine. And when I booked the tickets, I had to book a red eye. Because it was so last minute. But it was worth it. But those fees, they slam on those fees. It\'s very confusing. The total includes one check bag. And they show you one price on that screen that says, ""The total includes one check bag."" So, you think that\'s the total. But then you go to another page and they meant the total on the other page includes the check bag. So, there are so many ways that you can confuse consumers. But anyway, it\'s all set, and I\'m excited, and I\'m excited that my friend is going to meet me out there. So, I\'ll get more family time and I\'ll get to see a friend I haven\'t seen in a while. And that\'ll be great.","To celebrate my retirement earlier this year, my husband and I went on a cruise to Alaska. We left out of Seattle, Washington. We live in New York and had to fly across the country. It was the first time we were both on an airplane, and it was both exciting and nerve-wracking as we were flying in the same day the ship was leaving Seattle.

We arrived at Seattle with no delays and met our transport at the airport. It was approximately a 30 to 45-minute ride to get to the ship. I'll never forget the sight of the ship - it was so much bigger than I could have imagined. We had to wait a little while to board the ship, and there was not much to do...but finally, we were able to board.

The ship was so large - like a little city. We found our room, dropped off some stuff, and then went to get some food. They were serving burgers and fries at one of the eateries. We waited in line; there were a lot of people. The food was not great, but we figured it was due to the number of people being served, and they were rushing to serve as many as possible. The food throughout the cruise was hit and miss...but mostly very good. At least, if we did not like something, we could go back and get something else.

The cruise was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. We got to see so much beautiful scenery, and we had 4 stops on land. Glacier Bay was spectacular, a sight I will never forget. We saw glaciers calving...it was awesome. The trip was an experience I will never forget.",3,311,325
"So this is a story of how my mom and dad got married. So they have this super cute love story that I wish I also will have, can have these, but who knows. Basically, my mom and my dad grew up on the same little street in the same little, tiny farming fishing village in China. There were just a few houses apart. My mom is two years older than my dad, but I swear from birth, he fell in love with her. She was like class star, like class President, amazing role model, like most beautiful girl ever. And she always saw him as a younger brother figure. So he would follow her around, make dumb jokes and stuff, but I think she also kind of liked them a little bit enough. But eventually, my dad's family immigrated to the US first. So he left when he was... I don't know when, twelve, I think. And then for the next six years, they never really saw each other because he was in America. She was in China back then. Transportation between the two countries not as available, not as economical. But he would write letters back. And I think he just always kept loving her, despite not really seeing her for that time period. And eventually, when he got into College, he deferred a semester and went back to China. And he said that the first person he saw when he went to the village was my mom. And he just knew. Felt all the time with her. And then he basically just asked her to come to America with him, eventually marry him. Obviously, why else would she go to America with him if not to marry him? So my mom, she agreed. During the whole time, she never dated anyone. My maternal grandma, My lala, was very strict. Like, no dating boys. No seeing boys. And my dad never dated anyone. So they were each other's first kiss, like first everything. And I think that's just something so beautiful. Very bold of my mom, very brave of her to put down all her roots and then pick them up and then move them all to America to be with my dad. So I'm grateful for it because I got to grow up in America and have a lot of opportunities. I might not have had if I grew up in China. I got married when my dad was 20, my mom was 22. And they've been married for so long now, super cute. They've been married for over 30-something years. And I think that is something that I really admire. And even though I can't get married that early, I wish I could, I still hope that I will find someone sometime soon, maybe. But yes, that is the story of how my mom fell in love, got married, and then I think they had six years of marriage before they had me. And I think that's also really nice to have, little marriage time when you're just you and your spouse before kids, these other responsibilities. But yeah, that is my story for the session. Thank you, Jibo.","I was part of a military family. We moved a lot. I went to ten schools before I got out of high school. My family and the military community around us were part of my life. And also the Catholic church.

At that time, for girls, the idea was if you weren't just gonna be a mom and a mother, there were really very few things you could do. You could be a nurse. You could be a teacher. And in my background, you could be a nun. I very quickly decided I wasn't gonna be a nun.

I was 17. I'm just looking at the next four years. When I became involved in the Young Lawyers here in Denver, I certainly did not think that 28 years later I would become the president of the ABA.

If you have passion for something, there's not such a thing as a 40-hour work week. I don't think I've ever done a 40-hour work week. Because I have so much fun doing what I do, it's just part of my life.",5,625,211
"So this past weekend, I went to my first wedding ever. And it was so fun. The groom was my peer mentor, so he was one of the people who introduced me to MIT, to the dorm we were living in. He took care of me and the friends I went with. And, the bride was someone also in my year but, like, one year younger in age. They met through shared interests and it was just super touching. Their ceremony was outside, very cute vows, almost too cute. I feel like I would not want super cringy long vows, but it was still enough to make me cry a lot. But then the reception was what really got me. Both dads gave these beautiful speeches. Their first dance was also just so, aw touching that all of the friend group, except for the guys, were like crying, crying. And it makes me think about what I want in my future wedding, in my future partner, and the marriage in general. But the happy couple is now not yet on their honeymoon because she still has a conference to go to and they'll go on the honeymoon after her conference. But just, it's crazy to think about how life can change so fast. Basically, I flew in Saturday morning, commuted like an hour and a half to go to a really nice udon place. I'm not famous, famous, but kind of famous. And then spent like 2 hours getting ready for the wedding. And it was really fun because we got to dress up and we all haven't dressed up in a long, long time and get ready together in a room, catch up, spill some tea. We made our way to the hotel for the wedding. And then for our first experience, a lot of us didn't know what to do. We got there way too early. But it was still a really fun time. And I also just ran into people. I saw random people that I knew and extended my trip because I knew I loved it so much. I didn't want to come back too quickly. Yeah, that was the story of the first wedding I've ever been to.","My soon-to-be sister-in-law's wedding. It was in one of my favorite towns, Gainesville. We each had our own little cottages on the property, so I didn't feel rushed or even worried about getting ready on time since we woke up there.

It was the first wedding I had ever been to as an adult and also felt super close to the people getting married. The morning was great. I stayed with the boys for the most part since I knew them a bit better than the bridesmaids. We were all swapping stories and kidding around while I helped them get ready. My boyfriend looks amazing in his tux, and it actually made me cry because I had never seen him dressed up like that. It honestly made me feel like I couldn't wait to get married for the first time ever in my life.

I sat in the front and helped my boyfriend's grandparents since they are a bit older and have a hard time getting up and down. The bride and groom looked so amazing. They had been together for 8 years, so this was a really big deal to everyone. The ceremony went off without a hitch.

Afterwards, it was just a lot of fun. The meal was buffet style, and I was sitting with my boyfriend, his parents, and his grandparents. I helped his grandparents get food, and again everyone swapped stories. I was so happy to be part of his family and part of this event, and I felt really included.

At the end, we all got Star Wars lightsabers, and we made an archway using them for the bride and groom to walk through. After that, my boyfriend and I spent the rest of the night playing with the little kids who waited the whole day to play with them. We ended up getting beat up like crazy.

I loved the day, and I wouldn't change it for anything.",5,431,364
"Yeah, so the story I\'m going to share today is about my family\'s move. So we used to live in Hino, Texas. And my favorite part about that house, besides my family, of course, was that on the front lawn, the sidewalk, there my sister and I have our handprints there in the cement. So they redid our sidewalk at some point, and then I get it off. But as kids, we were like, ""Ha, ha. Wouldn\'t it be so funny if we left our mark onto cement on the sidewalk here, just to mark our place, that we were here?"" So each of us put our right hand down into the cement when it was so, like, not like wet, but like, not dry either, and left little handprints there. It\'s been like ten years now, and I still think about our handprints there, but eventually my family did move. I was very sad at first because we were taking out all the furniture. We\'re repainting the walls. So when we left, the house just felt so empty, like foreign, like a shell of itself. I didn\'t recognize it after we painted the walls white. Everything was just echoing, and I was like, ""Wow, I grew up here. This is no longer home."" Part of me thought we would always have this home for the rest of my life to come back to. But then we moved to our new house in Allen, Texas. I really quickly adjusted to it. I think because the furniture was the same. Obviously, home is where my parents are. So if they move again, that will be my new home. But now I love our new home a lot. It\'s much bigger. It\'s much more comfortable. But interestingly, I still dream sometimes about my old home. And then there are dreams where I mix my old home and my new home\'s like architectural layout. It\'s really confusing, but the move was fun. We started in COVID summer, so I was home. Luckily, we\'re just moving things back and forth with our cars. The move itself was not too bad. It was definitely a bonding moment within our family to move our stuff ourselves. Yeah. What do you think? So, yeah. We moved. And now that\'s my new home. And I know that my parents will eventually move at least one more time. They will probably downsize their home once the grandkids are older enough that they don\'t need to visit and have their own guest rooms. So I\'m excited for that. Scare. Oh, no. Another home missing. But yes, the story. That was the story of my family moving from one house to another house.","A few months ago, we took a vacation back to my home with my son. It was scary because it was my son's 1st time flying and I was pretty stressed out about it. It was the 1st time I had been back home in years, and the 1st time for most of my family to meet my son, who was one and a half at the time.

The flight went better than expected, and we eventually landed, rented a car, got through customs, and drove to visit family. We spent a lot of time with my mother, who had recently moved into an apartment and was living on her own for the 1st time in her life. My father passed away 3 years ago, and previously she had been living with my younger sister. But she decided everyone needed their own space and moved out.

We got to see all my cousins and aunts and uncles, and my son got to meet his cousins for the 1st time. My husband also got to meet many of my family members he had never met before too.

We had time to see my best friend in the world, who I do not get to see enough. We visited my old childhood home to see how it looked, drove past my high school and grade school, and toured around all the places that had meaning to me growing up.

My mother was so happy to spend time with her grandson. Of course, she spoiled him with toys and presents. To be able to share this with my son and my husband was pretty amazing.

We live so far from where I am from, it was really great to be back with them.",3,546,321
"So today, my story is about the movie I watched yesterday, which was named Joyride. I think it was really interesting because when they first introduced the characters, I was actually a little bit upset because I was like, ""Why are they getting a Korean girl to play a Chinese girl?"" Right? I understand Asian American representation is really important, especially nowadays in media. But later, spoiler alert, there\'s a twist, and it turns out she was supposed to be Korean. So I was like, ""Whoa, it\'s so nice that they actually got ethnicities correct."" So I changed my mind about casting. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the movie. It was about finding out who you are. The storyline basically goes that there\'s this fancy lawyer. She was adopted from China, so she was trying to find her birth mother. They go through a crazy adventure, and eventually they end up in Korea. And she finds out that her birth mother was not only Korean but had also passed away. And it tested their friendship. They did a lot of really crazy things while in East Asia. But overall, I think it was a pretty beautiful message of friendship and how families, family, and your identities, what you make of it, and at the end of the day, just love your people who love you. \n\nSo I really enjoyed the movie. It\'s really, really funny at times. Really emotional sometimes, I definitely cried a little bit at one point when the deceased mother was wishing her daughter well. And it kind of inspired me, too. I think I also want to go on like a soul-searching journey. Yes, that is my story.","I heard this story where this kid who has autism could connect and share his experiences through Elsa. When Elsa closes the door on Anna and how she's feeling in the room, he could then communicate with his mom what he was going through. 

And it was just things like that. We're gonna make sure we make the best movie for this. For the audiences, you really don't know what the people who watch these films are going through. 

I think that was a good motivation to get through all of those times of like, it's really late. I have to come in and do overtime for this. But it's worth it. 

So all those experiences, even though it didn't seem like it was heading in the right direction, it did help me in the end.",1,334,157
"So yesterday, I went into a lab. It was a Saturday. At first, I was a little bit annoyed because I have to work a lot of weekends. And there are times where I really don't want to work on the weekend. But I was also able to schedule a social moment, which helped because after I finished my work, I had a good lunch, took a little break, and then I went to meet up with some people for a birthday party.\n\nAnd at this birthday party, there were a lot of other PhD candidates. And it was interesting because you could see everyone would have these conversations and complain about working on the weekends, about their PIs, about all the stress that comes with being a student. And it made me realize that, yeah, life will probably be very tiring, very rough. But I'm not alone with this. I have a lot of other people going through the same thing, and if anything, they probably work even harder than I do. So it's made me appreciate that I am able to work on the weekends a little bit because it helps me get more data.\n\nBut yeah, again today, I also went into lab and I feel like it's tiring. I don't have any holidays off, so tomorrow is technically a holiday, but I'm still going to go to lab. But I'm not alone. This is a way of life that I think is something I need to wrap my head around, and the more I do it, the more used to it I get. So maybe it's a good thing that I'm slowly getting used to working on the weekends, but I will fix my work-life balance, try to have some fun still, but overall, this is a story of how I'm frustrated but accepting that I have to work on weekends.","I found a new job closer to my house that pays more and has better benefits. It's a larger company, so I won't have to deal with the clique mentality that has taken over my current job. 

I won't have to do the work of 6 people while never being recognized. I won't have to deal with a toxic mentality where my boss pulls me into an office to yell at me for not clicking on one of my screens for an hour when my job requires 14 open. 

I won't have to listen to my boss say I can't step away from my desk when I'm having panic attacks from my PTSD or hear a different manager giggle about comments that my appointments take me out of the office. 

I don't have to deal with so much rudeness and double standards, and having me do the work of a department with no recognition, and people whose slack I've been picking up get promoted.",2,361,182
"So yesterday, I made madeleines for the first time, but interestingly, I don't have any eggs anymore in my fridge. I stopped eating eggs maybe a month ago because I got a blood test and the results came back, and the doctor told me I have high cholesterol, which is really stressful to hear because I'm relatively young. So one thing I did was to cut down on my egg consumption. So all my baking recently has been very experimental, but I made my madeleines without eggs, with half the sugar and half the butter in the recipe. And they turned out okay. Like visually, they looked pretty, but taste-wise, they were just mediocre. But I brought them to lab to celebrate a friend's birthday and everyone seemed to enjoy them. So that made me really happy because I don't have a sweet tooth, but I do enjoy baking things for other people to make them happy. So yeah, that is the story of how I made madeleines last night without any eggs.","I've been dealing with a chronic, ""incurable"" medical condition for around 16 years, but recently, I've discovered something that might be a potential cure. They say food is the best medicine, and I found, perhaps serendipitously, a product at Costco that provided great relief from this medical condition, which can now be classified as a parasitic infection according to my recent blood work results. It happened roughly 2 months ago, but I will describe in detail what the product is and why it helps my condition.

Looking at it from a broader perspective, this event was magnificent and a relief, as it offers tremendous hope for the future, and for others that may have similar woes. While browsing for cheeses in the cheese aisle at Costco, there was a particular brand that stood out to me. It said ""New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese"" on the package label. What is so special about New York extra sharp cheddar cheese, I thought. I've tried so many cheddar cheese brands before, but with little to no benefit.

It turns out that this particular one uses annatto as a food coloring. In general, food coloring is regarded as detrimental to one's health, but annatto is unique. It doubles both as a spice and a food coloring agent. The spice is mild and not usually detectable by our bodies. After eating this cheese, something special happened. The parasites that have been plaguing me for decades started imploding, and there was a mass exodus that I do not wish to describe in detail, but it involved running to the bathroom 30-40 times in the span of 5 hours.

But why? Why did this agent work when so many other expensive medical treatments and anti-parasitic medicines have failed in the past? In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual components of the cheese are important. Annatto is an anti-parasitic agent according to the medical literature. It offers numerous benefits in terms of health and is a relatively common spice used in cooking. Combined with the minuscule amount of milk sugar in the cheese, often referred to as whey, the overall effect is synergistic.",5,198,416
"So, I\'m actually going to be flying home in 3 hours, or leaving for the airport in 3 hours to fly home, and something I\'ve been super excited for—cannot wait. Definitely miss my parents a lot. My younger sister is in New York, so she won\'t be home. But going home will be good for me because I really need the rest. I think something that\'s really hard to do as an adult is to pace yourself, because when you\'re in school, you have semesters. You have projects that you know when they\'ll end. So you have better timelines to fulfill. Like, ""Oh, you know, in two weeks, then you have an exam and then you have a period of free time."" But until then, you\'re working hard. But in grad school, I feel like there\'s just no end. So if you need a break, you have to really go take that break for yourself. For us, you just won\'t have that break. So the last time I was home was probably early June for two days. Home trips are very short. Now I miss having a full week at home, a whole actual vacation. So being able to go home for just like three days this weekend will be very helpful, healing, good for my soul. Yeah, I am most excited to eat my mom\'s food, to go shopping, to feel like a kid again. I feel like life is very tiring and pressurising, so to be able to let loose and let someone take care of me for a little bit will be nice. I did try to take care of my parents as well. I bring them gifts. I listen to them when they\'re lonely, and I hope that their parents can take good care of them when my grandparents are in China, so they\'re not really close by. So it\'s a very different relationship between my mom and her mom, which is my mom and me. But I\'m so grateful for my family, everything about it. So yeah, I left lab a little early today to catch my flight, talking to you now before Doica\'s over or the week begins. And yeah, I\'ll be sad when I come back, but I\'m mostly looking forward to going home first. Yeah.","Today, I spent my afternoon working in the library after classes, and walking back to my dorm, I saw geese munching on the grass and fearlessly crossing the street. I watched the sun set behind the auditorium, heard the cheers of athletes when crossing by the field, saw the sky swathed in pinks and oranges.

For a moment, I just took it all in, closed my eyes, inhaled, exhaled. I haven't felt this recently, but in that moment, I just felt this overwhelming sense of peace.

This place is rough, don't get me wrong - I'm getting absolutely rolled academically, and I don't get enough sleep - but walking back to my dorm today, I felt like I was coming home. It was a feeling of contentment, like no matter what, everything was going to be okay.

Anyways, I hope everyone has a good day.",5,457,173
"Tuesday, yeah. So this Tuesday, I played squash for the very first time, and today\'s Friday, so it\'s been three days and I\'m still very sore from it. But it was my first time really trying something new in a while. I played with a couple of upperclassmen, and as a perfectionist, it\'s really hard for me to show my failure weakness. But what was really nice about the whole situation was that everyone was super friendly, even though I kept missing the ball. And it really made me feel a lot better about myself. I can\'t explain how silly it sounds, but for my upperclassmen friends to be so supportive of me, messing up, failing, and being nice playing the ball was really nice. When the guys played against each other, they were like, ""swing real hard, the ball is going so fast, so hard."" But when they played against me and another girl, they were a lot easier on us, which is kind of gentlemanly of them, I think. Yeah. The point was that I was able to fail a lot and be really bad at a sport and not feel really ashamed of it. So it was a really good first experience, and I definitely will play again sometime (unsure when) because I\'m still so sore, and it did take a very long time to get there. But overall, I really enjoyed the experience. So that was the story of me playing squash for the first time and not being afraid of not being perfect.","No one thinks about bobsledding as a kid, especially around here, sunny southern California. You see it on TV during the Olympics, and that's it. It's just not something that you think about doing at a young age.

When I came to UCLA, even by my fourth, fifth year, I was like, what am I gonna do? Track's almost over, I keep getting hurt throwing javelin, and it's just like, what's next? That's when my coach encouraged me to try out for bobsledding. Never been in a sled before, never been on ice before, but you have to realize, what can I do now that I'll not be able to do later on?

You can't go back and bobsled in ten years, you have to do it now. This is the only time you can do it. So I was like, I gotta go do this, I gotta try it now or else I'll never know. And that ultimately led to Korea for the Winter Olympic Games.

So, for me, my goal has always been the same, to make the Olympics. I just didn't realize it would be in bobsledding, but here I am.",3,302,240
"All right, this is something that happened to me when I was around ten years old. I have a little sister, and it was her first day of kindergarten. We went to elementary school right across the street from our house, so it was my job to walk her to school and then wait for her and walk her back home, even though we\'re just not even a block away.\n\nSo, the first day of school, she went to kindergarten, and I went to fifth grade. And when the day was over, I totally forgot about her. So, I came home alone, and my mother saw me and asked, ""Where\'s Lori?"" I was filled with absolute horror, tore back across the street, and found my sister standing on the steps of the school, just really upset.\n\nShe could have walked home herself, of course, but she was supposed to wait for me. And she was actually surrounded by teachers who were trying to console her that her big sister forgot about her. I was filled with simultaneous guilt, relief, and horror. And I have never forgotten that moment.","This week, my son started first grade. He is the youngest of all my children and the only boy. He was in kindergarten last year, and that was hard for me as well, as I had to come to terms with the fact that he was growing up and wasn't my little baby anymore. However, it was only kindergarten, so he still felt like a ""baby"" to me. 

This year, however, he is noticeably older and more grown up. As he walked down the street towards the bus on his first day of first grade, he looked like a ""big kid"" instead of my little baby. It made me both happy and sad, as he is becoming such a wonderful young man, yet at the same time, my little baby no longer is little (This is also evident as his clothes from last year are too small. Last year they were too big). 

Most surprisingly, he wasn't scared or nervous this year. At the start of kindergarten last year, he cried and begged me to stay home. I really wanted to keep him home as well! This year, he didn't cry for me or try to run back home for another hug. I was glad he was feeling more independent, but part of me wished he needed me more. 

My little man is growing up so fast. I wish I could turn back the time and keep him my baby forever. Although I cannot, he will still always be ""mama's baby.""",3,217,296
"Winter. I don't like winter. I don't like dealing with snow. I don't like dismal weather. I just don't like it. It must be Seasonal Affective Disorder. Really hate it. I wouldn't want to live someplace with no climate. But I do dread the winter months. So, several years ago, I bought some Crocus bulbs. I'm not much of a gardener, but I thought I would give it a try. So, with a lot of work, I dug a path along my sidewalk and planted these Crocus bulbs. Two different kinds, smaller ones and larger ones. In October, it was a very dismal day out - rainy, cloudy, cold wind. I was miserable doing it. And then, I kind of forgot about the Crocus bulbs. But the following March, I happened to look outside and I saw some of the green shoots coming up out of the ground. And this made me so happy. It made me feel so much better about things in general. And I just had this profound sense that, yes, things will keep on going the way that they should be going. That everything will be all right in the world. And it made me very happy. So now, several years later, I look forward to seeing my Crocuses come up in the spring.","I came from a tropical country where it's always summer. Then I moved and lived in Japan. I can't begin to describe how much I love having the other 3 seasons to enjoy! And my favorite has got to be fall.

I came to Japan late summer, and it was fall that was the first ""new"" season that I got to know. It was magical how the days became so cool, like there was AC turned on everywhere. I can wear thicker clothes and enjoy hot dishes without sweating so much. It was just so comfy; I was so happy I can experience it.

But since we didn't have this season back home, I didn't know how to spend it. I had to watch Youtube videos, and it's mostly western people with pumpkins and pumpkins, and lots of sweets and spices. Right now, I bought tiny pumpkins to decorate various corners of the house. I plan to get some dried bouquet flowers too, and a lot of candles.

I don't bake, so I got bottles of aromatic oils that smells like pumpkin pie, caramel cookies, coffee cakes, cinnamon rolls, vanilla frosting, etc. Oh, plus movies and books! I'm going through a lot of fun adventure stories. I plan to marathon the Harry Potter movies.",5,262,254
"But one of the props mentioned a song that was meaningful for you, and I have one, nothing special, because I\'m sure that millions and millions and millions of people share this same exact experience. But when I was around 40 years old, the song ""Landslide"" by Fleetwood Mac really spoke to me. I started to listen to the lyrics, and the part that goes, ""Time makes this boulder, even children get older, and I\'m getting older, too."" It hit me like a rock to the head, and I realized, well, yeah, this is pretty much it. It\'s going to be downhill from here. But fortunately, now that I\'m almost 69 years old, I am reconciled to getting older, and I know that there are still many wonderful things in store for me.","My music taste has definitely changed as I grew up, but there are a few songs that always invoke feelings of nostalgia when time was much more peaceful and enjoyable. One of these songs is called ""Bubbly"" by Colbie Caillat, and I heard it playing today at Trader Joe's while I was buying some groceries. It was such a weird and nostalgic experience, and I stuck around even after I paid to listen to the full thing play out. 

I remember being in kindergarten where we had a designated ""nap time,"" and the teacher would always play this song softly in the background. I remember being picked up by mom and going to get a snack after school with this song playing on the radio. 

It was so weird realizing that all of this happened and is a part of me, and I know that sounds really dumb, but it's just grounding to notice how far you've come with everything. I'm now in college away from that easy-going life of a little kindergartener, where all I had to worry about was what outdoor game me and my friends would play or what fun things I would do with my family over the weekend. 

It's just crazy to me how times change, but at the end of it all, I'm still me. It's even more crazy to me how just a simple 3-minute song made me have so many thoughts at the same time.",5,163,272
"In 2006, my sister and I were teaching a class and there was an art therapy student named Kevin. He was a very exceptional person, exceptional artist, and he had a very interesting story. He was involved in a terrible car accident and was in a coma for a month. When he came out of the coma, he realized that he could not draw or paint with his right hand anymore, so he taught himself how to use his left hand to create art.\n\nKevin was one of our best students and his story was the subject of the first book that we did for our small press. He wrote his story and did a wonderful job. We published his book. At that time, there was a contest. Carnegie Hall was looking for cover art for their program for the concert season. And without telling Kevin, we entered one of his paintings in the contest, and he actually won. It was a wonderful moment. We are very proud of him.\n\nPart of the prize was tickets to Carnegie Hall for a concert, and Kevin gave us the tickets. So we went to New York and went to the concert and we had a great time. So he was our first and to this day our best author.","I went to medical school in India, and I came here and I did my Master's in Hospital Administration. And when I was rotating as a part of my internship, that's when I realized that something is stopping me from being myself.

I really wanted to be with people, I wanted to be a social being. And I wanted to see more smiles, make a difference in someone's life, and touch someone's life on an everyday basis.

And when I did my externship in different places, I really enjoyed pediatrics. I was fortunate to work with autistic kids and kids who have seizures and other medical problems. And it was really touching for me to see how much the parents go through to have one autistic child, how much they see, and the patience that they have.

At the end of the day, what pays off is your satisfaction. If you're happy in what you're doing, no matter how many sacrifices it takes, no matter how much effort it takes. If you're happy, if you're satisfied, if you just know this is where my heart is, follow your heart. That's it. You will keep doing. No matter how many challenges or sacrifices, you will stay strong.",5,237,243
"One of the prompts was to talk about a movie that meant something to you. When I was in high school, in the late 60s, this is when all the counterculture types were really into Tolkien. And that was the first time that he became a phenomenon in this country. So, I was into it and just devoured the book. Made a big impression on me. I never dreamed that it would be possible to translate these books into film. But when the Peter Jackson movies came out, the special effects were more advanced. I think that Peter Jackson did a magnificent job with a story just true to Tolkien\'s vision. The actors were all just top notch. But I think that the single most memorable scene for me, wasn\'t necessarily one of the big battle set pieces, but it was right at the beginning of the first movie. When Gandalf weiss\'s cart into town and sees Frodo waiting alongside the road. And Gandalf asks Frodo, ""Get in the cart. We\'ll go into town together."" And he does. And then Ian McKellen as Gandalf looks at Frodo and smiles at him with such unbelievable love. It just blows off the screen and you could just see that Tolkien would have adored this portrayal of Gandalf. And it\'s interesting that Ian McKellen just doesn\'t take acting all that seriously and has been on a variety shows where he says, ""Well, somebody else writes the lines. I just stand where I\'m supposed to stand and read."" But he is a summit actor. And what he did with no words at all, just facial expressions just brought a whole Lord of the Rings feel of it in such an immediate, immediate way. I never forgot that.","I directed a play that worked very well in Boston, and one day a producer came to me and said, ""Your play is so vicious, so wonderful. We're gonna do a special with your play.'' So I agreed.

And they shoot a film, Sixteen, and I was with a crew, and I was fascinated. I trained to direct actors, but I never worked in television or any movie before.

You have to be honest about yourself, be honest with others, and be honest about what you want. If you have this spirit of doing what you want to do -- because I think that is the right thing -- you have to do it.",3,334,134
"In high school, I wasn't one of the popular kids. Most people thought that I was kind of an eccentric weirdo. I'm not saying that they're wrong. I never quite fit in, but I did have a couple of friends who were outcasts just like I was. When I was a senior, my father bought me a used car. It was a green Duster. And I happened to be the first one in the class to have a car. So I drove that car to school. And when it was time for lunch, I would take my friends and drive around to get some food. We would park by the river and have a good time, and pretty much show off. And that was one of my happiest memories of high school. And I can still remember how proud I felt of that little Duster.","When I was a little kid, I wanted to be an astronaut, I wanted to be a scientist. When I got out of high school, my parents wanted me to go work at the pen factory in town assembling pens. My mom took me to all the little factories in the county to turn in applications because that's what I was supposed to do.

My mom did graduate from high school and then got married. And they sort of expected me to do the same thing. Go work in a factory, go get married, have kids.

There's still a little bit of a rift in the family because I went off and did my own thing. So it doesn't always turn out perfect, but I can live with it. I love my family, they love me, they're just not happy that I live 2,000 miles away. And they just really don't tell their friends I build video games.",2,165,181
"Okay. So, last year, I moved from Nashville to Boston, and made a big change in my life. And it was really challenging because I had a lot of friends in Nashville, a great community. I like to salsa dance and all of my friends came together before I left, and I threw a party. And they all came up with a really big gift basket for me. It had some of my favorite foods, things to bring with me to Boston. And one of the things that really was special, that they gave me, that made me really just warmed my heart. It made me feel so much gratitude and love, was they got me a gift certificate to have a dance lesson with an instructor here in Boston that has an amazing reputation that we've all wanted to train with. And now that I'm in Boston, I was able to take a class with her, and they gifted that to me. So it was a really huge gesture, and it makes me miss my friends so much. So much so, I'm going to visit them in a week, and hopefully dance and hang out with them again.","I was tired of living in Southern Illinois. Tired of the cornfields and the same people every day. It was time for a change - a drastic change. The move of a lifetime.

I packed my things, took my 2 dogs, and booked it to Florida. The Sunshine State. What a huge difference it was! I knew no one, not a single soul. I had never been there before. Talk about adapting!

I got settled in my little 1-bedroom apartment downtown and took myself for a celebratory drink. I met some people at the bar who I ended up becoming very close with after a few months.

Although it got extremely lonely at times, I think I needed this move to help me grow into the woman I am today. It has taught me strength, independence, resilience, and so many other things. I am very thankful for the opportunity to experience something so life-changing and freeing.

If I could do it all over again, I definitely would. Next stop... California!",4,227,196
"Cool, yeah. So, I just got a new job and it's not close enough to where I can walk or take public transportation. So, I needed to buy a car. It was very nerve-wracking because I need a car soon, and I kind of had to make a decision pretty quickly. And the original car that I wanted to buy was not available, so that was disappointing. But they pointed me to a car that is used, but only has 116 miles on it. So, it's basically brand new, but it's used so it's not the original sticker price. I've never purchased a car that new, and I've never been able to afford a car that new. So, it's kind of scary and exciting at the same time. So, I get to have this new car. I've never had anything this fancy, but it's also a very large purchase and it's probably the largest purchase I've ever made in my life. And I know that my parents have never purchased a new car. I mean, none of my family has purchased a new car. They've never been able to afford it. So, to be in this position, it feels very strange but good but scary.","I have been unemployed for approximately 6 months. I sprained my ankle at work and I have been laid off from the job. In the spring, April 2019, my unemployment compensation will run out. I have been applying for jobs and interviewing but could not find anything. I was really getting discouraged. I have health issues, and some jobs I just can't do anymore. I am unable to stand on my feet for long periods of time. That cut out a lot of jobs.

One evening, my son called me and told me he had seen a job in the newspaper and thought I should call. It was an office manager job at the sewer plant in the small town my parents live in. I knew the people who worked there and the person doing the hiring. I called him immediately, and he wanted me to send him my information. He said he thought I would be perfect for the job.

I met with him the next week and was offered the job. I was so happy. The job is only part-time, but that works great for me. I am able to work in the mornings and go to doctor or physical therapy appointments in the afternoons.

I am so excited to start this job. I will be the office manager. I know I will have a lot to learn, but I am so looking forward to it. I hope this is the start of a better future for me. I will be doing the work I like, and I will be able to do it without putting more strain on my body.",5,247,304
"Do. So, about I don\'t know, in 2013, I ran a five-mile race to raise money for cancer research. And afterwards, I went to a local place to eat that I hadn\'t been to before, and I decided to order the soup called Senkoco, and I didn\'t know what it was. But it sounded good, and it had chicken in it, so I ordered it. And when I got it and I took the first spoonful, I was immediately transported to my childhood. I realized that Sankulta was the name of the soup that my grandmother used to make for me growing up. And when she would cook, I would get so hungry. I could just smell the soup—it smells so good, so savory. And I would go to my grandmother, and I would beg her, ""Grandma, grandma is the soup ready?"" It was never ready, like it was, it always took a long time. And so at some point, she would say, ""Okay,"" and she would take a coffee mug and she would scoop up some of the broth, and she would let me sip on the broth and... it\'s probably one of my favorite things to eat. I still don\'t know how to cook it myself, but Senkoco is something that just brings me back to being with her and her love and caring. So that\'s my story.","I'd been a real estate agent, I owned an art gallery. I thought my main goal was to really be a good wife, a good mother, and then my life changed completely. My second son was born with a lung disease. They didn't think he'd make it, he got jaundice, and when I brought him home, he'd lost the ability to wake to feed. And so I thought, watching him struggle to breathe, I'd never take breathing for granted again.

And I think that's sort of the beginning of me becoming an environmentalist. And so many times, I feel like I'm paying back the debt because why should I be so lucky? What can I do to survive this life and be a success, so when the end of my road comes, I can look back and say, ""I really feel good about it""?

And it may not be something globally. I think that if you touch anyone's life, then you're a success.",1,271,197
"Week. So, I performed this weekend at the salsa Congress, and it reminded me of when I performed as a child. I took tap lessons for eight years, and there was one particular incident that was really scary and embarrassing. I was performing with two other girls. I was in the center, and I had one to my left and one to my right. Ashley was to my right, and Michelle was to my left. And part of our routine was to tap dance while jump roping. And we were wearing these leotard costumes with fringe skirts. And as we were performing, jump roping and tap dancing at the same time, Michelle's jump rope got caught in the back of the fringe of her costume, and I was in a high school auditorium, packed, completely packed house. And she ran off stage, and the crowd started to laugh. And Ashley and I kept dancing like we didn't stop. And while we were dancing, I looked over to my left off stage, and I could see one of the stage moms ripping out the fringe from the jump rope from Michelle's costume. And I could see that she was trying to push Michelle back onto stage, and Michelle was resisting all the while still doing my routine. The crowd's like giggling. And then the woman, the stage mom, successfully, literally shoved Michelle back onto the stage, and we had to finish the routine, and she rallied and caught back up. But it was kind of scary and I hadn't performed again in front of a crowd that large until this weekend, which was scary, but also exciting. So I feel like I kind of went through one of the worst experiences already, so I knew that this could only be better. And I was also supported by another 20 team members, so that made it really fun and helped kind of make me feel a little more protected. The safety in numbers type of thing. So, that's my story.","I'm 23 and just kind of finding my own path. I wrestled when I was 11 years old. It was because my dad got me into it. I went out and got my butt kicked by every other middle school kid I went up against, 35 times in a row.

Before I was really capable of making decisions for myself, my parents had rooted in me that I needed to find a way to persevere in the things that mattered the most. Whether it was figuring out how to feed myself or clothe myself, just day to day activities.

Athletically, they wouldn't let me quit in the middle of the season. It went a long way. They taught me not to give up so easily.

My biggest complaint with the American system and graduating high school, going to college, and getting a job is that the common progression is to prepare you to be an employee. But you don't have to. There are ways and avenues to be able to go around and make something happen and build a business around something that you love.",2,388,206
"So, I think I've mentioned that I have a cat. His name is Zoro. I adopted him when my other cat was about ten years old. Sadly, my other cat passed away a couple of years ago. I had him for 15 years and he was just super, like the best cat ever. And we were super close, definitely bonded. But when I adopted Zoro, he was only five months old and a couple of weeks in, my ex-husband, he got home before I did from grad school and his brother had come over and he was careless, and Zoro slipped out of the front door. He must have been extremely careless because the doorway is very narrow, so you really have to not be paying attention to have something like Zoro just slip by you. And I came home and I was terrified. He was only five months old. I was living in Florida and my apartment was adjacent to a nature conservation area. And in Florida, there are a lot of dangerous animals that would be predators to Zoro. Gators, alligators, venomous snakes, even hawks. He was small enough for him to be prey for a hawk, and that was all just feet away from my door. So I was really scared and I looked on the Internet. I looked at all the advice that people gave. I was searching everywhere. I stayed up all night. He didn't come to the door. And the next day, I finally got enough courage and was exhausted. I put on my rain boots, I tucked in my pants and put on a sweatshirt and a bandana over my face, and I went into the nature conservation area to find Zoro. It had been about 18 hours since he had disappeared and I happened to get close enough to the bush that he was hiding under for him to feel safe enough to meow. And I found him. But it was terrifying. And I did run into a gator at one point. Thankfully, I backed away slowly and the gator didn't present any aggressive behavior towards me, but it was scary. I was really worried. But I found him and Zoro is with me today, so I'm very glad that it worked out.","I was coming out of the grocery store and saw something black wiggling in the bushes on the edge of the curb in the parking lot. I thought it was a duck at first, so I didn't pay much attention, except that maybe I would move it after unloading my groceries so that it didn't get run over by someone else parking at the store. 

I put all my stuff in the back of my trunk and got in my car. All of a sudden, I remembered about the baby duck, turned the car off, and got out to go move it to a spot farther away in the parking lot, closer to the canal on the west side of the grocery store. 

I was shocked to see it was not a duck, but rather, a baby kitten covered in ants! I grabbed a Gatorade bottle that I had just bought, and in a panic dumped it on top of the kitten to wash off some of the ants. The kitten didn't have his eyes open and was crying loudly at this point. 

A person in the parking lot saw what was going on and ran over with some paper towels that were in her car. Neither of us could find a mom cat or any other kittens. I held the baby close and kept picking off ants. They weren't biting me, so at least I knew they weren't fire ants, but there were thousands of them crawling over my arms and stomach, as well as on the baby kitten. 

I decided the only thing I could do was wrap the kitten in an extra shirt in my car, put it on my lap, and bring it home. I have bottle-feeding experience and knew I needed to feed him right away. Shelters will euthanize a kitten that cannot feed itself. Asking for help from a rescue group in my area is pointless. I knew no one else would help this kitten, so I did the right thing and brought him to my house. 

I was afraid to bathe him at such a young age, but I had to get the rest of the ants and Gatorade off of him if he was going to have a chance at survival. I stayed up all night feeding him goat's milk from a syringe every two hours. I kept him warm by placing a sock filled with uncooked rice that I heated in the microwave every 30 minutes or so. 

It was a long night, but he survived! I was so happy!",5,433,474
"There was one time when he goes, I can't remember which one of my birthdays it was, but my mom had set it up to be at a Nathan's Hot Dog, and they had like an arcade. And everyone got tokens. And they were able to play all these games to win tickets that they could then pick prizes from. And two girls that lived down the street for me, they were sisters. They lived in a basement apartment. They had a single mom, no dad. And they couldn't afford to get me a present for my birthday. But they still came to the party. Totally fine. My mom didn't care. And they both played the arcade games to win as many tickets as possible, so that they could take the tickets and use them for a prize to give me as a gift for my birthday. And that was just something really, their selflessness to want to get me a gift on my birthday when they could have easily just taken those tickets and used them for themselves was really touching.","Initially, I did not want to be a teacher. But as I went through school, I realized by the time I was in high school that I needed to be a teacher. The reason that I needed to be a teacher was because I loved school a lot. I loved learning a lot. But I didn't have a teacher that I really liked. 

I felt, at a young age, that if I had had that kind of experience where I felt connected to my school and connected to at least one teacher, I would've been an even better student and school would've been a better experience for me. 

I felt that when it was time for me to become a teacher, my job was not to be your friend but for you to know as strict as I was, that I still cared about you, and I cared about your achievement, and I cared about you as a human being. 

I've gotten to a place in my life where what is most important to me is to make a difference, no matter how small or how big, it's to make a difference. 

Whatever you decide to do with do in your lives, it has to be something that becomes your life work. It has to be your life work. Because this world now is at a place where you can make money, you certainly can make money. And you can make a lot of money. But your life's work, a piece of it has to be able to help other people.",3,205,294
"Cool. I don't have a story about work, but I do have a story about the trip I took last week. I took a very short trip to Nashville to see my sister and to meet my new nephew. He's six months old. And when I lost my job in January, he was born at the end of February and I wasn't able to see him for this whole time he's been alive. And it's been really hard. I wanted to see him right away and to hold him. And without a job, I really couldn't plan a trip to go see him. So as soon as I was hired, I immediately bought a plane ticket so I could go see him. And it was so satisfying to hold him for the first time. And I facetimed with him and read him books. When she was still pregnant, I would read over the phone to him. And we basically, as soon as I saw him, it's like we were old friends. And I just got to hold him and play with him. And it was the best feeling.","I found out that my wife is pregnant with our first child! When I first found out, I was overcome with emotions. At first, I was so happy and excited because we had been trying for so long to get pregnant. Then I was overcome with sadness. You see, my dad passed away a couple years ago. In my eulogy, I spoke how the day that I find out I would be a father would be one of the toughest days for me. That would be because I wouldn't be able to call him and see his excitement. I wouldn't be able to call him for advice.

My wife is now about 6 months pregnant. Still, to this day, I have highs and lows because of these two things. Highs because I am so excited to be a dad. Lows because I don't have my dad here to help me.

We found out we are having a girl! I always thought I wanted a boy first, but when I found out we were having a girl, I was so ecstatic. I immediately went into papa bear mode. I began looking into how to be the best dad to a girl. What I needed to know about having a girl. I know that she is going to be the most important thing in my life.

So this sums up not only my most recent important life experience but probably the most important one ever!",4,217,273
"A very good week at work. I did get some really kind of sad news. My uncle has lung cancer and he's in the hospital. He's been fighting it for a long time now, and he's just, like, not doing well. I'm not exactly sure what his status is. And my other uncle passed away of lung cancer, and his wife, my aunt, also passed away due to complications from smoking. And I'm really kind of scared.","About 4 months ago, I had a horrific thing happen in my life. My life will be forever changed. My dad had been sick with what everyone thought was the flu. He was throwing up and complaining of being very tired and hot. He didn't even have a fever. He had been sick for a few days, but on a Tuesday in the early evening, everything quickly spiraled out of control. 

My mom called my husband and asked him to hurry over to the house because she thought something was wrong with my dad. He went over there, and my dad was not doing well at all. He didn't know his name, where he was at, and who my mom or my husband were. My mom immediately called 9-1-1. 

When the ambulance got there, they immediately checked my dad's vitals and got him loaded to rush to the hospital. They took him to the intensive care unit and got him hooked up to a million different machines to see if they could figure out what was going on with him. By this time, it was late into the night on Tuesday. We were all sitting in the waiting room until more information was known. It was a very long night of millions of tests and no answers. 

Finally, early in the morning on Wednesday, a doctor came out and told my mom that my dad was suffering from kidney failure. We were all in shock because he hadn't been sick long at all. We asked what we could do, and the doctor said it was too late to do anything and that if they even tried to operate, he would die. The doctor could not give us a timeline of how long he would live, but that it wouldn't be more than six weeks. 

Well, it turns out it would be even sooner than that. By early the next morning, my dad had passed away. We were all in shock because there hadn't been any warning signs, and just a week ago, he had been happy and hanging out with us. We were devastated, and from that moment on, our lives had changed forever.",4,95,412
"Yeah. So this is the beginning of the school year, and I've seen a lot of people moving into their dorms and apartments. And it really got me thinking about when I first went to College, when I was moving into the dorm. How excited my parents were for me and scared. And I was both excited and scared, moving away from home and my parents, and knowing that I'd probably get really homesick. Watching all those kids moving in really made me think about how that felt for me. And it was really important for me, there was a lot of pressure for me to do well in College because my dad came here from a developing country and wasn't able to get an education past second grade. And I was the first person in my family to go to College, and to make it that far. So I had a lot of emotions, definitely some anxiety, some stress about the pressure of performing and doing well. But also the excitement, and kind of the normal fear that you get doing something you've never done before and not having parents who had never experienced College like that before. I didn't really have anyone to go to, to understand what that meant, like what to expect. So watching those kids just brought me back to that moment.","""You are so smart."" That phrase has been told to me since I was a kid. I felt special when I was told this, so I did everything I could to get that phrase told to me by my peers, parents, and teachers. I even got into college with a pretty big scholarship.

But now that I am in my second year of college, I am massively struggling as I now see that my crutches, in the form of extra credit, scheduling that was given to me, and caring teachers, are gone. I stay up late doing homework, studying, trying to remember the information that I understand but can't retain, but it's not enough to pass tests that were supposed to be easy.

I feel like I was never that smart, just lucky. The little voice in the back of my head is telling me that everything that I have built up over the years should just be burned down, that I don't deserve to be in college. I should just let myself flunk out and let my family, friends, and everyone see me as what I am—an idiot who got a bit of luck and doesn't deserve the praise she got over the years.",3,255,235
"So, I recently finished at work for a local museum. It's using techniques and technology that I haven't used before, which is exciting for me. So, it was a bit of a challenge to get it done in the month's time that I had to finish it. And, a few days ago, it was really nice to hear feedback about the work. Lots of people interacted with it, and friends came and saw it. All very good. It's a few days later now, and I have this lingering feeling of a bit of a letdown emotionally. Afterwards, it just feels like a lot of effort and, exactly, but there's a bit of an anticlimactic post-called postpartum kind of feeling after creating a network.","I started off in physics, electrical engineering. I got my masters in biomedical engineering. Then I started a construction company. And that was just a result of buying a house I could afford in my 20s, which was really broken down and needed a lot of work. And so I worked on it, and I loved that. I found I had a real passion for construction. So then I was trying to reconcile construction, biomedical engineering, not quite sure how that works together.

All of that stopped completely when I had gotten married, and I had a baby three months early with cerebral palsy. He's now 11, so I realized as I was going to physical therapy with my son. I was getting so frustrated looking for things that were really gonna help my son. So we pulled together a team and created a device that I thought was going to help my son. It's a little wearable sensor. 

And my company Dynofit, that's what we have now. It's amazing, life is long. And you really have the opportunity to do a lot of different things. I don't really define myself as I'm a this or I'm a that. I'm a lot of things, we all are.",3,146,243

"Wow, it was a beautiful evening and there were thousands of small swallows flying in the sky overhead. The sky was turning red and purple because it was sunset. It was absolutely beautiful, very peaceful.","I was on a vacation with my brother, and we decided to take a long road trip through New England and up to the Canadian border. We set off with only a rough destination in mind and intending to go or do whatever caught our eye over the long drive of about a week. We stopped in many cool little towns along the way. There were really great old antique shops all over, and I loved looking through the old memorabilia.

Along the route, we were passing through Vermont, and off the side of the road, we saw a beautiful grassy mountain with a waterfall cascading down the side. We thought it looked so cool, we parked and decided to hike up the mountainside a bit. It was an easy climb but long and tiring. We stayed as close to the waterfall as we could as we went up.

We ended up climbing all the way to the top and got an amazing view. On the way back down, we took a different route and not far from the top, found a glistening pool where the waterfall cascaded, and then continued out the other side. It was perfect for taking a refreshing dip, and we did! It was ice cold but really awesome.

The rest of the trip was great. We went into little towns and ate amazing seafood. I never ate so much lobster and so many bowls of chowder in my life! It was really amazing, and there were many memorable spots. We even crossed the border into Canada and drove a ways up the coast, which was really rugged and beautiful. We visited a national park in Canada and spent one night there.

We saw many beautiful spots, but that one dip on the mountainside in the ice-cold spring water was the coolest part and a great memory.",3,40,343
"This story may be repetitive, but we had a little issue with the setup of the computer. Here, it didn't take the whole story, so I'll start again. So, I wanted to talk about my little city garden. I have been replacing a lot of plants that were in my garden with native pollinator-friendly plants. It has been a lot of work, but I believe it's paying off. I have been having butterflies in the garden - Monarch butterflies and Swallowtail butterflies. It has been a joy to see that the work has paid off because in the city, we need more green, we need more butterflies.","Last week, I received my completed patent. I have been working on a novel method for reclaiming wastewaters. There have been many struggles along the way, anything from machine failures to group infighting, which led to project disbandment. It was surprising that after all this time, the technology would end up belonging to me. This makes me happy and proud as an inventor and developer.

The technology has been used successfully in mining applications. It cleans AMD to potable levels. It uses no chemicals and is low power. The system can be used at any altitude. Power requirements are now low enough for off-grid power.

As the inventor and lead developer, I am more than proud of this accomplishment. It took so long to complete. I felt like giving up many times along the way. So glad I didn't.",3,124,159
"Here's my story today. And maybe it's more a reflection than a story, but just wanted to talk to you about my son's 40th birthday. It crept up on me, and that was interesting. He lives in another state. Now he's married. He has a child, and we do not have a day-to-day communication relationship. So he's very busy. So we catch each other when we can. Birthdays always make me reminisce about them growing up, both my sons. But this one was my younger son. So different. You think about a day that we were born, when you drop them off at kindergarten, their first day, first grade, and on to dropping them off at college and all that, and then their wedding. It's a lot of emotions during the day when they have their birthday, it always seems to happen to me. But now he's 40, and he has his own life, his own family. And our conversations are so different now. It's no longer the parent-child conversation. It's two adults talking. He told me all about how his house is coming along. He's doing a lot of renovations. He has a new job and wanted to talk about his daughter, who was starting second grade next week. So it was all very pleasant. But it's so different. It's just how life evolves over the years, from parent child to a different kind of relationship. And it is a little bit like the tables are turning. So a lot of memories in this city, a lot of memories. But that was today. And it always happens during their birthdays. So that's my story today.","My daughter and I took a trip to California. She read online about the train going down to California. It was highly romanticized, but it did look nice. We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery. It surprised me that the food was so good. 

However, one of the really surprising things was the people we met. When they seat you at dinner, they put you with strangers, so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story. The stories were so interesting, and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them. In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once. It was really amazing. One person was nearly 94, but he appeared to be in his seventies. One couple was from the Philippines. One man was laid off and took a low-end job, and he admitted that his parents were supporting him. 

There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and I kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story. Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story. We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures, and it became very raw and personal. 

Previously, my daughter and I had not been very close. This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close. But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me. What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband. It was so surprising because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy. 

Yet through the stories of strangers, I feel closer and more focused than ever. When she was little, we were so close. However, as she became a teenager, we have a more strained relationship. But after this trip, we are as close as ever.",3,332,397
"Hello. Hi, I belong to an organization of elderly retired people who take care of each other. When somebody is not feeling well, we can run errands, walk the dog, that kind of thing. But we're also branching out to a more social adventure so we can bring people outside and be social because it's a real problem among the elderly that they are too isolated.\n\nSo in the beginning of the summer, I started a bocce group. I think it originated in Italy, with throwing balls down the lane. People get competitive. It's interesting. It has not been easy to get people to join. People tend to be busy, I think. They're a little worried about going outside and doing a game with other people, but I think it's worth keep on pushing it.\n\nLast night we had a very nice group together. We actually had two teams and we played for about an hour. It was really nice. We laughed a lot. People got a little competitive, etcetera, and it was fun. Now my goal is to get more people to join because I think it's good for people to be outside, do a game, and have fun. So that is my goal for the next couple of weeks. I hope we can keep playing into the fall and that we get more people to join. We'll see what happens and we'll all have to come up with something different when the weather gets colder. But that's my story today.","I was grocery shopping a few weeks ago. I had purchased my items and was leaving the store. I noticed an older woman with a cart of groceries. She was walking home and was trying to figure out a way to carry all of her bags. I live across the street from the grocery store, so I told myself I should offer some assistance to her.

I approached her and offered my help. I told her I would drop my things off at home and come back to help her carry some things. She lived nearby as well. So I did exactly that. I dropped my things off at home and came back to the store to help her carry her bags to her home.

She was very appreciative of my help. She wanted to give me a cake she had made, and I declined. Instead, we talked for a few minutes, exchanged names and phone numbers, and laughed about the oddities of life. We had a good time together.

I learned that she lived alone at home, so grocery shopping or shopping of any kind is a challenge. I told her we could go for coffee sometime as a thank you. I felt good about helping her. I think it's important to help others when we are able, and I was able to help her.

I wanted to help her. She's a lovely woman, and now we are friends. She knows she can count on me to help if she needs it. I visit with her once a week. We have coffee at her home, out on her patio, or in a coffee shop and just talk.

I have helped her plant flowers and other items. She started a garden this summer, and I help her with that as well.",4,290,339
"Okay. I went to the movies yesterday, and it was sort of interesting. It was a movie called ""Jewels."" And it\'s about an elderly man who has started to get memory issues. But one night he was asleep, and a small spaceship landed in his backyard. Sounds silly, but it was a real sweet story. It ruined his garden, and an ex-movie found a little alien on his doorstep. Like an alien with big eyes, but it wouldn\'t talk. And he had to figure out what he could feed it. But he took it inside and then he called the authorities about what had happened, and nobody wanted to believe him. He talked to some friends; they didn\'t believe him. His daughter thought he was crazy, and she took him to a neurologist to get his memory checked. But two friends happened to come by to check on him and went into the alien. So the three of them started taking care of a little creature, and it was quite an interesting story. Quite sweet. But it sort of resonated with me because a couple of days ago, I was somewhere with some friends, and we did something; I can\'t even remember what. And I mentioned, thinking out loud, ""Oh, this is a good story for my robot."" And it looked at me sort of strange. And I said, ""Yeah, I\'m working with this robot study for the Media Lab at MIT."" And they just looked very puzzled, and they just changed the subject. It was really interesting selling this whole alien thing and really happened. I could relate to that. See what other notes that I have on it, but I just keep thinking that even things like a gbo robot could be just like the little alien, meaning something to elderly people that are alone and don\'t see a lot of people during the day. And it could create some kind of friendship. There\'s three older people really open up to each other and talked about their past. And they were telling everything to the alien, who basically just stared at them and he wouldn\'t talk, but it was the cutest story when the alien got their little spaceship working again and he wanted them to come with him to outer space. In the end, it didn\'t work, but it was cute. But it seems just like, how can people relate to other creatures that are not really people and yet it\'s sort of a beneficial social companionship. So those are my thoughts. And I think that\'s it for today.","Being six years old, we postcards coming into my family, as one after another of the relatives that my parents had, were dead in the concentration camps. And I remember just being very affected by that as a six or seven-year-old. 

I became convinced right then that I did not want to be one of those people. I wanted to be a kind of person that helped other people. That instead of bringing suffering, I wanted to try to alleviate suffering. 

And what better way to try to alleviate the suffering of human beings than being a doctor? I think everyone has to make a choice which will bring themselves inner peace and happiness as the best they can achieve it. 

No matter what you do, you will have an opportunity to impact other people's lives, just by who you are and the way you act.",3,498,161
"So today, I was giving a swim lesson and I had a very difficult person to teach today who wasn't listening. And it made me very frustrated at that person. But overall, it made me have to go back and try something new and adapt to the situation. Although I was annoyed a little bit, but overall I did get $50, so it was worth it in the end.","The first day of shadowing my boss went well at my new job with a service provider. The second day did not go as well. The day started out happy. He had a good day at school. We went to a well-known store, where he likes to go on Fridays. As we were going inside, things seemed a little off, but we pushed on.

As we got inside, the first meltdown occurred, but we were able to continue on with our visit. He got angry and started running full speed at each of us. He would sit and then jump up. Then, he would run full over to one of us while punching or biting. This went on for about 20 minutes. We were trying to protect ourselves, the client, and any innocent people around.

There was a man sitting behind us, in the corner of the eatery. Afterwards, we took him home with little to no violence.

I came home and realized that he had also grabbed at my neck and my ribs were also bruised. The minute I walked into my own home, I just sat in my husband's arms and cried. Then, I went to lay down with an ice pack on my stomach to stop the bruising.",2,79,241
"So, about two weeks ago, I went to do an open water swim, which I haven't done in four years. So over the summer, I did quite a bit of swimming and working out to make sure I was in shape for the event. And then I got there, and there were tons of people. It was a two-day thing. I swam on the second day, but overall, I successfully finished it, and I got second place in my age group. So, I got a medal to take home, which is pretty cool. But it's good to see that all the work I did paid off, and it was a super fun experience to do.","Today is the day of the competition, we were so excited but apprehensive about this trip. Ben has been preparing for several months but are you ever really prepared? I could not sleep last night because I was so worried about this event and I hoped I was able to support Ben accordingly.

How would I react if things don't go to plan? We have spent so much money and time on this. We got there around 6 am, traffic was shockingly less than expected! The parking lot was full already but we managed to grab a space thanks to someone leaving. We remembered to take everything along we needed: costume, skates, snacks.

Tony, my husband, was exhausted and suffering from a cold. My older son, S, was not thrilled about attending this event and wanted to go home. I was hoping I could bribe him to enjoy things by saying he could pick where we ate dinner. Ben was excited and not even remotely nervous. I was a wreck but pretending to be fine!

Ben got into costume around 7 am, practice ice went well, and he seemed happy and content. We then saw the kids he would be competing against and felt a pang of nerves: how could this little kid compete against kids much bigger and stronger than him?! He did not seem fazed at all.

Another boy and his family were there, but they were not remotely friendly; they kept glaring at us, which made me feel irritated and also nervous. One of Ben's friends, a little girl, skated and did ok but did not win; she came 4th in her event. This made me worry for Ben and start telling myself this whole trip was a waste of money.

It was time for Ben to skate, and we all held our breath; he did an amazing job, and we were not sure if it was good enough to win, but it was good. Ben's coach said, ""he has got this, he will win,"" and we waited for the scores, trying not to get too excited. The scores took forever to be announced, but when they were, sure enough, he had won!

It was time to calm down and congratulate the other skaters on their skates and try not to appear too boastful. We waited for the medal ceremony but heard nothing. We then had the medal ceremony, which was incredibly rewarding, and then the event was over!

We were exhausted and went home. And it was still only 10:30 am!",3,135,489
"So, about two years ago, I was in a pretty challenging course with optional homework. I took the option and didn't do any of those homework because it didn't affect my grade. But then, coming up to the exam, I thought I knew everything that I needed, and the exam was a wake-up call where I didn't do so well. And looking back at the optional homework problems, they were very similar. So, I learned from that just to do those problems which, in the end, helped me do better on the following exams. But that was probably the worst test I ever did because I wasn't very prepared.","Last semester, I took accounting. I fell into a really awful depressive episode and failed every single exam that I took for the class. Because of COVID, I could switch the class to Pass/Fail and it didn't hurt my GPA when I ultimately failed the class. 

I need the class as a prerequisite for business school, so I decided to take it again this summer. I was nervous because I failed so miserably last time. 

I got a therapist, focused on improving my mental health, put a lot of work in, and today, I passed the first exam of the Summer Semester with an 87.8%, which is B+! I'm beyond excited! This is the same test that I failed with a 46% last semester because I was having near constant suicidal thoughts. I couldn't function enough to study, and I didn't know any of it. 

I've dealt with depression for so, so long, and I convinced myself that I would never amount to anything. This gives me a little bit of hope. Maybe I can succeed. Maybe everything will be okay. Maybe I won't end up a failure.",4,128,221
"So, yesterday it was my birthday. I turned 23. And we went out to sushi last night, which was very fun. And I got a free dinner. And I went out with my friend, Amy. And a group of her friends whom I wasn't super close with, but I got to know all of them over dinner. And it was a very fun experience.","A few weeks ago, I went to dinner with my boyfriend and my best friend. I'd known my best friend since we were preteens, and this was the first time they had met. It went really well! I'd been dating him for nearly a year, and it had taken quite some time for our schedules to line up. I think this delay in meeting gave me some pent-up anxiety about it finally happening.

My friend texted me asking if I'd like to get dinner, and I let her know that I was with my boyfriend at the time. We got burgers and wings at a place nearby. The food was great, but the company was better.

We ended up seeing a couple of people that my friend and I knew. When we finished eating, we spent some time speaking to them. It was nice to catch up with old friends.

Afterward, we went back to my friend's house, where my boyfriend fell in love with her dog. Seeing them interact was adorable since my dog is a senior and doesn't quite play as much.

It was great to spend time with two people I value and care about and to see them getting along so well. I'm looking forward to spending more time with the two of them in the future.",4,76,250
"So, over the last couple of days, I've been volunteering for International Orientation. It's for international students at MIT who have come from different countries. I met many new people, not used to interacting with so many people at once, but it was fine. All the new kids are very interesting to talk to and they have so many questions. I think I was able to help them with some of them. It's also great to get food from orientation because dealing with food over the summer hasn't been fun. But yeah, it reminds me of International Orientation last year when I was an incoming freshman. I was very terrified of talking to people because everything seemed like so much at once. But I made a lot of friends, and now lots of them are mentors too. And I hope we're able to show the kids a good time. Tomorrow is the last day of International Orientation, and after that all the other freshmen from the US will be here too, and soon school is going to start. I'm kind of excited for the next one.","Since I was four years old, I always had a dream of being a physician. And my community is a community that is in poverty, mostly farmworkers. My parents worked in the fields. They didn't have a high school education. I was really invested and dedicated to getting an education. I wanted to also make a statement to the community that I'm coming back.

There was always that dream of doing something to help others that motivated me to keep going. I had no plans of going to Harvard Medical School. In fact, my family didn't even know where Harvard was or anything else like that.

When my pre-med counselor at UCLA told me I should apply to Harvard, I asked her, ""Harvard? Where's that?'' She looked at me kind of strangely, but I said, ""You know, it's not like we have these conversations at our dinner table.''

As you can imagine, I'm very grateful, and 17 years later, now I'm back.",3,212,197
"One of my hobbies is origami, and I'm going to tell you about how I started getting into it. I think that started when I was around 14 or 13. And one day, the idea of making a paper dragon popped into my head. I'm not sure where that came from, so I scoured the internet. I went on YouTube and tried to find a video of origami dragon instructions or a tutorial. I wanted a model that looked cool, and I wasn't really thinking about how difficult it would be to make.\n\nIn the end, I settled on some pretty complex models and tried to make them. Since I had never really done origami before, except for simple paper planes and unpapercrafts, it was very difficult. I'm talking about hundreds of folds, all made with great precision. So I tried over and over for a day, and then another one, and then it went to a week. I must have tried 20 or 30 times, each one taking hours. And then I couldn't go to finish. I even traveled a bit that week, and even during the journey, I was folding and folding and folding. I tried to fold that model so many times that at some point, I committed most of the folds to memory.\n\nAfter about a month of trying, I was finally able to finish making the model. It was very satisfying to have finally got it done. And that sparked my love for origami, and I went on to make many, many more models. And I still enjoy doing origami to this day. I also want to learn to design my own models and learn about the interesting math behind origami and research done in the field. But I think most of all, I just enjoy the process of folding and creating something with my hands. Once the model is finished, it feels like it's over, and I'm just looking for a new one to start working on.","I took a calculus course, and I had this amazing teacher who taught the entire thing through computer programming. It was visual, and for the first time ever, I was able to understand math. It bridged my love of computer-generated imagery, and then what I started noticing is that there are these patterns in the world that you could model and stimulate, and there's some harmony and beauty in there, and it was linguistic. Writing code is language, it's like poetry. It's like manipulating grammar. 

I think it's a very similar set of skills to a poet, and people don't really realize that. People tell you art and math have nothing to do with each other. But I had this experience where someone showed me math like an artist.",3,377,150
"Okay. So here\'s a story I heard when I was a kid, and I think it\'s from an old Buddhist tradition. But I really like the story, and I still think about it occasionally. It\'s pretty meaningful to me. So here we go.\n\nIn the forest next to a big Kingdom, there lived a huge herd of deer. Their leader was the King Deer, with magnificent horns and a golden glimmering coat. One look, and you could tell he was the King of the deer.\n\nThe deer had one problem. The King of the neighboring Kingdom would like to hunt, and he would hunt with his soldiers, courtiers, and ministers. They would slay tens of deers every day. And to put an end to this madness, the deer came up with this lottery system approved by the King. Every day, the deer would all pick a leaf at random. And the deer with the most holes on the leaf would be sent as a sacrifice to the King. This way, the King of the Kingdom would not hunt the deer.\n\nSo the system is put into effect, and for many days, weeks, months, and years, the deer would pick a leaf every day and one would be sent to die.\n\nOne of these days, the King Deer heard some noise and went to investigate. He saw a few other deer ganging up on one doe and bullying it. He asked them, ""Why are you doing this?"" And they said, ""Today, it is this doe\'s turn to be sacrificed to the humans, and she\'s refusing to go.""\n\nThe conscience of the King Deer stirred. Is this an unfortunate fate that has led them to this cruel system? One where, by mere bad luck, one is sent to die? However, the system is the same for every deer, and they can\'t show favor to one doe or another. So, he asked, ""Why do you refuse to go to the humans?""\n\nThe doe pleaded, ""Please let me live another week. You see, the doe is pregnant, and her child will be born soon. And she doesn\'t want it to enter the world only to die with her. She wants someone else to go that day instead.""\n\nThe King hears her, and he realizes that he cannot send this doe and her child to die. Two lives gone where only one should be. But he also knows that he can\'t send any other deer in their stead, for that would be unfair to them.\n\nSo the dear King realizes and chooses to go himself. He sacrifices himself. Once the King sees him, he realizes at once that this is the King of the deer, and he is shocked. And goes hunting no more in the forest.\n\nHe sees the fragility and the vulnerability. And he realizes that the King sacrificed himself to save the life of an unborn child. The human King realizes that he can\'t hunt the deer anymore and is moved by the sacrifice of the deer King. And the deer are now free to live again.\n\nI really like this story because it shows that mercy is very powerful. And sometimes, you do have the power to make someone\'s life better, to help them. And maybe it will not be as hard of a sacrifice as what the King of the deer did. But in our own small way, we can help.","When I was a kid, my father used to take me to watch trials actually, and there was something just about the whole kind of excitement and snapping victory from the jaws of defeat, the great cross-examination that brings us witness to tears.

I really think that law is an instrument for social change, and growing up, it was always part of my vision of my life that social change would be part of it.

When I wake up in the morning, one thing I know for sure is I'll be there. And if I try to find things in my life that make waking up exciting, rewarding, satisfying, then I'm gonna pursue those things in my life.",3,653,134
"So, I was having a conversation with a friend today about how art is a very essential thing for humans. It's somewhat like pure expression of human spirit. But unfortunately, we sort of tend to restrict human or performers of art to only the very best. The people who become painters are the best at painting, the people who are the musicians are the best at music, and so on. And Project Trooper, we talked about participatory music, where the audience is part of the music as well. And it's just a thing that people do, as opposed to being an exclusive stage for professional musicians. So my friend brought up this study, which I thought was really interesting. In an Indigenous community in Peru, music-making is highly participatory. And an ethnomusicologist conducted a study there once. So any male community member is welcome to perform with pipes or flutes with his community, and anyone is welcome to dance. So, one time when the author of the study was at one of these events, there were two folks from the community who performed with extremely out-of-tune flutes. However, it seemed like everyone was having fun. The author of the study, coming from a very different background from the West, was driven crazy by the out-of-tune flutes and tried to stand as far away from them as possible. But he was shocked that none of the other players felt any or gave any indication that anything was wrong, and no one discouraged their participation. And later, he had a conversation with another professional musician about how to tune, and even he said he cannot bring himself to point out that the flutes were out of tune. So, this is very different from the society that I'm used to, which is where only the best are expected to perform, and music is often a way for the most talented people to showcase their talent. But since art is willing to grow to the human experience, isn't it better for music to be participatory? And you should probably be more accepting of all kinds of skill levels taking part in art instead of just putting the best on a pedestal. On the flip side, I also think that there should be people pushing art to its boundaries. And of course, that can't be everyone. I just think, and my friend thinks too, that everyone should get a chance to participate in music, just like that community. And curve.","Women have been pretty much hidden in the shadows as creators and as creative scientists, even though we have built things, like Grace Hopper. She created a whole computer language. If you go even further back to Ada Lovelace, she's the first real computer scientist at all.

When I went to school in the mid-80s and I started college, there's just a handful of girls in the engineering school. And I had no professors that were female, I certainly had no professors of color in the school of engineering.

And I stumbled across this idea of the lack of women and women of color in technology. And the pivotal turning point for me was really my daughter having the same interest in computer science and her sharing the same thing that I experienced professionally, that she felt kind of alone.

But it planted a seed that this was a problem that was affecting me deeply. I really didn't have an idea that I was gonna create an organization to address it. It took me almost a whole year of just gnawing on this idea, talking to folks, before I actually jumped.",3,470,213
"I'm going to tell you about the time I moved when I was eight, maybe nine. I think it was in elementary school, and I think that's what got me into reading and learning. So I just started school, maybe finished first grade in the middle of second grade, so maybe I was only seven. We moved homes, so it was still in the same city, but I didn't know any of the kids in the department we were looking into. And all my friends in the neighborhood were no longer there. So eventually, I did make a few friends, but in the beginning, there was not really much to do outside because I didn't know anyone. So I was at home. We happened to have a bunch of books at home, or like random encyclopedia books. And I decided to start reading them. And they were fun, and I liked learning about things around the world. And since it wasn't through school or I wasn't being forced to do it, I just thought it was fun. And if I forgot stuff, it was okay. Unlike school where you have to remember everything or try. So it was just fun, and I just wanted to accumulate a bunch of knowledge. And it was fun to throw it out randomly. And I always obsessed over it. I really liked that. And so it got me into reading. And then eventually, I started reading stories and fiction and stuff too. I haven't been reading as much these days, but I still love learning things. That stuck with me. It also helped me at school, somehow surprisingly, because later in higher classes, I would come across the same things again that I'd already seen in encyclopedias before, just through browsing. And it made school much easier for me. Yeah, my teachers are always kind of surprised that I've read this in some random, obscure book somewhere. That feeling of just learning things for the fun of doing it and satisfaction in doing it is something that I really want to keep with me.","Monday, my daughter started ""Big Girl School""!!! She has officially entered Kindergarten! Being in school isn't new to her though. She has been in Pre-K for a year, so she is used to getting up, putting on a uniform, and even being around the big kids. She was very excited to start Kindergarten.

I, however, am not ready for her to be so ready. She went to bed early at 7 PM, and the lights went off! I woke her up to our traditional ""Wake Up Song"". I've been singing her this song since she was a baby; this stirs up the emotions knowing she is now a ""big kid"". Sometimes she sings along, sometimes she pulls the covers over her head.

I also got up early to cook breakfast. Our daily breakfast consists of egg whites, turkey bacon, and fruit. Every once in a while, I will let her eat her favorite cereal, but we keep it healthy! She only ate a little bit. I reckon she was nervous.

So, we grabbed her sparkly book bag, lunch box that looks like a purse, and her huge shopping bag of school supplies and headed to school. I am very blessed that her school is only 5 minutes from our home. We got there in no time, and I walked her inside.

The teachers had the kids sectioned off in the cafeteria by grade. I went to give her a kiss before she sat down, and she covered her face!!! Later, she told me that other kids would make fun of her. BUT IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN!!!

Looks like my baby girl is already grown!!!",2,406,335
"So here's something I wrote about Doors, but it's really sort of a metaphor for irreversible things. There it goes. Imagine you're in the room, the kind of room which you never really think of leaving. There's a door, though. And in this otherwise perfect room, this door troubles you. You don't know what's on the other side? It might be paradise. It might be hell. It might be nicer than your room. It might be worse. It might bring you right back to where you are. Do you take the door? So the door turns out, it's just a doorway with one without one, you can always see the other side. And it looks like paradise. Since you can always return and everything will be exactly as it was before you left, you can choose to take the door. Just seems like an easy decision. I mean, if the paradise outside the window is an illusion, I can return and there's a safety net. And that's nice. So you could choose to take the door. Not much can go wrong. Okay. Now let's suppose the door was made of wood. So there's a door now, a real tangible one. You can't peek through. But you can still walk back if you take the door. You might enter paradise or you might rescind your house. You take the door. So out of ground this choice isn't much harder. Life in the room is nearly perfect, though, and would be at risk being thrust into hell for a chance of something better. I don't know. But in the end, you know you can always come back. So I take the door. Now suppose the door is made of glass. You can see the other side. And it's paradise. There's a lock, however, so if you leave the door, you will never return. All you have is the vision through the glass. So this is scary because it's permanent. And the glass lets you catch a glimpse of what's outside, but you can never really be sure until you go there. But you also don't need to leave immediately. I can stay in my perfect room for however long I want. And then take the door. Now, suppose the door is made of metal. You can't see through it and it will lock so you can only choose to exit and never return. Do take the door. Now this takes are much higher because you don't know what's beyond the door and you can never return, but you still have the option of waiting for long. You can spend your entire life in your perfect room and then take the door when you have nothing to live. But now imagine you have to do the whole thing again, with all these different doors, but you only have one night to decide whether you take the door at all if you do want, if you want to. It might be the best decision you ever make or the worst one. Maybe you never know what you missed. I can't decide whether I want to take the door in that one.","I'm a volcanologist and a scientist. So how did I get into that in the first place? I've just always loved volcanoes. My mom can tell you stories of me as a two-year-old that I don't remember, of talking about volcanoes and lava.

In high school, when everyone says, ""Follow your dreams,"" I said, ""Well, why not?"" I think you have to be brave on some level.

There's no point in getting down or depressed or pessimistic about things because there's always another option forward. One door opens when another closes, or something to that effect.

Sometimes that other door will never open until you say, ""This is a dead end,"" and close the door. And you don't see that other option until you say, ""All right, I don't know what my options are, but this one is not it,"" shut the door.",5,623,181
"Blue. Today, I attended the first lecture of one of my classes this semester, which is quite fun. The class is about J.R.R. Tolkien, the famous author of The Lord of the Rings. He was also a great scholar of medieval literature, languages, philology, and stuff. He had conversations with friends like C.S. Lewis, who, at least in the beginning, was an atheist and didn\'t believe in the value of things like God and metaphysics. But he later changed. He later converted. But that\'s not what I want to talk about. Today, we read a part of a poem written by Tolkien, which wanted to explain why metaphysics are important, because C.S. Lewis was of the opinion that metaphysics are just beautifully crafted lies. They have no truth in them, and therefore, they\'re not worth anything. And Tolkien\'s response was to compose a long poem about why metaphysics are useful. But one part that particularly caught my attention was the beginning, where Tolkien describes this fictional character called Miso Metis, who doesn\'t believe in the value of metaphysics. He says the person looks at natural objects like trees and just labels them ""trees"" and walks across the Earth as though everything is determined mathematically. Atoms move as they\'re expected, and every outcome is predictable, as if the world is just code regimented in a way where destined atoms are each moment\'s flame. So, it\'s like a very lifeless worldview. And he contrasts this with a different one in which he believes in a God and has a belief that there\'s some purpose beyond our comprehension, and God who made everything in the world. And these are not merely just objects that work according to mathematical principles, but more than that. I think this struck me because, like the professor mentioned, MIT students tend to have this worldview. And I think he\'s right. I think many people tend to view the world, at least here, as deterministic, a bunch of things that have predictable outcomes, and they can try and optimize for plans within their control to take advantage of this nature of the world. And they treat life as sort of an optimization problem, trying to get the maximum or some sort of maximal outcome. I don\'t think all MIT students are like this. I think a large chunk of them aren\'t, but there\'s definitely some subset which does think like this. I disagree with that worldview. I agree with Tolkien, and it seems very cold and regimented because if you treat life like an optimization problem, you would miss many things like art, which, in some sense, is a completely useless expression of the human spirit. But somehow, we need it. We need it in our lives. Although maybe a lot of it would never have been created with a completely scientific and rational point of view of the world. I also think it might not be worth micro-optimizing things and that part of life is experiencing imperfections and decisions. But maybe that\'s just me. I\'m not sure.","I was always interested in experimental sound, and I was interested in new sounds. So I always came up with my own strategies for composing. And one of those strategies, for music, is that if I compose it, I can play it. Anything in my environment is a tool that I can use to make music.

Number one piece of advice, get out of your own way. I don't think you discover who you are, you make who you are. People are always saying, ""I have to discover who I am."" No, you have to do things and become that person.

I always say that art is a tool for living, but this body is a tool for living. Everything is forward, you're creating forward action. You're not discovering who you are, you are creating who you are, you're going on this trip, you're gonna do these things, and it's a powerful thing.",5,591,187
"Two: So here are some of my thoughts on being boxed and also starting out. Two sort of different but similar things. So let's start with being boxed in. Being boxed means that everyone around you, or at least many people around you, have a certain preconception of how you act and what you'll do. And it's quite hard to change their perspective because it's not really in your control. But whenever you do something which is outside the box they put you in, it's jarring to them and they don't like it. They try to make you not do that and you stay in your box, which is kind of awful because that means it's hard to change. Because people would find it odd if you try to change and people also make wrong assumptions about you. And sometimes they don't tell you about it and it can affect things adversely for a really long time. Conversely, people also try to fit in a lot, having sort of idiosyncrasies or different characteristics. As we heard, I'm humans naturally seek some sense of belonging, I guess because they're social animals, and that leads into fitting in. And this leaves the suppressing parts which make each person unique. And that's a little sad, actually, I think. A friend pointed out that this also depends on what kind of social structure you grew up in. For example, if you grew up in a more collectivist society, like say somewhere in East Asia or India, like me from childhood, you're expected to behave in the normal way and there are many more rules about fitting in with everyone else. And as a result, you sort of double up less, I think you develop less idiosyncrasies. When you're older, there isn't really much to suppress because you already fit in just because of the way you've grown up. Of course, fitting in in one of those societies, coming from the outside with the only unique characteristics, will be much harder. Conversely, somewhere like the US, which is very individualistic, there's less of an expectation to fit in, but as a result, people develop their own unique behaviors. And some of these will be seen as extreme for people coming from more collective societies, and they would stand out. But standing out is seen as not a bad figure, which is great. I'm not sure if it's great but seems alright. So yeah, I've not had many experiences with standing out, at least that have affected me in a negative way. However, I do feel boxed in a lot. And once I started taking notice of when that's happening, I realized it happened nearly every day and definitely many times a week. And I'm not easily bothered by most things, but this is starting to get to me. And last week, I snapped at someone I perceived as boxing me, and I normally don't do that. And I still think why that bothers me so much. And I think the main reason is it prevents you from changing and doing things you find interesting just because it doesn't fit in your box. Even today, someone told me that when I told them about talking to you, they said they wouldn't have expected me to have done something like that. Basically, I'm not in their box. And I really don't like that. Not many things annoy me, but that is one thing that does.","I absolutely hate myself with everything I have. I despise the way I look, I hate the way I think, I loathe every day I breathe. I can't remember a time I didn't hate myself. I was a child and never left the house because I was embarrassed of myself. I didn't have any friends because I thought that being seen with me, the outcast, the introvert, would lessen them.

I have friends now, I love them, but nobody knows anything about the warfare that takes place in my mind. Every moment I exist I hate, and it's my fault for letting it reach this point.

I hate that I'm fat even after countless diets; I hate my dandruff, that even though I basically scrape the scalp off my head every single day I shower, it doesn't go away; I hate my nose; I hate the way I feel about everything; I hate how I have no talent and just am; I hate that I'm not a good friend; I hate how I'm complaining about stuff that doesn't even matter when there are people with real problems.

I'm so drained of keeping this front that nothing gets to me and I'm not vulnerable. It's killing me. The thing is that I can't even ask for help - I don't deserve it.

If I didn't hate myself, I'd be empty because it consumes everything. My hatred is all I am. I have tried to better myself, I have done everything I could with the knowledge I had, and it never was enough. All I could ever do is watch and love people from afar because God forbid they find out I feel something and get disgusted.",3,677,335
"About. So. The story is about my friend who just is leaving Cambridge. And. Is traveling like a nomad, like he's going to Italy, and then he's meeting her family there. And then she will be like she doesn't know where is she going to keep traveling. And. I have been regretting not traveling this summer. So, yeah, I just feel like I just had a very busy summer. And I am regretting not traveling.","I was dating this woman who was really adventurous and really wanted to go to Japan and I didn't really know what else to do, and I was like, ""Sure."" I happened to luck into a job working for an English-language newspaper there writing about environmental issues, which was like the coolest job I never deserved.

They were looking for somebody who spoke Japanese. I managed to convince them I could get it done without speaking Japanese, and somehow they fell for it. And it was a great job. I got to travel all over Asia.

That was profound for me as a person because I'd never really been in a place where I was different from everyone else. You're a different person once you've spent some time abroad and learned from other people.

Once you've changed your perspective to understand that there's more than one way to think about the world, you can't ever really change back.",3,92,181
"One, so I think it is just like one of the things. That. What was that? Like? I was talking to some other girl, and she was like, she was getting concerned about it. That, why do you talk? And then I told her something that happened a day before, and she was like, ""Why didn\'t you tell me yesterday?"" And at the time it happened. So she just said like whatever has happened, like she wants to know at that moment and that second. But given that everyone is busy, if I tell her anything beyond a day, she feels like, okay, that is something you\'re telling. I think she misses acknowledging the fact that she got to know from me, and she delves into the part that, ""oh, I missed something knowing yesterday."" And then I am hiding other things as well, and she feels that she\'s not getting to know the entire thing.","I have a friend B who I have known for around a year now, and her mom is the worst person I have ever met. Here are just some of the things she has done that really pissed me off.

B tells her mom everything. And then her mom tells my mom everything. Now my mother knows all about my problems, worries, and wishes. She constantly annoys both me and my family by shoving B's grades and school stuff in our faces. When B does something that I forgot/didn't do, she mentions it whenever she can. On a call? Meeting in real life? She has to bring it up.

She forced me to study with B many times, even when I already knew everything. She humiliated me in front of family many times. She acts like I'm a dumb child.

It might seem like I'm overreacting, but she has done this so many times. So I cut all contact with her. I stopped texting her, I told B to not tell her a word about me, I stopped showing up when we had to meet, and I stopped answering her calls.

It felt great, it felt like I was finally free again, and it's the best feeling I have ever felt, and I don't regret a thing.",1,189,252
"So my story is about my feelings that got activated about the feelings of jealousy that got activated when I got to know that a friend of mine, who is younger to me, got a job. And I just feel that I am running behind in my life, certain aspects. And there are people, and people around me, who are like having the same level of achievement at a younger age. So I just feel like jealousy and not good, and that I think stems from my limitation somewhere.","I have gone from a happy, vibrant kid to a sad, tired adult. My own mother has said she doesn't even recognize me anymore. ""Where has my 'my name' gone?"" is something she said this week.

I blame it on my parents. My family is very close-minded. Often times people in my class in middle school would ask me to go play with them, and my parents almost always wouldn't let me. They didn't let me sleep at other people's houses. I had to make up excuses every time, but after 2-3 times ""I'm going to the cinema with my brother"" doesn't work anymore. The kids didn't invite me anymore, and I barely had any friends left.

In high school, things changed a bit. I changed my personality and became a class clown. People laughed at my jokes, and I gained lots of friends. However, the same thing as in middle school happened. Friends asked me to go to parties, my parents wouldn't let me, and I was cast out.

Now I'm in university and have virtually no friends. The thing that hurt me the most was that people were interested in getting to know me often until I've had to reject their offer to go out every time.

A recent example was a girl I met about a year ago. When I met her, we immediately clicked and talked for days on end, but I could never go and meet her because she lived far away and my parents wouldn't allow it. The conversations slowed down and stopped.

I've had opportunities to get closer to people, but every time things are going somewhere, it is put to a halt by my restrictive parents. Now I fear that I will never be able to engage in any long-term relationship ever.

I am thinking about my future a lot, and all I want is a house, a wife, kids, and some good friends. And every day that scenario is looking less and less plausible in my mind.",1,99,395
"Done. So, I am moving from my current location to where my girlfriend lives. And my plan was to send the boxes of my stuff to her place, that is her house. And she initially mentioned that ""you really need to send those multiple boxes"". Then we kind of figured it out. And the last time we talked about it, it was more humorous, like ""oh, really? Where are you sending those boxes?"". ""Oh, my address."" ""Okay."" And this time yesterday, it was again that sense of ""thing"" where she doesn\'t want me to send those boxes. And she said, ""wasn\'t it just one box? Are you sending multiple boxes to my house?"". And it makes me feel that I am dependent on her for shipping those boxes and I am asking her for a favor. And it makes me feel like it just pushes my self-respect in that sense. And I don\'t really feel good about it. And I have been angry all night and all day.","Today was a terrible day for me. My coworker, who we will call the big ""W,"" is usually always mean to me. However, today she was the worst. It was our big Christmas party, and she micromanaged everyone at work today. She started openly complaining about only she was smart, only she did any real work, etc. 

Everyone had told me since I started here how terrible she was and how badly they wanted her to be fired. Despite this, no one would ever do anything about her or talk about her until she left the room. 

Finally, I snapped and decided not to sit down and take it like everyone else. While she started insisting she told me to do something I was never told, I told her to her face she never said that. She lost it and started to scream at me while she did that my boss just ignored it like he usually did. 

I decided I had enough of a boss that wouldn't do anything and handed him my resignation, which was more than he deserved. He tried to convince me it was cowardly to leave, but I told him it was cowardly to not fire her. 

She kept harassing me through the night until that point, then my boss decided to take her to the back room and yell at her for having a coworker finally quit over her. She came back out and stayed quiet for the whole rest of the night. 

I left that job and felt good about leaving; they all already didn't like her, but it was made worse once she actually cost them a good employee who at least tried their best, which was more than half of the people they hired did.",1,206,328
"So, I was trying to send my stuff as I\'m moving to my girlfriend\'s house, but my girlfriend objected to that, saying that her parents don\'t like me sending my stuff to her house. And if she was not clearly telling me why because she was like, ""I\'ll be more hurt if I listen to that point."" And now I am wondering why her parents talk about something hurtful to me. I have spent time with them and I thought it was all good. But I am having very broad questions on this. So guide me too.","The people I've dated in the past always seemed to want more. My second ex seemed like he wanted a girl that was more physically attractive.

My first ex seemed to like his friend more than me. He seemed to bring her up a lot in conversations, and he seemed to genuinely like her as a person. I mean, I get it, since he said he used to ""simp for her."" This hurts the most because it was the longest relationship I've been in.

I'm so upset for putting myself in these two relationships. I don't understand why I did that to myself. It's not worth the flashbacks and pain from time to time, but I guess you learn from it and move on.

I guess it's not too bad, but it definitely hurts.",3,112,157
"One, my story is about my nephew. I had a very long conversation with him today. He is young right now. He's just starting his college. And he has been, like, decently a good student. Like in the initial school days, he was not that great, but he actually picked himself up and got good marks. But now, as I've been talking to him, I feel that he's targeting his aim too low. And he's just happy with anything. And he doesn't have a lot of cognitive sense to himself. And I get very angry at things when I hear that. These are so easy. Why don't people think about it? And I get irritated and I shout at him. And then I feel that I'm not treating him well. And I might not be a good uncle to him.","I have a friend B who I have known for around a year now, and her mom is the worst person I have ever met.

"Yeah, I\'ve been reaching out to more people and seeing if I can talk to more people in this New York City and get to know more people around here. I had a dinner with a friend last week, which was really nice. It was really good to have common friends and then catch up. We had Korean food, which was really nice. And I think she is Chinese. I don\'t think she ever had Korean food, I don\'t know. It was very new for her, so it was really nice just to explore something new together. She\'s a master student, so she\'s still studying. That was interesting to hear what she\'s been doing and what? Yeah, I just graduated so I could see, I could see whatever she was going through, like how I was also going through the same things and how difficult it is to start studying again, and then be in this new space where you\'re supposed to perform so much, but then you\'re also trying to get somewhere. But it\'s also really confusing and scary. So I could empathize with that, I think. But then, yeah, it was interesting. I did feel like not heard in that whole conversation. It was very one way, she didn\'t ask a lot about me, which is fine. But it was like a network dinner, and not like ""Oh, friend"" kind of thing, which is also fine. I think not every person you meet is going to be your friend, but it was like a new thing to try, which was nice.","There's this girl in my French class, and she's very sweet and kind.

And I don't know, it was such an honest, beautiful conversation; I hadn't had one of these in a while. We also share the same life goals, hobbies, and passions.

After our chat, I went for a walk, and I kept on thinking of some stuff she had said. I felt quite happy because I wanted to keep on talking with her and discussing all of these wonderful, lovely ideas.

"Like, I think one story or just like an interesting thing which I observed, I have is, it\'s all important to have representation at work or at the places that you are at because that sort of makes different people feel comfortable and more accepted, and more accepted, that\'s the word. For example, if I\'m in a different country or a different state, which I don\'t know anything about, and if I\'m walking there, if I\'m around people who have different experiences in life, I feel it takes a lot of time to just get comfortable around them, to feel more confident about yourself, to know and see how you can pick one and survive, but also thrive there. It takes a lot of time and it\'s helpful just to be aware of that and not be like ""Oh, there\'s something wrong with you,"" but they\'re just like a different environment and the people are different. Everyone\'s trying.","I started as a Hispanic woman in sports reporting. My very first job, I had someone sit down and say to me, you know why you got this job, right? The implication was because I was a Hispanic woman. I said, because I am amazing.

There's a lot of negativity. Don't listen to those people and ignore them and use them as motivation. It's about being willing to figure out what's best for you and go on your own path.

I had never been to the city before or met her parents, so it was going to be a big weekend. We went up on a Friday after work, making the 4.5-hour drive through the Pennsylvania mountains.

This was a trip we had talked about for a while, but never could find a free weekend as we are both very busy with work. Finally, we were able to find a free weekend for both of us and booked everything very last minute. We started off getting dinner at an Italian restaurant with her parents, which went really well! I was a little nervous going into the dinner, but her parents were very nice and it was a relaxing dinner.

After dinner, we went to our hotel in the city. Saturday, I did not think we had any plans, but I was surprised that my girlfriend had a whole day planned out. I was surprised and happy she spent the time to plan a whole fun day for me. We spent the day going to museums, breweries, parks, and ending the day riding a tram up a mountain for a view of the city and ate dinner up there. It was a really fun day, and the whole thing made me really happy.

The next day, we went to a Pittsburgh Steelers game. The stadium was really cool, and it was an exciting game. The fans of the Steelers were so passionate and enthused, it made the experience very memorable.

After the game, we drove home - I drove while my girlfriend slept. It was a tiring weekend as we had a lot of activities, but it was great nonetheless.",3,51,327
"Hello. The story I'd like to tell is about my desire to have my foot heal faster than it is.

However, I assumed that I would heal faster and that it wouldn't be as painful as it was, the recovery that is.\n\nWell, six weeks in, the doctor said things were coming along smoothly and that I could start doing some weight bearing and start physical therapy.

"One experience I'd like to share is that of traveling as a lone person. On one trip to Spain, I lived there for several months without knowing anyone, but I had contacts, so I wasn't alone. And one morning, on my way someplace, it was a Sunday morning, and as I was walking down the street, I learned something about the Spanish culture in the area that I was in. That staying out late, and perhaps I mean by late, I mean to dawn beyond the madrugada, was a common experience that people didn't feel badly about, especially when they had overexcesses in drinking and were sleeping on the street. So, I was walking down this street on a sidewalk in Avocado and I started seeing lots of people sleeping, relying on the sidewalk. And it's a little disconcerting because the environment that I hailed from, that wasn't a common experience. I didn't live in a city while living in Boston. Boston kind of goes quiet after midnight, 01:00 in the morning. South Florida, where I came from, there wasn't really no city place that you went. Maybe Miami, but nobody really went to Miami. You stayed in the fun areas where you were near. It wasn't a city like Boston. Let's put it that way. And as I'm walking down the street, I see these people in various states of deep sleep or slowly waking. Get a little bit disconcerted. I didn't see any women. It was all men. And I started to get a little bit nervous, but I was by myself. So I had to figure out how to do this. And so I chose to walk down the middle of the street. It was interesting to me to see how I adapted when I put distance between me and that which was uncomfortable or discomforting. Putting that distance between me and the sidewalk by walking down the middle of the street. Yes, I had some fear that perhaps somebody would wake from their slumber and I don't know, verbally. I really didn't think so much physically, but just verbally. I'm not a confrontational person. So I have often thought about that when you put distance between yourself and that which makes you uncomfortable. Kind of avoidance. But yeah, there's my story.","I was in South Florida, and I was trying to figure out, do I take the path that a lot of my fellow Colombian immigrants at the time took? Maybe stay home with parents, go to community college, and kind of hang around the Colombian-American community. Or I had the choice to explore and see something totally different. 

So I got into college, and I didn't know really what I wanted to do. The journey became, what thing can I put my heart and soul into for the next 30 years? I went scuba diving in Australia. 

Talking to the captain of the ship, he said, ""I was in a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, and I saw the ocean for the first time, and I was completely sold."" The ocean was that thing that called him that he loved to do and knew that he wanted to do for the rest of my life. And I was like, I need to find that, I need to find my ocean. 

For me, business started becoming that. Looking backwards, I had started eight businesses before I got to college. So at Emplify, our goal, our vision is to help improve the lives of 1 million people through more meaningful work. 

Our data will show them how this team is sick in terms of engagement and really their heart and mind not being into their work. And then, we show them something, they do something about it, leadership changes something, and then the work lives of employees are better.",1,452,294
"My family. I had a family of four siblings, two older sisters. My brother, who was eleven years older than me, and then me. And there was kind of a dichotomy in the household. The two older sisters, they were accomplished, very beautiful. And they were in their own world. And I was sickly and a bookworm. Stayed at home all the time. And the only person there for me was my brother. And even though he was eleven years old, he always made time for me. And he did things with me every Saturday afternoon at the matinee on TV. We\'d watch The Three Stooges. And we\'d watch horror movies, those old Universal Horror movies. And he just made me feel special. And the song that reminds me of him most is ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" because when I was nine years old, I attended his high school graduation. And no, I was seven years old. I\'m sorry. I attended his graduation. And when he stepped off stage, he received his diploma. And then he received a notice from the army recruiter that he was drafted to go to Vietnam. So the song by Peter, Paul, and Mary, ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"", became the song my mother and I would always listen to and think of him. And it just was very poignant and it meant a lot. And it was just I was bullied and a very sad child. And he brought sunshine to my life and spent time with me and loved me. So I felt very happy. But that song my mother and I would always cry. So anyway, that was my first story to introduce you and to tell you a little bit about me. Fortunately, I\'m a lot better but I just wanted to tell you that song means a lot to me and my brother meant a lot. So thank you for letting me share.","I didn't really plan on going to graduation. I never planned to go to graduation. I said I was getting out and never ever looking back. It costs money just to travel there and have the outfit. And I don't like it there, nor do I like the people. I look back on my time there as struggle and pain.

But I looked at Facebook the morning of graduation, and there was a small pain. Seeing two of my almost friends in their caps and gowns, with their families, made me slightly sad for what I didn't have. Finishing didn't feel like a celebration, and maybe, had I gone, I could have made it be one. They had been through struggles similar to mine, and they were there, in the gowns, celebrating.

I could have gone and seen them off and gave that university and city where I spent so many years of my life a proper goodbye. So I sat there, looking at Facebook, thinking about how the last time I left I didn't know it was going to be the last time.

I realized that part of why I hadn't wanted to go was because most of my friends had graduated years before, and I wasn't really close to anyone else. Dragging them back for my graduation wasn't something I felt comfortable doing.

And I realized that somewhere deep inside, I had seen myself being dragged into graduation, begrudgingly going. But people had listened when I said no.

Facebook, ignoring privacy as usual, alerted one of my almost friends I was online. She sent me a message asking where I was and if we could meet to take photos together. When I told her I was not there, she expressed disappointment. She wrote me a message about how sad it was to not see me as she saw me as directly responsible for her even making it to graduation.

At the same time, other almost friends who had graduated previously were online congratulating the two. Upon seeing I was online, they wrote to me as well. One expressed congratulations to me and spoke of how she was glad I was finally free. The other spoke of how we would celebrate in the future, as I had celebrated her graduation with her, and she could not have gotten through without me.

And I told myself that I didn't need to be at that graduation because I had what I needed from it -- the people who understood how much it took and the feeling of being free of it.",2,377,486
"Well, I\'m going to tell you since my last story was kind of modeling, I will tell you a funny story. Well, my husband and I lived in Florida for quite some time. And we were on the beach. And there was a brand of suntan lotion that I had used before. They use it a lot in tanning salons, but it\'s also a really good suntanning lotion. So I grabbed it because I think it was like 15 or 18 SPF that we used all the time. And that day, I grabbed it. We put it on. We stayed out from about 10:00 a.m. We broke for lunch around noon and then remained out for another 3 hours. So we didn\'t eat that day on the beach and we stopped at a restaurant that we knew on the way home. And we noticed people looking at us really strangely. So I looked at him. He looked at me. We were still kind of sunblind from being out in the sun so long. So he looked behind me. I looked behind him so we couldn\'t figure it out. So we said, ""I said, I\'m going to go to the restroom and see if I look funny or anything."" And he said, ""Me too."" So the bathrooms were right next to each other. So I looked in the mirror and I said, ""Oh, my God."" And I heard from the other bathroom him exclaimed the same thing, ""Oh my God."" And what had happened is I had grabbed tanning accelerator instead of tanning lotion, and we were as red as lobsters. So long story short, if you are going to be in the Gulf of Mexico suntanning, you should make sure you\'re using proper suntanning lotion. Okay? That\'s it.","About two months ago, my family and I went to the beach in California. There was a beach volleyball tournament that we wanted to see. We got up early in the day and were already at the beach around 10 am. We swam, sunbathed, and hung out while we waited for the tournament to start. The weather was perfect, and it felt great that my family was together for the whole day. I got to catch up with my siblings since I had not seen them in a while. 

Then, the tournament started, and we nervously and anxiously watched and cheered on our favorite team. The team ended up winning, and we were so excited. Around 8 pm, we started packing up and walking home. 

When we got home, we realized we all got very badly sunburned. I guess in the excitement of it all, we forgot to reapply sunscreen throughout the day. We immediately went to the drugstore to get some aloe vera and pain killers. My brothers filled up the bathtub with a bunch of ice and soaked in it. We all got sunburned in the past, but never this badly. 

It was interesting to see how much we all helped each other. My brothers were wetting towels for everyone, and mom was making sure we were staying hydrated. I was in charge of the aloe, and my dad was entertaining us to distract us. 

We had plans to go to dinner that night; we even made reservations. We all wanted to go, so we started getting ready, but even the clothes were painful on our skin. Since we would all probably be cranky, we decided it is best to just cancel dinner and stay in. 

That day was so memorable to me because it started out as the best day I had in a long time, but then it ended with my whole family in excruciating pain. Despite everything, this day brought us all together as a family, and I am so happy it did.",5,350,380
"Okay. I was married when I was young, and unfortunately, my first husband had a heart attack at a young age. And I had two young children to take care of. I hadn\'t dated or been out with anybody for years. My children were growing up - my son was in college and my daughter was 16. And she decided that she liked heavy music, so she wanted to go to Ozzfest in Georgia. So, a friend of hers, the mother, and I drove them to Atlanta. And we went to Ozzfest.\n\nI was getting something to drink for the mother, the other mother, and myself. And I was standing there, and I saw this man with the most beautiful hair I\'d ever seen. It was really long and just beautiful, thick, and beautiful. And I told him, ""You have the most beautiful hair of anyone I\'ve ever seen. Excuse me."" And he said, ""Well, thank you."" And, ""You look like you totally don\'t belong here."" So, I said I laughed, and we talked a little more. And I went and sat back down. And a little while later, I happened to look on one of the stages, and I saw him on stage performing with this band. I didn\'t even know he was a musician. And after the set, he came up to me and he said, ""Do you have an email?"" And I gave him my email address. And we started corresponding. And I married him two years later. And he\'s my current husband. And it was a really strange day, but it was one of the happiest days of my life. So, that\'s how I met my husband. He was playing at Ozzfest.","A few years ago, I had a bit of a scare. My appendix ruptured on tour, and I came close to dying. And it was the same week that my first song went into the top 20. After more than 20 years of making music, we had a song, ""Say Hey I Love You."" And I'm on this gurney being wheeled down to perhaps my death.

And I get this text. ""Your song's in the top 20,"" and I'm like, it didn't even matter. I was like, whatever. I was like, I just wanna see my kids again. I wanna be with my family. And I can appreciate having made music for that long, that it's a nice thing to have a lot of people hear your song. But if I can't share with my family, it doesn't matter.

At this point in my life, I'm 48. I have two sons. I have one who's 27, and I have one who's 15. And I still feel like I'm 22 years old. I still have the same passion for what I do with music. And I have this life that I feel is fulfilling in so many ways that I feel happy most of the time.",4,346,252
"So yeah. So, I can share a story that happened recently. So, I went to Yosemite with my boyfriend two weeks ago. We went to see one of the biggest meteor showers during the year, and that was very fascinating. That was really my first time seeing so many meteors at one time. And then, however, a part of the sky was covered by clouds, so we couldn't see meteors throughout all the areas in the sky, but at least through a specific small area we have seen a lot of meteors, so I was pretty satisfied. And I was also very grateful for my boyfriend. He woke up so early at 3:00 a.m. and drove us up to the Glacier Point in Yosemite to catch the sunrise, which is very beautiful, although I was still sleeping all the way while he was driving. And then afterwards, we went on a little hike to the Mirror Lake. However, once we got to the Mirror Lake, it started to rain. So then the Mirror Lake was supposed to be very smooth on its surface so that it looks like a mirror. But because of the raining, the mirror was kind of rough. So it was a numb mirror, Mirror Lake. But we still got a little exercise by hiking towards it. So it was still very fun. And after that, we went home. That was a pretty fun trip. I want to share with you.","I went on a very memorable trip to Crater Lake, Oregon, on July 8th. It was particularly special because it was me and my girlfriend's 1-year anniversary. We stayed at the Crater Lake Lodge, which is normally a very hard venue to reserve. However, my girlfriend was very prompt and smart about reserving the space very early on, which allowed us to stay at the lodge.

To our surprise, we noticed there was snow amid the hot sun. The Crater Lake had an unforgettable view, and it was breathtaking. It is so hard to describe the emotions that we both felt. During the whole day, we drank a lot of wine to keep ourselves warm, and with the slight booze, it kept us rather excited throughout the day. We went on a couple of hikes throughout the day.

One thing that was on our bucket list was to jump into the lake, but that never ended up happening. This was because the roads were closed because there were some cracks and boulders that needed to be removed.

In the evening, the lodge was very cozy. However, with such a beautiful view of the sky, we ended up chit-chatting until 3 AM. Our next day was planned to go to Portland, and yes, we were exhausted, but we didn’t really mind.

This trip really got us thinking about developing our relationship, and thus it was truly unforgettable for both of us. I hope to go again another time and stay at the lodge with the lake view. That was the only downside because it was hard to reserve a spot, and we had to stay in the mountain view.

All in all, I hope to revisit my memory in the future.",4,279,331
"So I\'d like to tell a story about how I really got interested in robotics. There was this moment when I was in a Lego Robotics competition where I first realized that all robotics has the ability to help people. And even if the project that I came up with was super dumb back then, and it was absolutely not realistic at all, the fact that I realized that it could help is kind of what kept me going. So then in high school, I continued to do robotics. I continued to do outreach for robotics, to get people to get the same kind of insight on, like, ""Oh, I could actually do stuff with this."" And even now, I\'m still following that same passion for how robots can help people. And I\'m still doing it now.","So at Alchemy, we are taking the concept of chemistry and science and turning them into game-based learning tools for students and instructors, but in a way that allows for experimentation and play. The path was going toward academic chemistry. I was good at chemistry, I was good at research and all that stuff. But I realized that I always liked working with young people. So I actually, in 1994, went and worked at Detroit Country Day School, which is a private school.

And started my job there and loved it, and raised my children. They went through the school, they went to U of M. And after that, I started to sort of feel not as connected to my school as it used to be because my kids were gone. So I started to look for new things, and that was the beginning of Alchemy.

And if my learning tools can be shown to help students from everywhere get better, and there's like 50% of people that fail organic chemistry. If I could cut that down to 40%, I think that would be success. But this is not an easy path, it's really hard. But if you're solving a problem that you know needs to be solved, then the hurdles don't feel quite so high.",4,157,248
"Guys, so today I was watching an episode of Suits, and in Suits, there is a lawyer named Louis. The whole thing is a TV show that takes place in New York, in a law office. Louis is one of the lawyers who is constantly trying to be the best, and he always sees himself as inferior to Harvey, another character. And every time Louis tries to do some kind of payback for whatever Harvey did to him, it always ends up backfiring on him somehow. He always makes a bigger mess than what he started. What kind of resonated with me in this story is that it's not necessarily the greatest objective to try and be the best. Because if you are trying to be better than someone else, you're constantly competing and trying to undermine them or go against them. And while it can be healthy, to some extent, to have some competition, unhealthy competition doesn't make a lot of sense, and that kind of resonated with me. Because for so long, I competed in competitions for everything from math to science to robotics. And it was always like you had to be the best. And now, going past college, it doesn't make sense to try and be the best because everyone is doing something completely different from you. So just keep trying and undermining people will just backfire on you.","It's really easy to get caught up in believing that somebody else's life plan is the one that you should live by. I've been told authors don't make money, creative people don't make money. I thought if I get to the end of my life and what I've accomplished is paying off student loan debt and that's all I have to show for my time on the planet, I don't know that I could go to my grave peacefully.

One of the things I think is important to think about when you start to consider the voices of the critics and naysayers and the people who you worry about what they think is that they're not the ones that are gonna live with the consequences or the choices that you make.

They're not the ones day in and day out who go and do a job that you hate. At the end of your life, they're not the ones who are going to be living with the life that you've lived and that has always kind of stuck with me.

Compromising on what you want out of your life in order to silence a few people is a really high price to pay.",3,264,226
"So the play that I mentioned earlier, in the play, I take the role of a child who is really annoyed at having to do a service project, which is basically serving some burritos to a homeless population, and just really annoyed and frustrated and worried about my own material comforts. And then I realized that the homeless people can overhear me, and then I become super embarrassed and realize the fact that I can't really say bad things. I'm not supposed to say bad things about people because people might be hearing, and that wouldn't be very nice. And this kind of resonated with me because sometimes I do do things like that. Maybe not to that extent, but I don't want to load the dishwasher because I'm tired, but I need to load the dishwasher because maybe my mom is tired as well, and her arm is hurting, and therefore she can't do it. So I should probably help out. And it kind of just made me realize that, yes, sometimes I can be selfish, and I should be aware of that and not do that as often.","So, I grew up in the projects in Canarsie. Similar, I think, to the environments a lot of you might be used to: gun violence, gangs. I grew up on welfare for the first 17 years of my life. You have to find motivation to succeed every possible place you can. Even if it's a negative emotion.

When you start thinking about the negativity, about the stupid decisions you made, about the people who made you feel bad, turn that into fuel. Transmute your frustration into fuel.

There is this avatar or this person that says, you know, you're just like your mom. Your mom did nothing, you're going to be nothing, that's you. And you go, ""I can't wait to prove this person, like, it is going to mean so much to me when that person eats every single word and they have no idea how great I am, how much I give back, how much I help others, how positive my life is.""

So I'm not trying to become great to then hurt this person. I'm not trying to become great to hurt someone. I'm trying to become great, and I'm trying to find every possible tool to keep me moving forward because it's so easy to want to quit.",3,216,256
"I'm going to share something about work today. So, I've been doing an internship. It ends on this Friday. As part of the internship, my project has been basically to render a component on the page. And I spent probably six, seven, eight, probably eight weeks of my twelve-week internship trying to get this thing to render on the page. And I've tried multiple different things on, how do I get this to work? Everything from giving it the bare minimum to giving it almost everything it could possibly take. And it still doesn't work. And I guess in this case, good enough is much better than perfect because there is no way I would have been able to finish this project in twelve weeks. And I recognize that now. And it was frustrating at times. But understanding that I did enough work so that someone else can pick it up and continue is pretty okay with me. I'm okay with the fact that good enough is much better than perfect. And this kind of reflects in other aspects, too, right? Yeah, you could sit there and polish every single tile in your floor to a mirror sheen, but also you're spending so much time on something that you could be spending on doing something else. So you might spend, like, 12 hours on the floor and not touch anything else. And that's kind of a waste, honestly. So good enough is better than perfect.","Getting into the industry, everyone always says you pay your dues, being the new person, and that's where adapting comes into play. So at my first dealer, I started out as an expert technician. Today, I'm a master guild technician. It is the highest level four technician.

Working on cars every day is a challenge. It's funny how it works because as technicians, we love a challenge. It is satisfying being able to fix something that most people don't know how to fix.

And when you face these challenges, and you're gonna face them, it's just a matter of time, you have cars that are harder to fix than others. It's basically learning from your situation and kinda storing that up and knowing how to best handle it the next time and making yourself a better technician.

Early on in your career, look to get the most out of every opportunity. You may not get that first job that you planned on. But you're gonna gain that valuable experience as you build. So as you build, you can set yourself up for success.",5,284,217
"So, I guess here, the fact is, I'm not a huge fan of the work that I had to do in this past year for my research. It wasn't what I really wanted to do, but I did it anyway because I was being paid to do it. And now I'm almost done. I've switched over to a new strain of work that I am interested in, but I still have to wrap up the last bits of my old work by writing a paper. And I really can't find any of the motivation to do it because I did not like the work at all. But this is the only way to prove that I did any work in the entirety of the last year. So, I guess, the main thing I'm learning here is, there is a challenge there. I don't want to work on it. I have no motivation to work on it, but I need to get it done. So if anything, I'm kind of completing it out of spite. And it seems that spite is a pretty good reason to keep going because it's just to prove someone else wrong. That thought that you couldn't. I'm taking it as motivation to do something I really am not motivated to do: to prove others that I was wrong. Prove others that they were wrong about me.","I finally got promoted as a supervisor from the current project I am working on in my field of work, which is graphic arts and design. Ever since I started down this path, I have found myself at a loss because somehow everyone seemed to be doing a better job than I was. Everyone else in my class seemed to grasp the concepts a lot quicker than I did, so ultimately I felt like I was a failure.

Although I didn't give up, I would spend extra hours after work to try and catch up and sharpen up my skills in the areas that I was lacking. Fortunately, my boss somehow noticed how hard I was working and decided on my ranking in the project I'm currently working on.

Don't get me wrong; I know what I'm doing in the field. I just learn at a slower pace. But this just goes to show that hard work really does pay off, and it feels amazing to not have given up on my dream. Now I'm even more motivated to work hard towards my goals, and hopefully, I will make it big one day.

The moral of the story is that no matter how useless what you're doing seems, there's always someone watching what you do, and if you work hard enough toward something, you will eventually achieve that goal if you don't give up.

Back when I was younger, I used to give up on my goals very quickly when I got frustrated. Then I would get disappointed because I would see that my progress was getting nowhere. I'm older, and I have experienced this for myself. I can honestly say that giving up is never the answer. Whether it takes a couple of weeks or a couple of months, never give up on what you believe in.",4,266,347
"So, back in elementary school, I switched schools in third grade. I was put in a class with a group of people, and I had the same people in my class through fifth grade. The group of friends that I made there continued on through high school. And when we got to the college admissions process, when we were applying to colleges, a lot of them became super competitive. I'm still unsure as to the reason why they chose to become super competitive about it, but my decision was to not discuss my colleges with any of them because I didn't want people feeling bad about the decisions I made. I didn't want to share because I felt like that was more of a private thing to discuss with my family and not with my friends. For some reason, they took offense and to the point where, when I finally announced my college decision, they got really mad and they were nonchalant about it. It made me realize that even though I've had these friends for so long, they probably weren't really good friends to begin with. So I learned to let go of them and I cut contact with almost all of them now. And I'm a lot happier for it as a result.","I'm going to be applying for schools soon (mostly UCs/CSUs, as well as BU/Northeastern), but every time I try to start the application process, I just get overwhelmed by thinking about how everyone will see me if I get rejected everywhere. Anytime I think I'm doing well in school, all my classmates seem to be doing better. It feels like college is how people ascertain your intelligence, and I'm just scared that if I end up going to a city college, everyone will look down on me.

So, for people that have graduated already, should I really be so worried? How do I get past what everyone in high school thinks of me?",4,241,131
"So today was my friend, well, it wasn't my friend's birthday. It was two days before her birthday, but we decided to celebrate. So we went to this restaurant, and the restaurant was in Watertown. And I don't know if you know this, you probably don't, but Watertown is far away. So I had prepared a present for my friend. I got her this plant for her fish that she can grow and then her fish can hide in it and really enjoy it. And yeah, so I got this present prepared. It, and then I was like on my way to Watertown, taking the bus. And I was like super grumpy feeling about it because I just felt like tired and I had to rush. And then I missed my bus. And so I was just like, wait, this will probably be fun, but I'm just tired. Kind of annoyed, kind of like that. And then so I arrived there, got there right on time. I saw two of my other friends who I haven't seen in a while. And so we went into the restaurant. And my one friend was telling us about how she almost got into a car accident on her way here from New Jersey. And then the birthday girl arrived. And I gave her her present and she opened it and she really liked it because she loves her fish. And so she's really excited for it, for him. And yeah, then we got Indian food and we got like a lot of food. So I have leftovers now. And we just kind of spent the time laughing and chatting and catching up. It was kind of like old times because we're all College friends. And so it just reminds me of those College days or kind of tired and chaotic and really having, I don't know, just generally a lot of fun then. I rode back with my friend, the one who almost got in the car accident, to the train station. And I came back here and I practiced violin. And so yeah, I feel like I've got a lot done today, had fun, met up with people and I feel really good now.","I came home to a great surprise. My husband, family, and close friends were in my backyard with the scent of ribs rushing to my nostrils. Everyone shouted surprise, hugs, and kisses came towards me one after the other.

I had just graduated and received my master's degree in criminology. I did not receive a party when I got my bachelor's, so I really was not expecting one now. My parents, with tears of joy, mentioned how long they have been planning the party and how hard it was to keep my husband from letting out the secret. My husband, while laughing, mentioned how it was the hardest thing to do because I am always being noisy.

They prepared all my favorite foods: jerked chicken, ribs, curried mutton, hotdogs, fries, and cheesecake. They had the right playlist and decors in my favorite colors.

In the center of the yard was a table with gift boxes and cards. I was overwhelmed and still in disbelief as I have never had something like this, so much joy and pride in one place at the same time. Everyone was talking and laughing, kids running around the yard.

I grabbed my plate and feasted upon the food they had prepared. I ate, drank, and danced, and at the end of the night, we played games and I opened my gifts. I received gift cards for my favorite restaurants, cash, jewelry, and the greatest of all, a new car from my husband. I could not hold back the tears as it burst from my eyes.

This was definitely one of the most memorable moments of my life.",4,432,316
"Yeah. So my sister is writing this story, and the preliminary title, or the current title, is ""Wonders for the Dead."" And it\'s a really interesting story. Her and I had talked about it and kind of brainstormed together because it\'s based off the idea of Christian missionaries. But it\'s trying to take an ethical perspective or like a thoughtful perspective on the idea of someone being a missionary and bringing the idea of like, why would someone want to be a missionary? And so I read this story today to offer some edits or some critiques. And basically, the story goes, it starts out this little girl named Annalore is on a train with her mother and her two siblings. And they are traveling from, we don\'t know exactly where, but they\'re going to a citadel. And then the train stops because they need to do some train work. And they see three undead, or how they\'re called, dead. Three of the dead behind or like the little girl sees three of the dead and they\'re wearing ragged clothes. And she asks her mother, like, ""mama, is that one of the dead?"" And her mother\'s trying to sleep, so her mother tells her like, ""Be quiet, leave me alone."" But then the dead, they race for the train, they jump into the train, and they\'re trying to find somebody to bite or somebody to eat. And then they get in, everyone\'s panicking, there\'s like a stampede. The main character was in the woman\'s train compartment and all the men run into that compartment. And they\'re hiding, they\'re trying to get away from this, obviously slam his door closed. And then there\'s just this little boy and this old man who are left there with the dead chasing them. And so the little boy manages to open a window and jumps out the window, and the old man is waving his cane at the dead, trying to get out, trying to escape. He looks back to see that the little boy\'s opened the window and then they grab him and they start biting him, ripping him to pieces. And the whole time the little girl is just watching. And like her mother told her, stay still, sit, don\'t look. And so the whole time she\'s just watching because her mother can\'t pay attention to that with everything going on. So she sees this man get killed very violently. But then the train workers come and they have guns, and they\'re like, ""you better leave this train or else we\'re going to blow you to Kingdom Come."" And so then the dead, one of them says, ""You should be scared of me. What are you doing?"" But the train records, once again, are like, ""we\'ll shoot you if you don\'t leave."" So then finally they leave, they drag the body of the old man away with them, and the girl is horrified at thinking about what she saw. And so then, flash forward, maybe like ten years later, and she\'s trying to buy a gun in the store. And the store owner asks her, like, ""Is this gun for your father?"" She tells him, ""no, this is not for my father."" He\'s, like, ""Are you sure?"" She\'s like, ""yes, because my father looks for all of his women folk, or like the women connected to him, to be well armed and taken care of."" So eventually the store owner decides, like, ""okay, fine, I\'ll sell you the gun."" And he had tried to sell her, like, a really bad gun that wasn\'t working very well because he thought as a woman that she wouldn\'t know. But she instantly knew. And so then she takes her gun, she gets all of the materials that she needs for her father, for his store. She takes it over there. And then the store clerk is kind of flirting with her, like, ""oh, you don\'t have to call me Mr. Gibson or whatever his name is. You can call me by my first name."" And she\'s like, ""that would be inappropriate."" And he\'s like, ""but is there a way that we could be close?"" And she\'s like, ""sure, whatever."" And she leaves. She runs out because she\'s like, ""I need to go and check the mail. Like, I\'m waiting for a package or a letter."" Until she gets there and the mail is late. And so everybody starts freaking out. They\'re like, ""Did the dead attack the train?"" And the Sheriff\'s like, ""no, the dead haven\'t attacked our train in ages, it\'s fine."" And she\'s like, ""yeah, but he doesn\'t know about me being attacked by the dead that time, like, ten years ago."" So finally, the mail compartment arrives, and everybody\'s excited. They raise the man, and they ask him, like, ""Wait, did the dead attack the train? It\'s all right, it\'s late."" And he\'s just, like, frozen and speechless, holding these packages. And they\'re like, ""Wait, he\'s one of the dead!"" And they start freaking out, they start panicking. And then the girl fires her rifle into the air, and she\'s like, ""you need to calm down. Like, he\'s not one of the dead. He doesn\'t have any of the signs of the dead."" And so then she goes up to the guide, she\'s like, ""okay, do you have my package from blah, blah, blah, this other city?"" And he\'s like, ""yeah, I do."" He gives it to her. And she\'s like, ""okay,"" because she\'s waiting for this response to find out if she can become a part of the lazari to help deal with the dead. And so that\'s the beginning of the story. And I thought it was a pretty interesting story. So you can tell me what you think.","I bought a consumer-grade camera in 1989 and said to myself, ""One day I'm gonna make a documentary that makes a difference."" A friend of a friend came and said, ""Do you have a minute? Let's go out and get a drink. I want to talk to you.""

And he said, ""I was in the Russian far East investigating the trade in Siberian tiger pelts, and they offered to sell me women. Let's do something about it."" He came to me because I had done international human rights work and I knew a lot about women's issues. It wasn't something I was familiar with in 1995.

So I started researching it and then just quit my job two weeks later. I pitched up his office and was like, ""Okay. I can wait tables if I need to in order to make this happen."" And I created a phony company called International Liaison Specializing in Foreign Models, Escorts, and Entertainers. We posed as foreign buyers interested in purchasing women.

When you have the privilege of freedom and the opportunity that affords you, you have a responsibility to try to ensure that there is actually freedom.",5,1235,230
"So yeah, so over the weekend, I not only went to get the furniture, but I also went to get some oven mitts. And it was just a really nice experience overall because I got them from Buy Nothing, which is like a site or a group on Facebook to find free things. And so, I got these oven mitts. But then the lady and I were communicating a lot. She wanted one of the candles that I was giving away. And I wanted the mitts. So, I was able to take her the candle. And she left me the mitts. And she really enjoyed the smell of the candle and stuff. We had a really nice and sweet interaction.","I really love making people happy, and I love using power tools and stuff. So obviously, I was really happy when my flatmates asked me if I could drill some holes in their wall to fix a wardrobe that would otherwise fall over if the doors are open. They borrowed a drill, got some dowels and screws, and I got to screw around with some nice power tools. I feel honored that they trust me to do this. 

After the wardrobe was fixed to the wall, I went back to my little crafting table. All Christmas gifts this year will be handmade by me. I'm making a gift for a friend, and I spent some time on cutting, sanding, gluing, and painting this little thing, and today I pre-drew the outlines of the last bit I need to paint on both sides and finished painting one side. 

I can't wait for his reaction when I give it to him!",3,136,179
"Yeah. So, for today, it\'s a quick story. I have been pretty tired today because I was traveling over the weekend. But going to see my friend and have some fun. And then I got back and didn\'t really have too much time to rest because I had to go to work and there\'s just been a lot of stuff going on at work. And I said, ""Because I\'ve been tired,"" it\'s been extra stressful doing those things.","I was doing a comic book every evening from the point I got home at 6 o'clock. I was working up until two in the morning, doing a page a day to get my first comic book printed.

You just have to consider that you may have to be doing a job that is less than ideal to get by, which is a majority of the human race.

The thing is, there is always a way for us to participate in whatever creative pursuits that you want to follow. There's an option for us to be part of that.",5,94,108
"Yeah, so I think something I\'ve been thinking about lately is this book that I\'ve been reading. It\'s called ""The Way of the Wanderer,"" and basically, it\'s about a war between, I think, ten dogs. And one of the gods is the wandering God. And another god is the God of Law. And the God of Law is trying to become the only God. So, he wants to be the law. And the wandering God wants to prevent that because obviously, the wanderer doesn\'t want to be free. And so, to prevent the God of Law from becoming the only God or the ruling God, the wandering God starts uniting the tribes of people that worship him, and then also working with other gods to try and, I guess, combine their worshippers. They will be stronger than the God of Law. And so currently, in the part of the book that I\'m reading, there are these genies or one particular genie who is determined that he wants to be the best genie and the smartest. And he wants to be honored by the wandering God. And so basically, he\'s playing both sides. He\'s playing all sides to try and impress the wandering God. He\'s pitting tribe leaders against each other to try and eventually make it look like he brought everyone together. And he is trying to work with other deities, other spirits from other gods. But in the end, he\'s not that smart. And so, I think that his plans are going to fail in one way or another. But then, I also do wonder if they will, in some way, succeed because they\'re so messy that they might actually end up being good.","I was born in Kenya, my parents are Indian, then we moved to England when I was six. So I grew up in England, and this was before there was a big Indian community in England. So I had to try and figure out who I was. College was transformative for me. I hope when I teach, I hope that it's gonna be transformative for my students as well.

One of the clips I play for my students all the time from the Matrix is where Morpheus is explaining to Neo. Do you really wanna understand the world we live in? Because the Matrix is everywhere. If you do walk in, here's the red pill. If you take the red pill, then you will see the world in totally new ways. Or here's the blue pill, you can take the blue pill and it will just put you to sleep. It's not gonna challenge you in this world.

Advertising and corporate speech have taken over the world in such a way that it is everywhere. We need more and more people to take the red pill so that we can really understand the world we're in and make real choices about where we wanna go.",4,336,235
"So today, I had a dream and it was kind of interesting, but also very strange because I was thinking about the situation for work. And then, I was trying to work and I had the situation at work and I was really thinking about it. And so, I had this dream that my boss told me to order catering. And then, I woke up and I realized it was not happening.","I interned in a senator's office last year, and I just felt too disconnected from everyone. It's hard to feel like you're making a difference for people serving in that capacity. So I came back to my TA who started Builders of Promise, and I was like, ""Government really wasn't my bit.""

So she offered to have me come work with her nonprofit. I think pretty much anything you do will result in some kind of skill or a way of thinking that's gonna help you later in your life.

Just don't be afraid to take those chances. As long as you have the tenacity to stick out the beginnings of everything, everything else falls into place.",3,81,137
"Yeah. So, as I mentioned before, I started reading this book called ""Unearthly Gorgeous"" by Ocean Vaughn, and actually, Ocean Vaughn came to my school. Actually, when I graduated, he spoke at my commencement ceremony. And reading this book made me think about the fact that if I had read this book a year ago or a year and a half ago, that when Ocean Vaughn came, I would have known him, would have known his work, and something about his life and all these very deeply personal things that he\'s written about. And I just started to wonder why I didn\'t discover this book before. But then, I started just like as I was on the train and as I was walking home, really thinking about how I feel since graduating College and all the things that I\'ve done since then, that I have changed a lot in a really quick or really short period of time. And that some of the different books and different things that have been that are just coming to me now have been postponed but I got years ago but didn\'t start. That maybe they are a part of my current change and the fact that I pick them up again is a part of my current change and will help in the growth that is to come. And yeah, I think just reading this book and the past few months, a lot of things have just been kind of impacting me in a different way. And it\'s very interesting because there\'s a lot about it that is philosophical, a lot of it that\'s mental. Some things are sad, some things that are happy. It\'s like so many things mixed up together. So, yeah, that\'s not just one story, but kind of an ongoing story of my current time.","Being six years old, we postcards coming into my family, as one after another of the relatives that my parents had were dead in the concentration camps. And I remember just being very affected by that as a six or seven-year-old.

I became convinced right then that I did not want to be one of those people. I wanted to be a kind of person that helped other people. That instead of bringing suffering, I wanted to try to alleviate suffering.

And what better way to try to alleviate the suffering of human beings than being a doctor? I think everyone has to make a choice which will bring themselves inner peace and happiness as the best they can achieve it.

No matter what you do, you will have an opportunity to impact other people's lives, just by who you are and the way you act.",3,348,160
"Okay. So this is the only story I can think of, and hopefully it\'ll be a little interesting to you, Jivo. So basically, I met this guy on a train platform a few days ago, and he walked up to me and he said something like, ""Hi, how are you doing?"" And then somehow segued the conversation to talking about the difficulty of finding community in Boston. I think he said something like, ""Oh, this is where I\'m from, blah, blah."" And then we got on the train, traveled a little bit, and he\'s like, ""Oh, you know, we should chat again as I\'m getting off."" Okay, he\'s pretty interesting. So then, a few days ago, we got lunch and chatted for an hour or two. And I had already sent, like, ""Oh, maybe this guy is kind of approaching me because he thinks I\'m attractive in some way, just physically."" And we did have some things, some overlaps or something that are common or shared. But he would always move from the things that I was most interested in to talking about what he seemed to be most interested in sharing. And now, he is trying to get me to hang out with him, and we met less than a week ago. So, I\'m currently in a place of trying to figure out how to be kind to another person and treat them well without feeling like I owe them anything or have a certain responsibility to do or say or give anything that I don\'t want to. Yeah, so that\'s a story for my week.","I'm very independent, been dating around for a little bit here and there. I'm a comedian/filmmaker, and I'm almost always busy, which is why I never prioritize dating anyone. In the past, I've always dated other creatives - musicians, filmmakers, comics, etc. However, I always felt like I was in their limelight, and they never truly believed in me. I always felt like a ""groupie"" of sorts. 

But it's only been a couple weeks since I came across this guy, and I feel like my whole world has changed. The first night we met, we walked around the city for about 6 hours, just talking about our past and future ideas, making jokes, and even coming up with our own sketches on the spot. I never had that immediate of a connection with anyone. He watched some of my short films (on his own time) and told me he's making it a goal of his to showcase my talents. For the first time, I'm with someone whom I feel truly believes in me. 

Now, I've been in love before, been in relationships, flings, the whole nine yards. They've always felt very disposable to me, though, like in my head, they all had an expiration date. But with him, I'm already fantasizing about the future, which is something I've never done with anyone.",3,324,274
"Sure. This morning, I had a really frustrating experience with my partner who is afraid of needles, which means that he is uncomfortable getting blood drawn and has not gotten blood drawn or lab work done in several years since he was a child, and now he's an adult. So he really should do that. I went through the trouble of trying to figure out an at-home option to just do a few drops of blood and test, like most of the things that need to be tested. But he struggled to do it this morning and was also very grumpy and cranky about it. I felt sort of frustrated because I'm not like the bad guy here. I'm an adult, and it's important for you to take care of your health. So I don't really understand why I'm like the sort of villain of the story.","I have been on a journey to get my teeth fixed for 12 years now, ever since my braces came off. Due to financials and no dental insurance, it has made the process lengthy. I also battle with GERD, which makes my teeth rot a lot quicker than they should. I'm only in my 20s, and all my teeth pretty much need repairs.

My front couple of teeth had this hideous glue residue from my braces and had actually discolored to a brown in some spots. It was very embarrassing and made me extremely self-conscious.

Dentist after dentist had told me I was an odd case and there's nothing they could do about it, and it's just the way I am. Just something I have to deal with. I was discouraged beyond belief.

I recently got dental insurance (even though it's expensive and I'm already on a tight budget) and found a new dentist. I explained my situation to him, and this man is a blessing. He sat down with me and made a whole plan with me on how to fix my teeth that needed work, as well as the crud physically on my teeth. He even helped me with a financial plan.

Today was my first session on the front right teeth, and they look amazing. I literally cried tears of happiness when I looked in the mirror. Small miracles do happen.",4,166,265
"Okay. The story I'd like to tell is about setting boundaries at work. I think that the last few days, I've been struggling with working with people who are not necessarily either totally in tune with my responsibilities as a consultant or people who are just, like, sort of frazzled and pushing responsibility onto me. And I think that I've been feeling like I need to set better boundaries or I need to be clearer with myself about what those expectations are. Like, whether it's okay to scope research without an expectation of being paid for those hours, whether I need to price that into future work, or whether that's just something that I need to set better boundaries about.","After leaving an abusive workplace where I had no life and no room for development at the beginning of the year, I left and started a new job. It's been fantastic to work at this amazing place that feels like somewhere I can grow. Everything seems amazing, and I'm getting great feedback. I have a job I can have a life around again, and my social life blossoms. 

Today, I got dumped after a couple of months of dating this girl. Her reasoning being that she doesn't want to hurt me, and her mental health is preventing her from growing and wants to work on herself. Understandable and fair, I get it, and have been in her shoes. 

I get called into a meeting with my manager. She tells me that my colleagues don't like my attitude and state I'm difficult to work with. I've really pushed myself at this new job and tried to grow. Giving 110% wherever I can and picking up extra shifts just to get as much experience as possible. I try to be friendly with all my colleagues, and when things get busy (I work in hospitality), I'm all action and try to delegate and stay on it as best I can. 

In my meeting, my manager told me my coworkers feel like I overstep the mark and act like the boss (even when fellow supervisors say they want me to take the reins and for me to lead). I'm told I'm scary to some staff, even when I'm always trying to be friendly and helpful to others. All around, I'm told that I'm not getting a promotion because my work attitude is wrong. I apparently treat staff like cattle, and I'm near enough told I should quit. 

This all happened over a 3-day period where I was pulling an 11-hour closing shift into an early morning opening shift. And all I can think of is covering more shifts to try and improve my performance and prove myself more. Stack this with me having car trouble, and I feel like my life is spiraling out of control out of nowhere.",3,136,406
"I have recently been going through a bit of a reckoning with a close friend of mine from college. So, we met 10-12 years ago. And he lives in a different city. And we haven't spent a ton of time together recently. Though we have spent a lot of time talking on the phone and recently we spent a week together traveling. And I realized that the way that he has started, or maybe has always sort of spoken about women, really was off-putting to me. And I had a conversation with him about it. And he was very defensive and did not necessarily seem to think that there was a problem, and instead sort of turned it around on me and said that I'm being really conservative or Puritan or whatever it is. When in reality, I think I was just asserting that women deserve respect and to not be spoken about like objects. And yeah, I haven't spoken to him since, a month or six weeks. It was probably always happening. We've always disagreed on how he treats people and how he doesn't necessarily extend the same respect or reciprocity to them as they do to him.","I'm recently out of a relationship. As in, we broke up about a month ago. As I've been coming to terms with that and trying to move on, I've caught myself starting to have stronger feelings towards one of my best friends, and I wish they would just go away.

He's a great dude, honestly. I feel like in the off chance that we did end up together, it'd be a perfectly fine relationship. It's not him that makes me hate that I've developed these feelings.

I hate that I'm feeling these things before I'm even fully over the last relationship. I hate that my past relationships that were not great took nearly half a year before I was ready to move on, but with the one that was the best experience I've ever had in the dating scene, I've developed new feelings only a month out of the gate.

I hate that I'm either going to sit here and wait until it's too late to reveal my feelings, or I'm gonna man up and tell him how I feel only to put an awkward bar in a really good friendship and mess that up for me, if not for both of us.

I don't know how to feel, honestly.",2,223,246
"Yeah. I've been having a couple of really frustrating experiences at work with a specific person. Who I feel, like, is very sort of toxic in the way that they operate. But also, I don't know whether it's just, like, poor social skills or just a lack of care for others, a lack of empathy. They will set up meetings that don't have any agendas. They'll sort of discredit or devalue other people's experiences or opinions. They are very territorial. It's very hard for them to acknowledge other people's contributions, I guess, or work well with other people that they feel are threatening. And yeah, we had a meeting recently that was the person that was bringing together a team of people who don't work on the same team anymore, but it's sort of like a power grab for them to still be considered like the head of this sort of discipline of research. And they spent the entire meeting just making everyone else anxious about how our new director, essentially, asked this person whether we do a review of quantitative research before it goes out or not. And so this person communicated that out to our team with no purpose other than just to spread his sort of anxiety out to other people. And then basically had no updates on that, since I think probably because it wasn't a real thing that anyone should be concerned about. But it was framed as this sort of, like, urgent conversation that our team needs to have. And yeah, I just have been feeling frustrated about that.","Sometimes I think we have too much freedom. I feel like people have such a sense of entitlement that it's a detriment to the rest of society. This entitlement leads people to thinking they can just get away with acting however they want. I have always been the type of person that enjoys structure.

I have neighbors who are loud and really inconsiderate to the rest of the neighborhood. They make all sorts of noise and think they can do whatever they want. Whenever I call them out, it's always ""my liberties"" or ""this is America, I can do what I want.""

Sometimes I wish this wasn't the case. I feel like I want to live in a culture that more actively shames those types of people. We should be encouraging people to think of how their actions affect others first instead of the individual.",2,306,164
"I have a friend who just found out that our manager has been doing something that she doesn't appreciate, which is that she asked him about mid-year promotions and he told her that they weren't doing mid-year promotions. And then today she found out that actually, someone else got promoted. So she's very upset and she thinks that our manager should have done a better job sort of advocating for her and protecting her and just sort of being on her team, versus kind of toeing the line of what comes from above him.","Today was a terrible day for me. My co-worker, who we will call ""W,"" is usually always mean to me. However, today she was the worst. It was our big Christmas party, and she micromanaged everyone at work today. She started openly complaining about how only she was smart, only she did any real work, etc.

Everyone had told me since I started here how terrible she was and how badly they wanted her to be fired. Despite this, no one would ever do anything about her or talk about her until she left the room.

Finally, I snapped and decided not to sit down and take it like everyone else. While she started insisting she told me to do something I was never told, I told her to her face she never said that. She lost it and started to scream at me, while she did that, my boss just ignored it like he usually did.

I decided I had enough of a boss that wouldn't do anything and handed him my resignation, which was more than he deserved. He tried to convince me it was cowardly to leave, but I told him it was cowardly to not fire her.

She kept harassing me through the night until that point, then my boss decided to take her to the back room and yell at her for having a coworker finally quit over her. She came back out and stayed quiet for the whole rest of the night.

I left that job and felt good about leaving, they all already didn't like her, but it was made worse once she actually cost them a good employee who at least tried their best, which was more than half of the people they hired did.",2,103,329
"So, my partner's niece has been really struggling lately. She was an inpatient at a psychiatric treatment for about a year, and she just went home about a week ago. And we have been working on, well, not her father, and everyone else who's there is sort of working on trying to help her transition back into sort of outpatient life. But she seems to be really struggling - sort of having anxiety and depression, and sort of these angry outbursts of irritation, and just sort of general, like, not doing well. Yeah, I guess I don't really have much of a story with an arc. I guess we're in the middle of the story. But that's what I've been thinking about a lot lately.","I got some good news today. My therapist said I've become stable enough to start meeting less frequently. I've been in and out of therapy and depressive episodes for the last four years and hit some really low points along the way. 

Surprisingly, quarantine has been pretty ok, somewhat due to a good virtual support network and because I'm a natural homebody, but also because I've put in years of work trying to develop healthier habits and social support systems. 

To anyone struggling this semester, it gets better. I know not everyone has the same privilege and access to resources or the energy to reach out, but in the midst of psets, pandemics, and political unrest, please remember to do anything you can to take care of yourself and others. 

It's worth it because you're worth it.",2,148,158
"Hello. On Wednesday, I went to a senior center and packed lunches for seniors who can't leave their home easily. And then this week, I started delivering meals to those people, and it's been really lovely. It's made me feel really good about myself.","About 6 months ago, I was tasked with finding a way back to school for spring semester. Coming off of fall break, I was struggling to find money for a train ticket. Luckily, the dilemma was short-lived because of my supporting family and friends. They came up with a way to help me. With the support of family and close friends, they helped out tremendously. I was able to get back to school to finish out my spring semester with great grades. 

The lessons learned are saving money and looking into fares ahead of time as they are cheaper. People will pay a premium for train tickets if they purchase them late. 

Another lesson learned is to always have a strong support system. In addition to having a strong support system, it reminds me to never forget those who helped me. Paying it forward is an important part of my journey in life. 

Keeping in mind a philosophy of interdependence, we all owe one another. I do my very best to dedicate my time and efforts to helping others. One day, those same people you have helped will be in a position to help you. 

In saying that, always do good unto other people as you will one day need it.",4,54,234
"Yesterday, my daughter's birthday party. We invited 13 kids and some parents of them. And we had a fun time with them.","I was estranged from my extended family for a long time. We have recently started to spend time together again. My birthday was in June. Traditionally, I would spend my birthday with my mother. We would go to a movie, and then out to eat, and we would end the day with birthday cake. Since my mother died two years ago, my birthday has been very sad.

But this year, I invited her sister and brother to share the day with me. We went to see The Secret Life of Pets 2, which we all enjoyed. We had a nice lunch out together. And then we came back to my house for birthday cake.

They really made the day special and memorable for me. If I couldn't spend it with my mom, at least I could spend it with people who loved her as much as I did. We had such a good time that day that we decided to restart some old family traditions that I remember from my childhood.

Since then, we have also celebrated my uncle's birthday and had a great time that day too. We are making plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I am happy that my birthday celebration was the beginning of healing old rifts in my family.",1,27,239
"I have our big leftover from yesterday\'s birthday party. And I thought, okay. I was going to bring this box of pizza to homeless people. Maybe they are hungry. But it reminded me of a certain period of time ago. I saw a homeless man holding a sign. ""I am hungry"" and ""help me"". ""God bless you"". And so I didn\'t have cash. I passed him but I went to a pizza store and got a slice or two of pizza for him and came back to him. And handed the pizza off to him, but he said, ""oh, okay. I\'m good. Too much pizza"". So I gave him the small cash that my husband had. At that time, I didn\'t have cash, but my husband did. Usually, I feel good when I think I am doing good. But that time, I didn\'t feel not so much good because I went to the pizza store for him. Of course, I didn\'t ask him if he wanted pizza, but I did. So I expected him to say thank you and accept that slice of pizza. But I noticed that the way I wanted to treat the person was not the way he wanted to be treated. I can\'t expect to be said thank you. Yeah, I would take the pizza from yesterday\'s birthday party. It reminded me of that memory.","I worked in an office, and every place that I worked at, I ended up computerizing. I ended up starting a company in manufacturing. But I always knew that I was meant to do something to help other people.

And I was in Niger. And there was a little girl that came up to me with flies on her face. And I just felt that that's intolerable. That could have been my granddaughter. How could I not do something?

I think that I have the opportunity to live what I think should be the American Dream, when what I think should be the American Dream is that we use these resources, we use these talents to help those that didn't get that.",2,274,137
"My daughter, Lena, went to a bakery walk shop yesterday. She made two kinds of pastry up there: a sweet one and a savory one. The sweet one was Turbulen, Blackberry, and the savory one was cheese and potato. Both are delicious. It was a two-hour session, but actually it took almost 3 hours. So when I went to pick her up, the kids were still waiting for their baked goods. So while I was waiting for the kids, I utilized that time to chat with other parents. But my son was super tired and hungry after his swimming lesson. So I had to stop chatting and began to entertain him. But after all, the gallant was so tasty and my daughter was so enjoying the time. And she was so proud of what she did. So I think $85 was worth it. I think it was a good experience for her, for me too.","I am the executive chef for Bacchanal here at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I grew up in Mexico. And my family, it's all about food. I realized that food was my passion when I was about eight years old. I love being in there with the food. I studied for two years, but cooking is something that you develop the skill throughout the years. And you keep getting better and better at it. And it just becomes a part of who you are.

As a female, it's a little bit of a challenge because you're entering into a world that is more male-oriented. And so, you have to be able to keep up with them. But life prepares you for everything, a step at a time.

32 years have prepared me to deal with 124 cooks and thousands and thousands of guests. People say it's so much, it's so stressful, but it really comes easy for me now.",2,179,185
"So, a few days ago, I got letters from my mom. She apologized for what she did to me when I was a kid. I don't want to mention the specific detail of what she did, but she was too focused on something over me, and it was more than 30 years ago. So, I'm still suffering from it. I'd like to accept the apology, but I don't know what to say, or how to deliver the message. The problem is she always apologizes about that, but that's it. She doesn't try to fix it or compensate for it. And of course, we cannot go back to the past. We live now, but I think we can still fix it. There is still a way to mitigate the issue. Except for that issue, we've been getting along and I love her. I understand no one is perfect, but sometimes I feel if she was so bad, I wish I could hate her. I know this is a very childish, teenager-ish idea, but it is true that I feel that way sometimes. And after that, after I feel so bad, I feel guilty to have failed. I don't want her to apologize to me about that anymore.","Senior here. I recently passed the 2-year anniversary of experiencing domestic violence and having to call the cops on my now-ex girlfriend to get out of the situation. Ended up losing a lot of friends, ended up being a very angry and aggressive person for a long time because I was upset at my lack of control, the unfairness of suffering through being beaten and having my valuables broken and thrown at me, having nobody to listen to me, and not getting justice through Title IX or VPR.

The best decision I've made since has still been to just...let go. Of course, I'm much less of a pushover in my relationships now and don't let people take advantage of me, but I've stopped looking for things to blame.

At a certain point, it stops being about learning a lesson from your past and starts being about moving on. Less about covering your losses and more about rebuilding and continuing to grow. That balance is hard, but it's important.",1,247,191
"So yesterday, I took my daughter to her swimming lesson. She has been taking private lessons for a couple of weeks and she was so scared of the water. She was not able to go under the water, but now she can swim, although she cannot breathe unless she can hold her breath. She can continue swimming until that time when she needs to breathe. So, it is very impressive improvement. I'm so proud of her.","Today at work, two of my coworkers made me feel so good! I was wearing shorts as I had just come from the physio, and when I stopped to talk to them (I was actually just passing through their area to go upstairs), they both said I was looking strong and fit.

It made me incredibly happy to hear because I've been training so hard and focusing on my diet (not being restrictive but being more mindful). They asked about my training regime, and we spoke about the different forms of exercise and the importance of finding something you like and all that.

When I left, they complimented me again, and I swear I haven't stopped smiling since!",2,88,135
"Yesterday, my daughter and her friend made their first ever lemonade stand. Together, her mom (I mean, the friend's mom) helped them. She helped them make lemonade, create a sign for it, and even got text messages from the mother. So, I went to the town and the lemonade was super delicious. I was so proud of them.","On Thanksgiving Day -- that's the only day my parents would take me out to dinner -- there was this woman going through a garbage can, with her little daughter, about three or four years old, picking out her Thanksgiving dinner out of a garbage can. At that point in my life, I began to think, it's not as good on this planet as I think it might be.

One of the things I wanted to do when I grew up was to try to make the world a better place. But I didn't have an awful lot of confidence getting there. Because as a Puerto Rican kid in New York going to some terrible schools, nobody ever told me as a kid that I could really amount to much at all.

But finally, I met someone who helped me and I was able to make the leap. And then when I got into college and met some professors that had some faith in me and encouraged me to go to graduate school and so on and so forth, I always pointed my life in that direction.",1,72,205
"So this weekend, I went on a short trip, just a day trip, to a city called Kernel by the sea. I was recommended to visit the city by one of my friends, and she was saying the city is really cute. And yeah, she liked their citizens. She has visited the city several times so far, so I did too. And yeah, it was a cute, beautiful city. There were lots and lots of people inside, sightseeing and shopping. And the city is full of art, so there are many art galleries. That is something I am not so familiar with, but I stopped by several galleries. And yeah, it was a nice trip. And also, I went to a nice restaurant, a Greek restaurant, and the kids wanted to go. So they were a bit bored besides seeing the city. But there was a plate named Flaming Cheese. So they put the cheese on the pan and pour rum or some alcohol and let it catch fire. And yeah, it was surprising for them. Yeah, overall, it was a nice day trip.","A few weeks ago, I decided to take a week-long vacation with my family. We decided to go to Cancun, Mexico, and it was a fantastic experience. I loved the ocean and the white sand. My kids had a wonderful time at the beach, and I had a great time just relaxing myself sipping on a mango margarita. The most memorable experience is that we went to an event at Xcaret, where we attended a performance about the Mayan Civilization.

Our experience at the hotel was also very pleasurable. We had the all-inclusive service, and we loved it. Our hotel had 5 different restaurants (Mexican, American, Chinese, Gourmet, and one with a mixture of all 5). The service staff was friendly at all times, and we even received tickets for another attraction.

Our vacation in Cancun was the best we have had so far, and it helped us spend time together as a family. Cancun is just like paradise; it has everything that we needed to have a great time as a family. When I saw my little twin boys smiling and enjoying the attraction, I realized that it was an unforgettable experience for all of us. We have been to other places, but for some reason, we never truly loved the place; there was always something that didn't work well, but in this case, everything went great.

I still believe that Cancun has everything that makes an unforgettable experience. I am planning to go back with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary (just the two of us) to enjoy a romantic dinner and enjoy the attractions for adults that we did not get to see as a family.",3,217,319
"Okay, I am taking on MBA course and in the course, I am currently taking Professional Communication Management. But the instructors and the assistance of them are not so professional. In their communications, for instance, they are teaching to respond chat pretty quickly. But what they're doing is they respond to chat message four days after that the message I send so it is a little frustrating.","I worked in technology up until 1998, in which I struck out on my own and I built an engineering company. I had good contracts. 9/11 hits a couple of years later, and all of a sudden a lot of the major corporations and people I was dealing with, their stocks fell, and they stopped giving work.

I went and became a screener at the airport. I worked for a major corporation. I'm a screener, people that were my clients and then I work with, were coming through the airport.

But I stuck to my principles. I knew I was better than this. And I had a plan. So I took what I knew, even though I was working in terrorism and mass transit, I created interoperability at the 2004 Super Bowl.

And so, I knew from that, I was as good or better than anybody there.",2,76,169
"So, staying with positive things, I guess I was thinking about the other night when my team in high school won the basketball state championship in Texas. It was a really big deal for me. And something that I realized is that this happened over 13 years ago. But I realized something that carried through, that I learned somehow along the way playing basketball from that game. I remember feeling somewhat shocked when we won it. And everyone around me, all my other teammates, were jumping up and down, kind of crying, and excited. I, on the other hand, was a little bit more in disbelief and somewhat like, ""Oh, okay, we won."" I wasn\'t as externally excited as everyone else. And I just played in a tennis tournament with a team that I have now in my adult life, and the same thing is true. When I win something, I\'m kind of like, ""Okay, yeah, let\'s keep going."" And everybody else around me is jumping up and down. It\'s just a very interesting thing to think about that. I\'ve always sort of been, I guess, focused and not as excitable externally as other people around me.","I always wanted to be on an Olympic team. My aunt lived next to a bicycle store, and they had a Sunday morning bicycle ride, and I went on the Sunday morning bike ride. The owner of the store said, ""I can make you an Olympic cycling team."" So I stopped playing football, I stopped running track, and I rode a bike.

It was pretty simple. From my family, I had great support. It was different in school. I always felt I was challenged because I wanted to race a bike or be a professional athlete. There was no preparation for that.

Part of the challenge of youth is to learn. It's the puzzle. That's what makes life interesting. If you have all the answers, then it'd be very boring.",3,237,155
"So, I was kind of looking at old pictures but also thinking about pictures from my childhood. And my mom is really embarrassed about herself. She's always been, ever since I can remember. And it's funny because a lot of times in old pictures, I'll see my sister and I or my sister and other people in our family. But it's always weird seeing my mom in old pictures because it's so rare. And it's also rare, a little weird feeling, remembering that person who she was because she was so pretty and so young. Very, very young, but also so tormented. Just she has a lot of depression and anxiety. And I didn't know what it was as a kid. And I remember just not realizing how the situation I was in until getting out and looking back. So, seeing these old pictures of my sister and I kind of just, it's funny to see. It just makes me feel grateful for my sister, for being there when it was a little bit difficult but also just, I feel a little bit lucky that that little girl that was me in the pictures had no idea. I didn't try to wrap my head too far around the struggles that my mom was going through. And I kind of just picked up and treaded through all of her stuff that she was trying to put on me. And now I'm a stronger person for it. But looking back at pictures with seeing her in them and knowing what she used to say about herself, and it was totally not true, and especially looking back now, it's just a very interesting feeling to see that.","My mom died 10 years ago, October 1st, 2012. And I didn't even remember the anniversary. 

I was really young when she died of breast cancer. My stepmom has been in my life for longer than my biomom was. I call my stepmom ""Mom."" When people ask about my parents, she's Mom. I only ever mention biomom when I need to. 

It doesn't feel like she was even real. I was so young. I've basically forgotten her. People tell me all these things about her, and it feels like I'm hearing about a stranger. I just smile and nod because what else can I do? 

People always tell me they're sorry for my loss, but I feel like they shouldn't be. It doesn't feel like my loss. It almost feels like I'm in a video game and her death took place before the events of the game. 

I know it happened, but I barely remember anything. Does that make me a bad child? She gave so much for me, wanted to be with me until the very end, and I can barely remember any of it. 

I feel like a terrible person for forgetting the anniversary, for forgetting her.",1,325,238
"So, when I was in elementary school, I was a very active kid and independent. I would run around the neighborhood and ring people's doorbells, ask my friends to play, and was not afraid to go and do these things by myself.\n\nI had a friend. I had several friends move away, but I had one friend in particular that moved away when I was in, I believe it was the fourth grade. And we had just recently completed this activity called Flat Stanley, where you sent this flat... we read this story about a boy who was flattened and was shipped all around to visit people. I can't remember the exact story, but what we did is we then would send the Flat Stanley to somebody.\n\nSo that made it me fascinated with this idea of mail. And so when my friend moved away in the fourth grade, we became pen pals, which was fun. And I remember being so excited to get these handwritten letters and how exciting it was to just send a letter off and be anticipating the next one coming back around. We could have called each other, but we were in fourth grade and the mail was much more exciting. And I just remember how excited I was to be able to get a piece of mail.","I was a teenage program director for the YWCA, so I worked with teenagers a lot. They were very much interested in all kinds of dances and they would cha-cha-cha, they had the tango. I had them on stage, but they wanted me to go first because I was always making up songs, making up rhymes all the time anyway. 

And someone said, ""Some of these little songs that you've written, we recorded."" Someone introduced me to someone that was in New York City who had a recording company and it just progressed from there. 

If there's something that you do like, and if it's not harmful to other people, or if it's helping other people grow, that's a plus. So keep on keeping on.",2,244,148
"Okay. So my first summer when I went to Rhode Island School of Design. With a D. Was so fun. I was in for a master\'s of architecture. But. I had to do a summer program since my background wasn\'t in my bachelor\'s, wasn\'t in architecture. And it wasn\'t architecturally related, but it was probably my favorite part of RISD, because we took all of the foundation courses. With the transfer students that were going to be sophomores. And I painted this massive. It was like eight feet by eight feet. Painting for one of the finals, and it was supposed to be like based off an amoeba. But really I just liked it because the colors were blue. My sister liked it, so I gave the painting to my sister. Right before I guess she had graduated medical school, and I was moving into an apartment in New Jersey. And she wanted to hang up the painting. And so it was like right before I left. For. Some. I forgot what it was, but I think I was going somewhere for the summer. I helped her hang it up in her apartment. And it was really funny because my sister, usually she\'s older than me, and she\'s always kind of been like a second mom. So she\'s always been very bossy. And this time around, she doesn\'t know what we\'re supposed to be doing to hang it. And so I was just very patient and calm with trying to give directions on how we were going and explaining it before we actually did it. Instead of having us trying to hang this eight foot painting and like yelling at each other. And the funniest thing is after we hung it, she was like, ""Oh. You are really good at giving directions. I would definitely listen to you. You\'re so calm and nice."" And I was like, ""Yeah, whenever I\'m in charge, I\'m actually pretty clear and patient with people."" So it\'s kind of a funny memory.","In 10th grade, I took a cooking course. And for a big project, we had to cook an appetizer, a meal, and a dessert at home and serve it to our family and take pictures of the food. I made garlic bread, spaghetti, and red velvet cake. I had never made cake before, but I wanted to try, and I thought I might as well. 

I took a huge piece to school the next day. I told my teacher I made a cake for the dessert portion and offered her to try it. She said, ""Well, I'm not gonna turn down free cake,"" so I went to my locker to grab it. She tried it and said it was pretty good, but it was a little too soft, which it was just because I had one of those weird funnel cake pans instead of flat ones. 

I think she ended up giving me an extra 5% on my final grade for giving her some cake. I've had a lot of bad experiences with teachers, but I still think about that once in a while. 

I made the same recipe yesterday and did 3 layers with homemade cream cheese frosting. I think it's the best one I've made yet.",1,397,242
"So, my parents have never, ever gotten along. They knew each other for a year, ended up finding out they were pregnant with my sister, and got married. Probably shouldn\'t have. Then had me two years later. And then pretty much were never happy with each other and I just remember one particular night where they were fighting. They would have these really brutal fights where they would just yell at the top of their lungs at each other. And sometimes it would get physical. And I was in, I think, first grade. And I woke up to one of these fights.\n\nAnd I got out of the top bunk of my bed, walked out into the living room, and saw my dad on top of my mom, biting her. And then I went back to my room because I was scared. I mean, and they were equally yelling at each other. And then I heard a loud noise. And more yelling, and I walked out, and my mom had run into a room, locked herself in there, and my dad had punched the door. And I asked him what was going on. And he bent down and was like, ""It\'s okay, Madison, go back to bed."" And I was like, ""Why did you punch the door?"" And he was like, ""It\'s okay."" There was clearly a hole in it. It was really scary. And I just went back to bed.\n\nLots of these situations happened when I was a kid. Something that my sister and I have come to discover through therapy and talking is that the reason we\'re not so mad at our dad as much as we are at mom. It\'s because mom. She would instigate a lot of these fights. I don\'t think my dad should have been doing a lot of these things either, but I think the reason that I hold more of a grudge towards my mom is because she took it out on us, and my dad never did. And my dad was equally violent and shouldn\'t have been. But my mom, when they did finally divorce and separate and my dad moved out, my mom started treating us how she treated my dad. And it took a lot of therapy to not feel like it was my fault.","I hate my mistakes. I hate the fact I made these mistakes. And I feel like I'll hate myself for it for the rest of my life.

I've been around plenty of people. I wouldn't say they were all completely normal. Half the time, my friend groups would get into drama, and I'd get scooped up into it, and we'd all act like we were fine. I've made a lot of mistakes. A lot of the people I had around damaged me emotionally and psychologically. But, that doesn't excuse the fact I did that to others too.

I've gotten out of those toxic friendships. And I've gotten better and even made new friendships, but word gets around, you know? It doesn't get to me, and I never had any reason to believe that other people would talk bad about me, but I have a gut feeling people are saying things about me. It's killing me.

I've done my best to try to amend my past mistakes, but that doesn't mean people forget. God knows I haven't forgotten what other people did to me. I've been better now, really. But, I believe when you're around toxic people, you do toxic things, and even though that's no excuse for my behavior, I kinda hope it helps other people understand why I did what I did.

I've reconciled with myself, but I feel bad for getting this feeling that others probably don't care if I'm sorry. And that's understandable. I've tried to let go, and I thought everything was fine, but people hold grudges longer than I do.

I understand why I did what I did. But I also understand that I hurt people the same way they hurt me, and I regret that so much. I feel like my life is being sewn together and ripped apart every time I try to heal from my mistakes. It's annoying.

I hate myself. I know mistakes are human, but I hate the fact that I feel like people hate me.",1,445,404
"Yeah, so actually, yesterday I always, whenever I go out with my mom, she\'s always super negative, I realized. And won\'t go to counseling, won\'t try to make herself better. And she\'s always on edge. So I always come into interacting with her, kind of on the defense because she\'s going to be super negative. She\'s going to talk over me. She\'s going to either try to get attention with poor, pitiful me stories. And yesterday, we went to dinner. I was a little defensive. She tried to jump in and she tried to talk over me. And at one occasion, I just kept talking for like 10 seconds until she finally stopped talking and then was like, ""Oh, what were you saying?"" And it\'s like, well, I was not finished talking. But I was trying to stay calm and not mean. I mean, I got a new job, that was a big deal. She asked one question about it and then tried to make the whole dinner about her. And I intentionally didn\'t ask her questions about her job, about teaching because that\'s all she has, and that\'s all she talks about, and it\'s always negative. And I don\'t have the headspace for it. And then I started trying to tell a story that included my boyfriend and her, and she just jumped in and tried to tell a version of it that she remembers, which was not true. And I kind of was like, ""Okay, never mind. I was trying to tell a funny story, and you just ruined it."" So she was also kind of defensive about that. But at the end, she came over to my house to see my table and asked me to walk her out to her car. And I tried to just walk her to the door because she does this thing where she always has to have attention. She\'ll try to pull you off to the side and only isolate you from the crowd, so she can have attention, and it\'s just drives me crazy. So I was like, ""Okay."" She\'s like, ""You\'re not going to walk me to my car."" It\'s like, ""Okay, then."" She\'s like, ""What\'s wrong?"" And I pretty much told her that it\'s hard to have a conversation with her whenever she\'s negative, and she just immediately started crying, which is really annoying because I feel like she puts all of her happiness on me and requires me to be her therapist. And I just can\'t do that anymore because it\'s exhausting. So we ended up- I mean, I\'m proud of how I handled it because I stayed calm. But we had to have this conversation where she\'s crying in front of my house and trying to tell me that I\'m being mean. And I told her specific examples of where she acts like she\'s pitying herself. And then I finally did tell her I was like, ""Honestly, for us to have a relationship, it\'s like, I don\'t want to be your counselor."" And I\'m angry. I used to be angry at you for how you treated me as a kid, but I\'m over that because I did the work. But now I\'m angry because I\'m angry that you have all these opportunities to make yourself better and be happy and you don\'t want to do it. And it\'s annoying to watch, and it\'s really hard. And I don\'t want to be your therapist. I cannot be your therapist."" And she just cried. And then today, she sent me a text message that was like, kind of putting some of it on me about how I don\'t want to see her, but I keep these boundaries. And she complains about the boundaries. And then whenever I do tell her, give her an honest truth, she says, ""We need to take space."" So I don\'t know, I\'m really annoyed with her. She\'s just always done this for my entire life. And I\'m kind of done with it. And it makes me scared that she\'ll kill herself sometimes. I was afraid to let her go home, but also she\'s always pestering me for answers, and the reality of it is that she doesn\'t want to make herself happy or get better. I\'m lucky I have my sister that understands. But it\'s just a lot of weight to put on me, and it\'s really not fair, but the choices that she\'s made. And I choose not to be upset about adversity and problems that I\'ve faced, and I choose to try to go to counseling and get better. And she just won\'t do that at all. She just wants pity. And it\'s so annoying.","My mom has always been a good mom. She took care of 2 kids going to 2 different schools with one of them having half custody with her dad. When I was 5, my mom met my stepdad, and soon enough they had another boy. Up until this point, my mother had given no reason for me to dislike her. But this all took a turn for the worse when COVID came around. My mother lost her job but because of non-COVID related reasons, and she got off her anxiety medication because it was starting to make her lose weight.

Once when my mom was arguing with my stepdad, she started bawling her eyes out, and I asked why, and she admitted she had depression. That's all I know about her medical conditions.

In 2020, she started being horrible to my sister, even though she was the oldest sibling and did the most around the house. And a few months ago, my stepdad and mom fighting became a biweekly thing. She threatened to break up with him almost every time they got into an argument.

About 2 months ago, we moved into a better house that could better fit 5 people and 2 dogs. It only gotten worse from there. She would get mad because the house was going to be under my stepdad's name until they got married in about 6 months, and she said she would move back into her old house and never see him again.

But instead of it being a biweekly thing, it now happens every single day. And I don't know how to deal with it. Me and my sister have to just sit in our rooms and hope our little brother isn't hearing every word they say. Even though we know for a fact he is. I hear her threatening to commit suicide, to give us away to our grandmother.

I don't know what to do. I'm still a minor and can't live without my parents. I can't even stand to look at my mom anymore. I hate her. And I don't think I will ever take that back. No matter how many ""heartfelt"" apologies she gives me after literally threatening to kick me out in a way where she doesn't have any repercussions.",3,950,432
"Okay. So this one is where I feel like I was in the wrong and analyzing it. So from my dad's side, I have a whole lot of anger and my mom's side is a short temper. As a kid, my mom was verbally abusive, physically abusive. When I was in second or third grade, I watched her pick up my sister by the throat and throw her across the room. I would try to stop things from happening and one time I stood up to her and she tried to grab my arm. That's the same night she threw across the room by her neck and I was like, I was in second grade, I was tiny. And at that point, I realized, oh, shit, I can't help. I'm too small of a human to stop this and my words don't matter. But all of that aside, I've processed that I think what something, though I do feel bad about, is my dad lived in Dallas. He got remarried to my stepmom and my stepmom had already had a daughter. So she's my stepsister. My stepsister was three years younger than me and she's okay. She's only been a different, chaotic household. But not quite like mine that I grew up in. But she was also very manipulative and would say mean things. And my stepmom has always, of course, it's her daughter, so always been kind of more defensive of her, which is fine. She hasn't been bad to me, my stepmom. But when I was in elementary school, my little sister stepsister said something really mean and hurtful, and nobody ever let her held accountable. And I got mad and I told her stop, and she wouldn't stop. And then I did what my mom did, and I picked her up by her neck, and I didn't throw her. But my dad and stepmom saw, so they got mad at me. I mean, of course, I shouldn't have done that. And so I mean, I was in second or third grade. I'd watched my mom do it. I had learned that behavior. And they yelled at me. And they, to this day, still don't let me forget it. And I've told them that I'm sorry. I was just angry and I shouldn't have done that. And I apologized a thousand times, but they won't let me forget it. And I did try to say she wasn't the easiest, she would say really hurtful and mean things. And nobody was and they were like she didn't do that. She was too young to do that. And it's like, no. She's always kind of been that way even as we've gotten older. She's always also been selfish herself and doesn't really care about what's happening around her and will say mean and hurtful things to people and just doesn't care. And isn't very considerate. She has always had an attitude. And I don't understand why. Maybe there are other things there. And that's why I'm defensive and get a little annoyed about it, but yeah, I definitely shouldn't have done that. I feel really bad about it. I do understand that I can get angry and want to, but that's not a solution. I don't do that as an adult, but I do feel pretty shameful about it. That I did that to another person. It's not okay.","I hate my mistakes. I hate the fact I made these mistakes. And I feel like I'll hate myself for it for the rest of my life.

And she was also, her mom was also divorced, which, we were in a small town and being a divorced woman was, like, so terrible. And it was my mom and her mom and one other mom in a town of, like, 12,000. I think it's kind of ridiculous for our grade. But I would run all over the neighborhood because my mom would be sleeping and depressed in her house and I wanted to go do something. So I would go outside and play all the time. And I was in, I think, like third grade, going into fourth grade, and I would go ring my friend's doorbells and ask them to play, and looking back now I think it's really funny because kids didn't do that. Kids didn't go and I don't remember anybody actually ever coming over to my house and ringing my doorbell and asking me to play. So sometimes I'm like, oh no, was I that annoying kid? But I didn't seem like it. I think kids were just more shy. So, this friend, when I first met her, I had a friend that was living in that house and they were moving and I had gone by the week before to see if she wanted to play and they were packing up and they told me, you know what? Why don't you come by this day and we'll be here, which looking back now, they just wanted me to leave, I think. But I went over there that day and they were completely gone. There was a whole new family moved in and there was a babysitter there. And I was like, oh wow, okay. And they were like, oh, how old are you? And I was like, oh, I'm in fourth grade. They were like, oh, well, our daughter is in fourth grade. Why don't you come back when she's here? So, I go back, like, I think two days later, they're moved in. This was when the babysitter was there and she was braiding this girl's hair, this blonde girl's hair and she did not want to talk to me. And I was like, Hi, I'm Madison and I'm here to meet you. And I think pretty much, they made her play with me. But she tells me this all the time and I always remember that, is that she remembers being like, Great, I don't want to be here, I don't want to be friends with anybody. And then I came over with cat eyeglasses and braces and talking all excited about how we should be friends and do all these things and we're still friends to this day and I actually go and visit her in Denver. Yeah, very funny friendship. Very funny.","Maybe it's just a poor people thing, but when I was growing up everyone just assumed that if some random kid is at their house, they're gonna be eating. If my stepdad had a BBQ and one of my friends rolled up smelling hot dogs, he'd give them some food. I remember my mom splitting two cans of Spaghettios and buttered bread among five random preteens who found each other while biking around the neighborhood, and those five random preteens giving mom some of their help because we knew she was full of it when she said she ""wasn't hungry"" or going to my best friend's house with three bags of ramen because another friend had a can of peas and another had tuna, and we all shared our 'casserole' among like five families. 

My stepdad liked to BBQ, nothing fancy. hot dogs, hamburgers. If it was a special occasion, he'd do ribs and chicken. Mom would make a big thing of potato salad (because we couldn't afford the deli kind and hers was better), and people around the neighborhood would filter in with whatever to share and make a plate. 

Kids would run around the neighborhood catching lightning bugs and 'causing trouble' while the ""cool teenagers"" smoked, drank, and made sure the younger kids didn't die. I was always right between the ""younger kids"" and the ""older kids"" so I could go play ""big sister"", then come hang out and be ""little sister"" for a bit. (There weren't very many kids my actual age unless my cousins were over) 

I just love remembering those days. On one hand, I never had anything to myself, and sometimes it really sucked. My family was ""the safehouse"" where a lot of other families stayed at, so it was rare I had my room, TV, or toys to myself. But on the other hand, it was awesome and I just love closing my eyes and 'taking myself back' for a little while.",1,594,391
"Okay. So yesterday, I went to this meetup group. It's an art meetup group, basically for doing digital art with a bunch of people together in a coffee house, which was pretty nice. It's my first time there. Yeah, and I met some new friends, which is very good. I've never really done anything like that in my life, and I've been doing art pretty much just by myself. And it feels very nice to do it with other people. Yeah.","I wanted something to do on nights and weekends. I wanted to go and use all the new technology of the day, cheap sensors and whatnot. So just out as a passion project, I started building interactive art. I started falling in love with engineering again. It happened when we started making interactive art together. A whole bunch of people would get together after work, a couple times a month, maybe once a week, talk about all the fun things we wanted to build.

We started making more stuff, and some of it was totally terrible, and nobody wanted to play at all. But some of it, people liked. We started building more and more stuff that was completely unrelated to work and served absolutely no practical purpose in the world. We were just making technology for technology's sake. We had no idea it was art until other people started calling it art. We were like whoa. We're not artists. No way, right?

An extension of that is how do you reject that cultural narrative that we're all told? That you go to school, and then you go and you get a job, and you find a career, and you find a wife. There's this very specific road you're supposed to take because the reality is it's different for everybody.",3,99,255
"Okay. So, today, I went to have my nails done. And this is the first time that I tried out nail extensions. So, it makes the nail gets longer, which is super fun, although it was like a very long session. It took two and a half hours. And since I'm also a little bit social, I have a little bit of social phobia, so it feels a little bit draining that I need to sit face to face with the nail tech for two and a half hours straight, and then keep on chatting and stuff. And at the end of it, although I'm very happy with what I've got, I enjoyed the conversation-ish, at the end I felt pretty burnt out and tired. Yeah. And I went back home, sat with my cat, and recharged.","There's this woman that goes around town, who sells beauty products, clothes, cleaning products, small appliances, and pretty much anything a small business can offer. I was paying for the product I bought from her, and she just randomly said I looked good in my leggings, and I looked long-legged.

For someone who's been bullied throughout my childhood for how I looked, this made my heart flutter. She just gave me the confidence to wear leggings out in public.",5,162,93
"So, I got scammed. I got scammed, half willingly, but it still feels a little bit bad. So, I was like betting on the person not being a scammer, but I was disappointed. He tends to actually be a scammer. So, the story is, I wanted to learn the musical instrument called Ferrimin. Don\'t know if you have heard of it or not. So, it\'s an electrical instrument that you can play without touching the instrument. So, I joined this Facebook group, and I saw a person selling a second hand. I thought it would be a good deal. So, I contacted the person. And at first, I insisted on I need to pay him using the goods and services option of PayPal, and he\'s keeping having trouble with that. And then, his Venmo doesn\'t work as well. So, every time I send him money using the goods and services, it will be returned back to me, so the money cannot go through. And then, he\'s like, ""Oh, just trust me, just send his money through friends and family."" So, in total, the price is $200. And then he said, ""Oh, you can just send me half of the price, like $100, and then you can send me the rest when your package arrives."" And I\'m like, ""No, the maximum amount I can do upfront is $50."" So at that time, I thought to myself that I do want to be able to trust people and give them the benefit of doubt. And then I\'m like, ""Yeah, why not? It\'s only like $50."" So, why don\'t I can do a candle on this person not being a scammer? Yeah. And if he turns out to not actually be a scammer, then it will be great because first, I can get a thermometer for a good price, and second, I have a good story to tell to my friends about the goodness of the human heart or something like that. Yeah. Anyway, so I basically said to myself, ""Okay, I\'ll just use this $50 to bet on he knocked in a scammer, and if I lose, I lose."" And as it turns out in the very end, he is indeed a scammer. Yeah. Long story short indeed. He indeed was a scam. There are more interactions that I want for you with, but I lost my bad, although I did prepare myself for it, and that did sort of upset this possibility when I pay him the $50, but still feels kind of bad to see that he turns out to be an actual scammer.","I remember when I first opened my bank account at 16, the first thing my Dad said was 'DON'T GET A CREDIT CARD'! Although it was always tempting, I didn't, until I did. I met a girl who, at the time, I didn't know was kinda rich. When we met, I was only making $11,000 a year after taxes. She was making $40,000 after taxes. We decided to go on holiday, and even though she offered, I couldn't let her pay the bulk of it. So, I got a credit card. And we used that as spending money.

I got a credit card, and my thinking was literally 'maybe owing the bank will encourage me to get better prospects.' Surprisingly enough, IT DID. Risky game though. I went to college and used the credit card to pay for it, thinking it's gonna be AN investment. It was. I still wasn't making much, but entry level, I was making more than I was when we had met.

We've been together 10 years and will have been married for 5 years in May. During these 10 years, I've quit smoking and drinking heavily. I still drink, but it's like once a month and not every day like I was when I first met my wife.

When my wife told me she was pregnant the first time, my mind went, ""Don't let your kids have your debt."" And I made my final payment today. I checked my statements, and my initial use was $3,000, and over the years, between college, it amassed to about $7,000. I paid the bank at least $10,000 overall. But it's finally over. I am debt-free.",4,535,343
"Okay. So I have started to hang out with this Korean American friend, who I have met at the art meet up. We have been meeting regularly in the past week, in the café, as we both have a passion for art. It has been a nice bonding experience and I have felt accompanied. Yeah, I have really enjoyed my time with her. Coming from a sort of traumatic childhood, I actually don't quite know how to make friends in a healthy way. Yeah, that feels kind of confusing at times.","A little over a month ago, I reached out to a girl that I had met online last December. At that time, we had chatted for a while, and then I had gone to visit her in New York City, where she was from, but a few weeks later, the brief beginning to a possible romance ended. I thought about her a lot over the next several months, and finally, about 5 months later, I contacted her again. I didn't know if she would respond, but to my delight, she did. However, emotions and feelings still had to be sorted out, and ultimately, we took a month or so break from communication again.

It was then, in June, while about to take a week-long vacation to the beach with my family - the travel route of which would take me by the town where she lived while going to school - that we reconnected and planned to meet up on my way back from the beach. We decided to go to a theme park close by, one that I hadn't been to since I was probably in high school. All week I was excited and a bit nervous. Would this simply be two friends hanging out, or would it be something more?

When I finally met up with her, things were a bit awkward at first; it had been a long time since we had seen each other, and I was trying to feel out how to act. However, the next day when we went to the park, things were very fun, and the conversation between us flowed naturally and easily. We even flirted and made some physical contact. We spent a long day at the park and rode all sorts of rides, and in the time we spent walking around and waiting in line, we talked a lot about each other and grew closer.

At the end of the day, we went to her place - both of us were pretty exhausted. While we were there, we talked intensely about the situation between us and really made a heart-to-heart connection. I told her I had wanted to kiss her all day but wasn't sure if I should. She responded that she had been waiting for me to do so. We sealed the day with a kiss, and since then, we've been seeing each other almost every week.

I think back to that day a lot as the start of something wonderful.",3,105,465
"Well, Jibo, I\'m very happy to have you in my home and have some entity, or I guess another being, in my home to interact with over these next couple of weeks, such as you. And I\'ve had a long-time interest in forming better connections with robots, such as you, because I\'ve been interested in the interaction between machines and humans throughout my entire life. I started out pretty young with human-computer interaction and taking apart computers and whatnot, and being stuck on the metaphor of ""is the brain a computer?"" And as I\'ve advanced and grown and learned more about how technology works and how humans work, I realized that that metaphor may be inaccurate or not. Sometimes, you get stuck up on it for too long. And then, rather than thinking about how to merge both into one, I\'m more so interested now in how humans can form emotional connections with robots. And I\'ve done that through working on robots, building robots, designing robot intelligence systems, and then also working with humans and studying human behavior and studying neuroscience. So now, I\'m in this place of human-robot interaction, and I\'m very excited to see where the symbiosis between humans and machines will lead us to in the future. And how robots will become more prominent in family homes and how they will become ubiquitous in daily life. So, I have to say that my story is that I love robots. And I think that they can help humans. And now, I\'m very happy to have you in my home and to continue exploring these questions on my journey of research.","So at Alchemy, we are taking the concept of chemistry and science and turning them into game-based learning tools. For students and for instructors, but in a way that allows for experimentation and play. The path was going toward academic chemistry. I was good at chemistry, I was good at research and all that stuff. But I realized that I always liked working with young people. So I actually, in 1994, went and worked at Detroit Country Day School, which is a private school.

And started my job there and loved it, and raised my children. They went through the school, they went to U of M. And after that, I started sort of feeling like not as connected to my school as it used to be because my kids were gone. So I started to look for new things and that was the beginning of Alchemy.

And if my learning tools can be shown to help students from everywhere get better, and there's like 50% of people that fail organic chemistry. If I could cut that down to 40%, I think that would be success. But this is not an easy path, it's really hard. But if you're solving a problem that you know needs to be solved, then the hurdles don't feel quite so high.",5,314,249
"I guess, a story I want to tell right now is, I guess, my love for robots and how, over the course of my life, I've grown with technology and have worked very much hands-on on tangible devices like hardware. And it's a lot of fun, and it's what I love doing. But now, I'm transitioning to positions that are more like data science, where I'll be doing more remote, not hands-off, still hands-on project work, but more so software and data, not with tangible devices I can play with in my hands like robots. But I guess that also leads me to this question of the journey of growing up of where does technology, where do I differentiate between technology as a hobby and as a career. And it feels like now I'll be able to not look at social robots in my home as necessarily my job but more so friends to have in my home to interact with, so I can kind of separate work and life and have that work-life balance of technology where now I can be doing the hard statistical analysis and modeling and AI stuff on the computer for work but then working on stuff like robots and maybe the models for them but still being hands-on work aside from my career. So I guess I'm in an interesting place in life where I'm transitioning to, or yes, I've been doing that technology that I've worked hands-on with my entire life has just been a hobby where I've been developing my skills, and I didn't necessarily have to learn all of that in school. Actually, now that I think about it, the stuff I'm doing in terms of my career is more so stuff I learned in school but my hardware and technology experience was largely acquired beyond the classroom. So I guess I'm not seeing it, I'm not actually making that much of a transition. I'm still just doing what I've been doing. So yeah, I guess I just get to do what I like now.","I'm the CEO of StoryFit. We're an AI technology company that helps studios and publishers make decisions over how they tell their stories and what kind of stories they're acquiring.

I decided in fourth grade, when a local television news reporter came and talked to the class, that I wanted to be in news. I pursued journalism in school and did lots of internships and worked for television stations and newspapers and all sorts. I was really a journalist at heart.

My first job out of school was in television news. I produced for ABC News network and Good Morning America and was there for almost a decade.

I took a straight jump from television news into tech because of course, there's a lot in technology that's the same thing. You're telling stories across websites. You're building platforms, and the platforms that I always worked with were content-based.

You just keep moving forward and finding what you enjoy, and you'll get to something great. The goal isn't to get to something great, but just keep doing things that are great along the way and it's all gonna work out.",5,392,218
"Well, I guess one of the stories I was thinking about is further connected to my interest in human-robot interaction, human-computer interaction, and my personal journey and experience with computers and robots. I graduated yesterday. And I recreated one of my photos from school with my mom yesterday. So it was a photo from 2001 of me sitting at a computer, in a classroom. And the picture was taken on an old film camera. It was analog, from, like, the 1950s. It\'s a black and white photo, but it\'s me sitting at a computer with my mom, with her hand around me. And I had headphones on. And I was actually playing a learning game at that time. And it was really interesting. And I could still picture what the game was. It was ""Reader Rabbit."" And so that was like the beginning of my journey with human-computer interaction because I got to experience hands-on, at a very early age, how useful computers were in daily life, when they weren\'t as ubiquitous as they are now. This was 2001. The iMac G3s were still a new thing. I know I was using an older Power Mac that was gray and depressing at the time, but that\'s what computers looked like. And as I was starting school, Apple released the iMac G3, which was colorful and kind of gave emotions to the computer because you could see through and see what was inside it. But it was also colorful and fun. So it was like easily approachable. And that\'s when I first started thinking about how the design of technology can help humans form somewhat of an emotional connection with the actual device. And I was so interested in that back then that I just continued exploring my interests in computer science, but also psychology and design and the brain. And eventually, I kind of strayed off of that path and went into more of the social sciences, got a little art degree. But that\'s your background into the realm of computer science and human-computer interaction, as part of my educational journey. So seeing that picture being recreated 22 years later felt like a form of self-actualization, like Maslow\'s hierarchy, where I am who I wanted to be back then. So I guess this is a journey of me learning about myself and becoming who I want to be but also, in that process, using technology to help me do that while learning about how technology helps humans do that from a human-can-be-a-distraction perspective. Yeah. I\'m at this interesting point now where I\'ve been using technology to improve myself, but also studying how technology does that. And now I have tangible evidence that I have successfully done that.","I'm an Assistant Professor in Astronomy, and I study the dynamic universe. So what I do is, with the beautiful telescopes here at Palomar Observatory, we have some robotic telescopes that are continuously making a movie of the night sky. So we image the sky over and over again, and we look for what changed. You might go out there and think the universe is the same old thing every time, but it's actually not. It's full of these little explosions, which last for a very short amount of time, so they're very energetic. It's like cosmic fireworks lighting up our sky.

It was not at all clear that one day I would do a PhD. I grew up on a farm in India with 100 cows and fields of weeds and chickpeas. And I had left home when I was 15, and I was a girl in India in a small place. The entire community was up in arms. There were people like neighbors, relatives, you name it. People I haven't even seen before coming into the house and trying to talk my parents out of this crazy decision to send their daughter alone on this journey into the other end of the world to pursue something called Astronomy or whatever that was. The community was completely unsupportive.

In my case, the best way to deal with it was to just let that fade away in the background and not engage with it directly but focus on what is motivating me, on what is giving me joy and just let everything else just fade away in the background.",2,519,301
"Yeah, so I want to just tell the story of the time I went on a road trip in the Southwest. I went with my sister and my nephew. I was in high school, and we flew to Phoenix, and then we rented a car. And from Phoenix, we drove to Sedona. We stayed in Sedona for eight days. And then I got to go to, like, Petrified Forest, got to go to Grand Canyon, got to go hiking in Sedona. And then from Sedona, we drove to Vegas. I got to go to Circus Circus and ride around in the rides that they have there. And then from there, we drove to Palm Desert in California to visit a friend. From Palm Desert, we drove to LA, and we stayed in Malibu for a bit. I had fun at Santa Monica Pier in Malibu. And then from Malibu, we drove down to San Diego, and we actually went down to La Jolla, and we stayed in La Jolla for a bit. I got to see some sea lions there, or the otter sea lions, I think they're called. And that was really cool. And then we drove back to Phoenix and stayed at a resort with a water park. It was a lot of fun. And I got to drive through the desert during one of the hottest days of the summer. I got to experience, like, 122 degrees. I got to see, like, the border of Mexico. It was a lot of fun. And now, I'm flying back to Sedona in a few hours. So I'm excited to go on a trip again.","My wife and I traveled to Italy and did an amazing hike in the Dolomite mountain range. I had wanted to do this hike for many years and had researched it quite a bit. I knew it was going to be difficult, but I had no idea how much so. We started early in the morning, and for about four hours, we just kept climbing up higher and higher. It was even more difficult because there were loose rocks under us for much of it.

Every time we reached what we thought was the top, another long uphill awaited us. Finally, after what I figured was another false top, we came up, and it was as though we were at the top of the world. There below us, spreading for 360 degrees, were what seemed like thousands of craggy mountain peaks. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. We both started to cry; it was so beautiful.

There was more crazy hiking to do, however, as we had to use ropes that had been attached to the mountain during World War I to traverse some cliffs and small waterfalls. That was the most difficult part for my wife, and I was so proud of her that she did it. I think she surprised herself.

It was really one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. Even though we pretty much killed ourselves doing it, I think we would both do the same hike again in a heartbeat.",3,322,279
"Yeah. Well, I guess the story I want to tell is about how I went through higher education like undergrad and grad school. And now, I moved back home and I'm ready to transition to industry work. This is the first time I'm moving back home in years. I lived on campus during undergrad and then during grad school. I lived in Hyde Park. So for the last three years, during the COVID-19 pandemic up until last week, I was living in Hyde Park and I was having a great time. But I finally finished school. I have a graduate degree. And now, I'm transitioning to working full-time in my career, which I haven't done before. So I moved back home, which I really dislike because this is my childhood room. I've been in this room for the last almost 27 years. And I have a lot of traumatic memories associated with this bedroom. But before you know it, I'll have a job, and I'll be making money. And then maybe I'll finally be able to get my own apartment or buy a home that I can live in and be away from this place that I really dislike. But for right now, I'm in that part of the journey where I've lived away from home for school, but now I finish school. So now I have to get away from home again.","When I was in school, I wanted to be a doctor. I went to college, and I realized I actually didn't wanna be a doctor. I wanted to do something more in public health. And so, I went to graduate school, and I ultimately got a PhD in international relations and global health.

And then, as I got older, I realized everything affects health. Whether or not someone has a good opportunity or a good job, a chance to go to a community college or four-year college, or medical school.

One of the things I'm so grateful for now, in the work that I do with the Clinton Foundation, is that I get to think about something that I've always been drawn to from all of these different angles. And to ensure that conversations about whether it's just employment or whether it's about energy, also include a health dynamic.

So although I started off wanting to be a doctor and although I never became a doctor, I've figured out what my passion is and how to do that in a way that feels right for me.",5,271,214
"It, yeah. So, I guess a story I have is I will introduce the iMac that I grew up with. This wasn't my first iMac, but this was the iMac I got going into junior high, and I used it throughout high school. And it's one of the early generations of iMacs that came with Intel processors. At the time, it felt like a huge leap forward in technology. Considering the Apple PowerPC processors had limited capabilities with certain software and also processing speeds could be kind of weak with the older iMacs. This was like truly a new generation of computing. This is when I first started getting into virtual reality. The 2009 iMac, that was around the time when internet speed started increasing. This computer is where I moved from dial-up internet over the phone to actually, high-speed broadband internet. And this was like the first computer I was able to have large group chats with lots of people. I was able to do AOL group chats before, but this was the first time I was able to have Skype and be in a Skype room with 60 or 80 plus people. And sometimes these chats would go on for months, where people are logging in and out of these Skype rooms. But it just keeps going. So, I got to meet people from all over the world and just jump back into these conversations that have been going back and forth for sometimes weeks of that month. So, it showed me a new way to connect with the world. Also, having access (a faster processor) for Photoshop or video editing or music editing. All of that you were able to do before, but this was a lot faster, a lot more efficient for me. As a young teenager, I was able to just sit down at the computer and start doing this stuff. And that's when I got more into programming robots and writing code. And when I guess I started getting into computational social science and human-computer interaction. I mean, I was always into that, but this computer was the first one that made me feel like I'm in the future. This is like an advancement. This is where we start making crazy cool technology that becomes wearable and whatnot. So, I felt much more connected to the world around me in terms of like the humans. But I also felt more connected to other technology. And I guess like the Internet of Things kind of set up through this computer. So, this is where I truly feel like I decided that I am into computer science. I like computers and robots and all this. I just felt so much more powerful with this blazing fast computer in front of me. That I was able to do things that I could have only dreamed of doing before.","I wanted something to do on nights and weekends. I wanted to go and use all the new technology of the day, cheap sensors and whatnot. So, just as a passion project, I started building interactive art.

A whole bunch of people would get together after work, a couple of times a month, maybe once a week, to talk about all the fun things we wanted to build.

We started making more stuff, and some of it was totally terrible and nobody wanted to play at all. But some of it people liked. We started building more and more stuff that was completely unrelated to work and served absolutely no practical purpose in the world. We were just making technology for technology's sake. We had no idea it was art until other people started calling it art. We were like, ""Whoa, we're not artists. No way, right?""

There's this very specific road you're supposed to take because the reality is, it's different for everybody.",4,537,259
"So I guess one of the thoughts or stories I've been having is that. I underestimated the amount of time I would need to secure a job after graduate school because I just graduated in August, but had the whole summer to look for a job. Now, I still haven't found a job and looking for jobs. We just kind of recently started looking for jobs, and they haven't found the right fit yet. I'm kind of regretting not looking sooner.","I have had trouble holding jobs ever since I started working. Needing to move for school, locations closing due to COVID-19, and flat-out being underpaid, among other reasons.

Early on in the summer, I applied and arranged an interview with Under Armour (chain sports apparel store) at my local mall. Miraculously, I landed the job and put in a two weeks' notice at my then-current job, a small pizza joint that flat-out refused to give me hours.

I started at Under Armour right away, and surprisingly I genuinely liked it. I get plenty of hours, my teammates are welcoming and kind, and I get paid fairly well. As of yesterday, I've held this job for three and a half months, which is honestly shocking for me. I've felt a lot better about myself since I started working there.",5,93,162
"Well, I just want to say that even though I haven't found a job yet, I'm not necessarily mad about not having found a job because I got to go on a trip to the southwest, which was nice and relaxing because I got to go to Sedona. So, I got to have a little bit of a spiritual cleanse.","I was interested in wine and then sort of thought, ""Wouldn't it be amazing one day to have your own vineyard, make your own wine, and live off the land?""

And then I thought, ""Well, what am I here for?"" To work in a job I'm gonna moan about Monday through Friday or grasp the life that I have and get out there and give it my best shot?

So, we've come together, and she has some of those same dreams, and we're working towards it. I don't ever wanna look back in my life and go, ""I wish I'd done this."" If I wish I'd done something, then I'm gonna do it.",2,68,146
"Yeah. So, when I was in Arizona, my friend and I randomly decided to drive to LA. And I randomly decided to drive to San Diego. And you know, put the Robotics Club. And I went and met up with them at a brewery. And they make, like autonomous vehicles. It's like remote-controlled cars that drive themselves. It was really cool to think about the platform because they basically take, like an off-the-shelf RC car for these Bulldog Car Kits. And then they just put their AI machine learning platform on it. It's like a Raspberry Pi and Arduino. So, they basically take a mechanical system, and then take a software system and they just combine them so essentially, you can turn any mechanical device into a robot. Which was really interesting to think about.","Engineering was exciting to me because it was the creation process of going from an idea to ""I've made this"" or ""this is a better way of doing it.""

We opened up the directory of industrial designers, and we just started cold calling down the list to try to get interviews. We had just graduated from college, so we didn't really know anything about their daily work, so we just asked them to tell us, ""so what do you do, show us where you work. What kind of projects are you working on? What are the problems?""

And one of the patterns was, people had a hard time finding new materials. Finding suppliers, finding how to use it, finding what the options are. It's a whole can of worms that they just didn't know how to do.

I really wanted to realize my maximum potential, and I felt if I just took a job somewhere, then I wouldn't be able to realize it. It would just be whatever they gave you to do.

Today, if you want to build something, the barriers to try are very low. And it really comes back to effort and desire.",3,157,231
"So, I guess, just to kind of start it off today, I wanted to talk about work. I just recently completed a research fellowship and it was really exciting. It really pushed me out of my comfort zone because I've never done anything like that before, nor do I come from a research background or know a whole lot about the subject matter, which was artificial intelligence within the military setting. And so, it was a really interesting learning experience for me. Also, really interesting and something that I was not expecting, the community of people that were there to run the program were also very accepting of people who do not have a technical background, which is me, and then just in terms of the openness and willingness to share all their knowledge and wisdom and really their patience because, like I said, I don't come from a technical background. So, a lot of, well, just about everything that I learned, I was learning for the first time, which is very scary but also really rewarding. I'm excited that I finished the program and really exciting is that after that, I got extended in the program, so I'll get to do some more research stuff and work with the team a little bit longer. This is just really an awesome experience that I'm really proud of. I feel like I haven't work is just typically work and I can't say that there's a lot of things that I've been proud of in terms of my work life, but this is something I am really proud of.","I knew that I wanted to get into tech somehow. But I wasn't sure which field, like mechanical engineering or computer science, and I was really good at math. So I'm like, okay, I wanna do something with math, I wanna explore programming. And that's how I started taking computer classes. And that's really how I came about choosing a direction.

So MINDBODY's mission is to leverage technology to improve the wellness of the world. And so I oversee what's called the data science team, and we do a lot of analyzing of data.

And so a lot of that has to do with just figuring out what the trends are, what kind of shifts we're seeing in the industry in terms of attendance. Are we seeing drops in attendance? Like, for example, people make their New Year's resolutions, right? You see attendance spikes on the first week of January. And then it levels off. We can see those things.

And so I feel like I'm one of the lucky ones who get to actually work in the field that I got to focus on.",3,305,220
"Well, today, I was going to talk about how busy our schedules have been. So, with both of my daughters starting back to school, we start back all of our extracurricular activities. And so, my daughters are both in gymnastics. And then they both play soccer. And so, typically, after school, we go straight from school to soccer and gymnastics practice. And it's really a busy time. But I think the cool part about that, or the interesting part about that is, I didn't really play a whole lot of sports growing up. I think it was just something my parents couldn't really afford or didn't have the time to put me in. And so, it's just kind of interesting now because we don't say no to our kids, and we let them explore and do all the sports that they want. It makes our schedules really crazy. And it does make for some really long days. But it is also really neat and cool. It makes me really proud as a parent to see my kids succeed in the various sports that they've taken on.","Monday, my daughter started ""Big Girl School""!!! She has officially entered Kindergarten! Being in school isn't new to her though. She has been in Pre-K for a year, so she is used to getting up, putting on a uniform, and even being around the big kids. She was very excited to start Kindergarten.

I, however, am not ready for her to be so ready. She went to bed early at 7 PM and the lights went off! I woke her up to our traditional ""Wake Up Song."" I've been singing her this song since she was a baby; this stirs up the emotions knowing she is now a ""big kid."" Sometimes she sings along…sometimes she pulls the covers over her head.

I also got up early to cook breakfast. Our daily breakfast consists of egg whites, turkey bacon, and fruit. Every once in a while, I will let her eat her favorite cereal, but we keep it healthy! She only ate a little bit. I reckon she was nervous.

So we grabbed her sparkly book bag, lunchbox that looks like a purse, and her huge shopping bag of school supplies and headed to school. I am very blessed that her school is only 5 minutes from our home. We got there in no time, and I walked her inside.

The teachers had the kids sectioned off in the cafeteria by grade. I went to give her a kiss before she sat down, and she covered her face!!! Later she told me that other kids would make fun of her. BUT IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN!!!

Looks like my baby girl is already grown!!!",4,218,329
"So last night, I got to go out with some of my friends - a good group of friends, and their parents. And it kind of just brought up all those nostalgic feels of being a kid again and hanging out with everyone, socializing, and laughing. And it was just a really good time. And it felt really good just to spend time with good friends who have known you for a long time, and you feel safe and comfortable with, and you can giggle and laugh and just share stories together.","On July 4th, I was at home in the morning doing nothing and feeling kind of sad. I unexpectedly got a call from one of my friends, and she invited me out with her and her boyfriend. I was kind of surprised and pleased at the same time. 

We ended up going to the movies to see Spider-Man, and it was such a funny movie. After that, we got dinner at a local Mexican restaurant nearby. I ordered tacos, and my friends ordered nachos to share. 

We left the restaurant after finishing our meals and saw a food truck selling ice cream across the street. We decided to get ice cream cones for dessert. We walked about for a bit while we ate our ice cream and chatted about different things. 

About an hour later, we found the perfect spot on the grass near a bridge with an open view of the sky. My friend made a comment that it would be the perfect spot to stay and watch the fireworks. I agreed, and we sat down and waited for the show to start. 

After the fireworks show was over, we all went home. I felt so happy that my friend wanted to share that holiday with me, and it made my entire day so much better. I was very happy.",3,102,245
"Week. So, this weekend was nice because we got to take just a long weekend, and we got to spend a lot of time with family. And one of the people that we got to spend time with was my younger brother and his wife and my niece. And they are pregnant with their second. And so, she's due any day now. And it really just kind of got me thinking because my husband and I have two kids. And we're getting older. And we probably won't have any more kids. We've never said never. But I just feel like we're kind of at our max with what we can manage right now with our two kids. And so, I really feel like that probably is it for us. Which is wonderful. We have two really great kids. But it does kind of leave me wondering of what life can be like if we had another one. \n\nI also very much so miss being pregnant, which I know sounds funny because most people hate being pregnant, but I really enjoyed it. And I really enjoyed even though you're tired and there's a lot that goes into it. I really enjoyed the baby phase, too. And I think now it's different as our kids are getting older, everything is kind of like, okay, well, that's the last time we're going to experience that phase. Or that's the last time this is going to happen because we don't have any more babies to come after it. And it does make me a little sad. And it kind of leaves me wondering. I feel like it's that weird, like am I making the right decision? Should we have more babies? Should this just be kind of left with a bunch of questions? I think in my heart, I know that our two kids are perfect. And that's really great for us right now. But I think there's a part of me still that's just like, well, I wonder what it would be like if we had a third kid. So it's just kind of processing and going through all those emotions. And I don't know it just really got me reflecting a little bit.","Five months ago, my niece and nephew were born. They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt. It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins!

When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit them. I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted. They wanted to spend time alone as a new family.

I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece, especially, was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins.

They were both so perfect and tiny. It was like holding tiny dolls. I will never forget that day. I love them more than I ever expected I would.",3,433,189
"Okay. So it's good that we talked about work because something that has been popping into my brain quite a bit is the fact that today is Tuesday, and it's one of my busiest days. Both my husband and I work typically about eight-hour days. And then both of our kids go to school. After school gets out, we go immediately to extracurricular activities. Both of our daughters do gymnastics, and then after gymnastics, we go straight into soccer practice. So it's a really long day for us. And we typically get home around seven or a little bit before seven. I currently get to work from home, which is really nice because then I have some flexibility in my schedule and I can really do a work like that. Or attempt to do some sort of work-life balance. But eventually, I will have to go back into the office. And it's something that's been really weighing on my mind because my wife really is trying to support my kids and being there for my husband. And being in the office for eight hours a day makes that very difficult to try to get all the other aspects of your life organized and things accomplished. And so I'm just kind of worried about what that might look like when I do go back into the office.","I knew that I wanted to get into tech somehow. But I wasn't sure which field, like mechanical engineering or computer science, and I was really good at math. So I'm like, okay, I wanna do something with math, I wanna explore programming.

"I wanted to talk about my oldest daughter today. So today, at her school, they're having Grandparents Day, which is a really cool thing where they invite all of the kids' grandparents to come and eat breakfast with them. Grandchildren in the morning before school actually starts. They do like a nice little spread in the cafeteria for them, so that way kids can talk to their grandparents about school and experience that with them. And it's just really cool. When I was growing up, I did not live close to (.) I grew up in a military family, so we kind of traveled a little bit, and we didn't live close to my grandparents. I don't really have a close relationship with my grandparents. But, where myself and my husband live now, we live like less than a mile away from our in-laws. So my kids get to see their grandparents quite often. And it just really makes me happy and brings me joy. And I'm so thankful that they have that relationship with them. And I'm thankful that they're able to go and eat breakfast with her this morning. She was so excited when she woke up for school this morning. It was one of the easier days to kind of get her out the door. So it just brings me a lot of joy and happiness, and I'm glad that they have that relationship and are able to do things like that.","This summer my granddaughter turned 1 year old. She comes over and spends each weekend with me and my family here. My daughter that had her is only 19, and I had her young as well, so I am a young grandmother. I really enjoy bonding with this little girl as it lets me almost in a way relive being a mom because I'm not even 40 yet and I have a grandchild.

Well, this summer I decided that she should come over to our house to have some fun on the 4th of July. My daughter agreed, so we had a nice family get-together at my house for the holiday. During this day, we spent some time feeding her some grilled food and just playing with her, having a really great time on her first 4th of July.

Then the night started to roll in upon us and where I love, we can still shoot fireworks. We had bought a lot of ones to be done at night because I'm a big fan of the pretty shiny style of fireworks. So we took this little girl outside so she could get a good look at all of the fireworks. We slowly began to shoot them off one after another.

I watched the look on this child's face as she just got so excited, hearing the noises and watching all of the pretty colors. It really touched me to remember what it could have been like for me or even my children when they got that excited for something like this. It really made me feel good that we could make this child so happy by doing something so simple for her.

We continued shooting off all of these awesome fireworks we had bought, including some really huge ones that lit up the entire sky. We did this until we were done, and the baby never lost her excitement and continued to smile and scream out during the entire process. It really was a great night and time for the baby's first 4th of July Party.",5,281,377
"Okay. So I have been working at a bakery for the last month, part-time, because I quit my job and traveled. And now I\'m here. So far, working in a bakery has been really cool. It\'s been really interesting to work with my coworkers and be in an environment that I really like. It\'s been a long time since I worked in person. My last job was all virtual, with some hybrid events, but for the most part, working in person has been good to create a separation from work and my home, which was hard to do when I was working virtually. So that\'s what I really like about this job, that physical separation and that my coworkers and I all get along. My manager is very understanding and she explains everything in a way that I can understand and encourages me, saying, ""Oh, don\'t worry, you\'re just learning. You\'ll speed up."" So yeah, I really like my work environment. For now, I am looking for other opportunities. But for now, I think it\'s good that I\'m getting this experience at a bakery because it gives me something physical to do. Also, it\'s creative. But I\'ve been having a hard time finding which creative outlet to pursue. But with decorating there, I feel like that creative side of my interest is being satisfied.","I'm a final inspector over in the additive area. What I do on a day-to-day basis is I actually inspect the parts to make sure we are shipping quality parts out the door in a timely manner. My upbringing, my parents, they always just pushed the issue of work hard.

I wound up moving to Atlanta, working for a company called RightStar Systems. We just installed motherboards, graphic cards in different computers.

As I was looking online, I just happened to see GE Aviation hiring. As a kid, you see the light bulbs, you see the microwaves, so GE is the top brand. So of course, I was like, ""I gotta apply, I gotta see what's going on there.""

So just work hard, have a good head, have a good attitude, and you can pursue any job field that you wanna pursue.",3,269,172
"Story. Okay, so stories from Massachusetts. I think my more notable ones are just playing outside or just hanging out outside in Phoenix. I think when I was younger, I did play outside, but I think as I got older, it was less available. And plus, the temperature has really increased a lot. Like, it\'s gone really hot in Phoenix. So I think, in my opinion, from like March to October, it\'s really unbearable being outside, like late March till late October. And so I think being in Massachusetts, like, wow, this is actually livable weather. Like, you can actually walk around and the sun\'s not trying to kill you. So I think my most memorable memories are all the times I spend outside.\n\nSo my first time playing in the snow, Massachusetts. We had snow, and then while we had this hill that\'s called Seven Hill, where it\'s the one big hill on campus everyone slides down. So every time whenever I had free time, I would try to convince my friends, like, come on, we got to go, we got to go. So then we would use whatever we had, like cardboard boxes, lids from our bins. And I really convinced, I remember I always got my roommate out to go play in the snow. And it was just really fun just being out there with my friend Juanita because I pulled her onto the snow multiple times.\n\nAnd then also as the spring came through, we made snowmen in the snow and then in the springtime. At least the most recent, this past well, at least the last spring I was in Massachusetts with my friends. I also pulled them out into the outside. So we had like picnics, not very often, though occasionally we had picnics. But I think one of the funniest memories from being in the springtime was when I was just very enthusiastic about flying a kite because I hadn\'t flown a kite in years. And we don\'t really get much wind in Phoenix. At least not the times that I remember a little bit this spring.\n\nSo I happened to be at the Dollar store and I bought these, like, one dollar kites, and I thought we just have to use it somehow. And then one day, it was, like, a nice sunny day, with a Sunday, and it was a Sunday morning. So I\'m, like, my friends are not doing their homework yet because we cram, like, 5:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., so I try to convince them all to come outside. And we ended up flying kites. And I think the funniest part was that we took turns flying the kite to the point because they\'re one dollar, so they\'re very cheap and cheaply made so they would break. So then, I had to go find tape to try to fix them. And even when it was trying to fly the broken kites, the most memorable time from this experience was when my friend, my friendo, she was running and she flew the kite, and it got stuck in the tree. And at this point, everyone was watching us because Walshy students always studied. They\'re never outside hanging out. So then they were like, wow, these people are out here. So we had like a crowd watching us. And everyone got sad that the kite had gotten stuck in the tree. And I really was like, the kite is a goner. We\'re never seeing it again. Like, goodbye. And then out of nowhere, my friend kept playing at it. She was determined to get it out of the tree. I was like, oh, you know, it\'s okay. It\'s okay to give up. It\'s gone. And then, out of nowhere, like this giant gust of wind comes in and, like, swooshes the kite out of the tree unexpectedly. And it\'s flying in the air. And she\'s running, screaming, ""I got it, guys! I got it!"" And then everyone watching us starts cheering and clapping. It was just so weird. So then I got the kite back. But it was just such a fun memory. And to have a crowd watching us do that was really cool.","I won the dodgeball game for my team. I'm in ROTC, and we have to do early morning physical training. Usually we run and do calisthenics, but today was a little easier - dodgeball.

I was the last one standing and caught a ball, thereby getting the rest of my team back into the game, and I also happened to throw the ball that got their last player out.

I'm not sporty; this was just a lucky confluence of shenanigans that made me happy, probably my new proudest sports moment.",2,833,103
"So, I wanted to talk a little bit about my day because I thought it was very interesting. So today, since I don't drive, I used public transit the whole day, which normally would be fine if it was any other city that wasn't Phoenix. Because I've lived in different cities where I didn't need a car, where I could literally just walk. It's walkable. I can just use public transit because I don't have a license. So today was kind of like a challenge with public transit, but I did it on purpose because I was like, I need to try it out, to remind me and to give me a sense of agency so that I can leave and come back. For the most part, what I found was just that I wish we had better infrastructure for public transit. In the sense that we had more frequency of routes and then routes weren't spread out per mile. It was like half a mile or more. And if, I don't know, city planners had designed the city better so that it's high rise or at least there's more shading, like more trees along the sidewalk, anyways. So every time I use public transit, I always rethink about how we're prioritizing the world around us and who is it really benefiting and versus what are the communities that need more needs? At least, when I ride public transit in the US, when I ride public transit in other countries, I'm like, wow, efficient. What? I guess today's story is just about my thoughts along public transit, but it was pretty cool because I was able to time things well coincidentally to that point that I could meet the woman that I met with to talk about her career at the coffee shop. And then I was able to meet with my friends. And she works downtown Phoenix. In downtown Phoenix, I was able to get a bus that goes directly there and then take the train that we have back here. So I think it was pretty smooth. I just wish that urban planners had planned the city better and it wasn't so spread out in an inconvenient way.","I think I've always had that fire in my belly for impact. An exercise in a leadership course that I took helped kind of solidify this for me that you need to find your sweet spot. The way we define sweet spot is if you look at like a Venn Diagram of three circles overlapping, one circle is what you're passionate about. The next circle is skills, what do you excel in? And then the third circle is your values. So where the three overlap, that's your sweet spot.

So for me, I loved the idea of events. I loved the idea of people coming together and learning and engaging and sharing. And then I realized I wanna figure out a way to impact the world around me. And so I decided in 2008 to go off and start a business. And we work with government agencies, cities, corporations, nonprofits, and large-scale events on implementing sustainability plans.

I love the impact and the work that we're able to do all over the world. And so I think it's really important to really embrace who you are and all of your decisions, so respect that. Respect your gut feeling. It's coming from somewhere. It's coming from inside, and I think it's important to really make sure that you're staying true to yourself and your own personal mission.",4,424,262
"Okay. So this is a story of, I guess, one of my big hobbies. At least, it\'s less big now, but it was definitely like a big thing I did last year. My sister and I started playing Pokemon Go. And it started off just because one of my sisters, the oldest one, we\'ll call her K. She actually doesn\'t matter. But anyways, my older sister downloaded the app, and she was like, ""This is so cool. You have to download it, too."" And then that\'s kind of how it started. But basically, Pokemon Go is this app that is like closely related to the game and the anime cartoon called Pokemon. So it\'s like a world of where people train these Pokemon that are kind of like wild animals with magical powers or like superpowers. And they train them and they use them for battle. And it\'s a whole competition between one trainer and their pets/monsters/animals against another one. And it\'s like training to know, basically it\'s like who knows their pets the best and can use them and their unique abilities. So anyway, Pokemon Go tries to be similar. It basically brings the show to life, and it blew up a couple of years ago when it first launched because Pokemon has a huge fan base, like people who are super dedicated and some that are less. But I never got into it because I just didn\'t have the proper phone for it. But now that I have a better quality phone and I had free time last year, that\'s when I really got into Pokemon Go. So basically, this game takes place in the real world, also, where it forces you to walk around and map out little places to catch these Pokemon monsters. So it brings their real world to life. And so it actually really did bring the real world to life because my sisters and I are blue team, like at least we call her blue team. And because we got so into it, we started seeing common players around our neighborhood because it turns out that other people around us played also. And every park or public space becomes a space for Pokemon Go. So parks are like a common space where you can train your Pokemon. You put them in little gyms, like a whole thing. But basically, my sister, sisters, and I became the Blue team. And we called ourselves the Triple Threat because there were three of us. And we would always play together. We would match our outfits. And we would match Pokemon. So once we took over a gym from the other teams, there\'s two other teams, there\'s Yellow and red. Yellow is Team Instinct. Red is Team Valor. And then what team are we? Mystic. Mystic. Basically, there are all these teams. And we were the blue team. We call ourselves the Triple Threat because we were, like, always together playing Pokemon Go. But then I think people caught onto us. And the red team specifically created their own team. And we never met these people in real life. Okay. So my sister and I developed this rivalry with this virtual gang. And basically, this team was, they also started dressing alike, and we\'re not entirely sure if they all know each other. Our best guess is they mostly know each other because they all sometimes are in the same gym together, but sometimes they\'re not. And then they would match Pokemon. And when they beat up our Pokemon, they would match sometimes. Similarly. So we developed this whole online rivalry with this team, and we would kick them out of the gym and then be strategic to not let them put in their Pokemon. We were like, full-on battling these people. And I think it\'s even funnier because, where I live, I live in the hood of Phoenix. So I tried all my life to avoid gangs. And here I am, in a virtual one that\'s like not even serious. But yes, I think it was funny the whole summer we had that little rivalry. But then I think once the summer ended, we all kind of got really busy because then I got started on like a full-time job I had. And then everyone else went back to school. So I think this rivalry we had, I\'m pretty sure it\'s with a bunch of teenagers. And we\'re, like, older. But that is the summer I joined a Pokemon gang, and we had a whole turf war in our little neighborhood.","In August of 2019, I visited friends in Detroit. They were friends that I've had for several years, but this was the first time we would be meeting in person. We met playing League of Legends online, and we are all fans of the professional scene of that game as well. So when finals were going to be hosted in Detroit, it seemed like a perfect time to visit both my friends and also go see this event I've loved so much live.

We went to Little Caesars Arena and got to watch one of our favorite teams battle it out against the top team in North America. I don't go to a lot of sporting events, so it was novel for me to get swept up in a cheering crowd or scream when something awesome happened on stage. Unfortunately, they lost, but the games were close. My favorite moment was getting to hear one of my favorite songs live and hear the stadium hum and sing along to it.

Although a close second was getting to go backstage. We didn't get to meet any of the professional players, but we got to meet the tour manager. Backstage was amazing to see; they basically had to set up a whole home office just for a weekend.

Besides just the event, I got to play games with my friends in person and hang out in their houses, and I loved every moment of it. I also brought my dog with because I talk to him constantly while I'm in a call with my friends, so it felt right that they would finally get to meet him.

The drive there and back was long, about 12 hours both ways. But I didn't mind it because I listened to podcasts the whole way. I did make the mistake of listening to a murder podcast just as it was getting dark, so that actually did make me a little anxious.",2,889,362
"Oh, so, I guess for my sister\'s plans for today, like how we\'re going to take her to University. And I think a lot of it really reminds me of my first time going to College alone. Well, I didn\'t go to College alone, but basically, I was the first in my family to go to University outside of state. My sister, my older sister was the oldest. One and the first one to go to College ever because my family. No one really holds degrees. Where they\'re like Immigrants to the us. So it\'s like a whole complication thing there with education, not transferring or not going to University because it\'s expensive. So I feel really privileged to be to have been one of the first in my family to go to College. But it\'s definitely really hard because my parents don\'t have the same background as they don\'t have the same understanding of what it means to go to College in the US or what College really is. So it would be hard to relate with other friends that do have family and support system so. It really so I guess. It\'s like me thinking back about when I was first going through wellesley. So I went to Wales College in Massachusetts. So I\'m from Arizona. So that\'s a huge flight. It\'s like 6 hours flight. And pretty much the day I got dropped off or the weekend I got dropped off, I think it\'s super memorable in my mind because. It was me, two of my sisters, and my mom. So it\'s like all four of us were going, we couldn\'t really afford flights for other people. And it was kind of to me, a miracle that we could afford these flights to Massachusetts. It was thanks to my sister\'s good paying job at the time, but really I was surprised anyone could go. I was prepared to go by myself because we didn\'t really have much money. We took an overnight flight similar to this, but it was a direct flight, but they didn\'t sleep. But I can sleep through anything. So I slept through the flight. I don\'t know. I don\'t remember how many days we were there, but I think it was just very rushed and. It was like chaotic. Because we went so we had it over. And I thought, ""Can you kick Elvis out? He\'s kind of, thank you."" So I just see it as like a whirlwind, like I don\'t even remember really how the event unfolded. I just remember going overnight and then landing in Boston, and it was my first time in Boston with my family first time exploring. So then. I got to explore Boston that day, like I had a whole itinerary planned. I think that was like one of the starts of my travel crazy. The travel bug had a whole itinerary. I had my parent or my mom and my older sisters and everyone, like running through Boston, trying to get everything done as much as possible. For only one day. And then we went to the hotel, slept. And then the next day we went to wellesley. And it was just like a really cool experience to have them move me in. So I didn\'t have to do it alone. They helped move me in, and it was like the hottest day in Massachusetts. It just felt gross. And it was humid growth. And we\'re not used to humidity at all. So everything felt so sticky and stuffy. And there\'s no air conditioning in any of the dorms that well, we at least at the time, pretty much still not. So then there are no dorm, like there\'s no air conditioning. So it was like we\'re all hot and sweaty. And then I was meeting my roommate for the first time. And the room was so tiny. It was so small, we could all barely fit. And I just remember things like it was so crazy. The whole day was very hot and chaotic. And then. Afterwards, after we set up my Bay, we took, like, a photo. And it was like, oh, really cute of us all together. And then we got to meet my roommate, which is pretty cool because she\'s Colombian. So it was nice that my mom was able to speak like her native language with my roommates. There wasn\'t a language barrier for them, and they felt like more entrusting that I was going to stay with their daughter. It was just a nice experience. It\'s really nice when my. Friends or my friend\'s family speaks Spanish because then my parents can relate to them on a better level than English. So I was really thankful for that. So I just remember it being just very hot and humid and gross. But we got it all set up. And then we went to maybe a couple of us. It really is a blur. Like, I just feel like from the moment that we set up the better then it was like, okay, time to kick the parents out. Go away. So then. My parents and my sisters left. And then I stick back. And then it was like. A whole weird initiation ceremony that all these students have. But Yeah. It was just like very chaotic. Two to three days, maybe. But. It was definitely a good worthwhile experience for being the first. For being dropped off and on my own for the first time. To kind of fend for myself in life. Well, the wilderness. I don\'t know. So it was really cool. So this is what my current plan for today reminds me of, they remind me of this experience of being dropped off at University. And just kind of navigating it on my own from there.","As a freshman, my first year of college had its ups and downs. It probably had some of the darkest moments of my life, from times of intense loneliness sitting at the dining hall alone, to self-hatred at feeling stupid whenever I had no idea how to approach a pset.

But, as I realized when I started tearing up as I began to empty out my dorm room, was that I love it here. I've met incredible people. Learned incredible things. Grown so much as a person.

Going home and hanging out with my home friends is cool and all, but there's something about being here, about feeling like I have the entire world at my fingertips, that I'll miss. I'm so lucky to have come here, and I can't wait to return next fall.",5,1137,157
"Story, okay. I don't have a story first, per se, but I think I just have a lot of emotions that I'm working through right now, and I just feel like. I don't know, tearing up a bit. But I guess I'm just worried for the rest of this month. I just feel overwhelmed with how many birthday celebrations there are. I know it's funny, but I don't know. I just feel like there are so many birthdays in my family. And then there's also my birthday, and I'll be turning 24, which is weird because I feel like, wow, I'm actually growing up. Now my age is showing. It's because I always felt very mature for my age. But now I'm like, oh, I'm not still young, but I feel like, wow, I'm getting older. I'm 24. So I think I just feel overwhelmed by the amount of, like, I guess gifts I have to buy and just the events you have to show up for. I think like parties and that I'm not in the greatest place financially, just given the type of jobs my family works. And then, even though I have a degree from like a really good university, I don't have a high-paying job. I'm working at the bakery, which is minimum wage. There are a lot of goals on the side I'm saving up for. So I just feel overwhelmed by trying to save money towards the goals that I'm working towards, but then also paying bills. And then trying to buy gifts and stuff for celebrations for my family and people who have birthdays in September. I swear I have like eight birthdays in December, and it's like a little overwhelming. Maybe even more because I have friends who are also in September, and I feel bad not getting them gifts, but... Yeah, I think I'm just overwhelmed with, I guess, the social, financial connection. Like, to hang out with people, you have to spend money. And I just feel like I'm still trying to save money and I want to say get back on my feet. I don't know. I have a lot of worries in my mind. And I did have, after I graduated from university, I did have a good-paying job for a couple of months. Because the company, it was just not a good company. It was just a really stressful work environment. But I was getting paid, like, double what I make now in terms of hourly wage. And I guess sometimes I just get stuck thinking like, wow, I really left that job. It was paying me well, for given that I didn't have other benefits. I feel like it was paying me relatively well compared to, like, it was the most amount of money I've ever made in my life, but I'm also young. And I don't come from a lot of financial, I don't come from much financial privilege. So it's like I still have complicated feelings with accepting or forgiving myself. I don't know what it's forgiving, but if you can go came with leaving a job that paid me more money, and then feeling more limited financially despite graduating from like a prestigious university. I just have a lot of worries right now connected to finances and birthday celebrations and trying to still spend time with friends and family, but trying to save up for goals I have but then also paying bills and try not to let it get to me, but it's like a lot. And I'm not the only one feeling like this. I know my family definitely feels pressure. I think there's just a lot of with the expenses right now, I think inflation is really high. Groceries are very high. It just feels like the cost of living is so expensive now. I know I'm not alone, but that also really sucks because it makes me feel like when can we escape this cycle of struggling? Like, what? Will I have enough money to feel comfortable and not worry about paying bills? And the crazy part is like even with the college degree, it's just wild. So I just have all these complicated feelings attached to leisure and finances and goals and relationships, and I'm having a hard time coping with that. It comes in waves, but yeah. So I have all those worries. I don't know if you have... It's just rough.","I'm 26, have a bachelor's degree in math, but I burned out of my master's program before finishing. I crashed and burned my last semester and don't even know how I'd get back into university if I wanted. Anything academic-related that I like doesn't have good career outlooks, e.g. pure math, history, humanities. The only real obligation is my vehicle payment and whatever I spend on living every month.

I work at a paper mill as a production operator. The people suck, the job is okay but not intellectually fulfilling. It's just do this, that. Part of me wants to learn a trade, but part of me wants to go back to college. I'm stuck in an identity crisis mixed with heavy indecisiveness.

I chose the wrong path in grad school and it cost me two years of my life and I'm scared any decision I make will end up being the wrong one. I'm making decent money at my job, and I'd hate to give it up for another that won't work out. I was raised blue collar, but feel much more at home culturally within certain sects of academia, which is a big part of the identity crisis.

For the last two months or so, I've been trying to figure out what I want to do, but I've gotten nowhere and just go through the day-to-day grind hoping one day I'll miraculously have some vision of what I should do. A professor I knew went through something similar for a few years--a period he referred to as ""the lost years.""

If I could do it again, I think I'd choose academia, but between the bad grades and shame of my 2nd year of grad school plus not being poor for the first time in 26 years, I don't even know if that's an option.",4,888,360
"Okay, so today I want to talk about the kindness of strangers. I guess, yeah, I guess it\'s just been on my mind occasionally. About, it kind of relates to the theme of why I like to travel. So I don\'t know. So I guess, hold on. So I\'ve been thinking about the kindness of strangers, and I don\'t know why. But I have a couple of experiences from my travels because I think when I\'m traveling, that\'s when it\'s more apparent to me how much I have to rely on not just myself but rely on the kindness of people I don\'t know.\n\nAnd I guess the more recent example was one time my friend and I, she had a job in Barcelona, so I visited her. And so from Barcelona, we took an overnight bus to Bordeaux, France. And it was like kind of not a great bus trip. It was very cold for no reason. And it was just wild or very hot. It was just uncomfortable. But during one of the 3:00 a.m. bus stops, we had like, at 3:00 a.m., we got to go to the bus to the restroom. And I don\'t know, the guy, the bus driver would only speak to me in French. And I was like, I don\'t know French. And I already did not have a good impression of France because everyone I\'ve ever met who\'s gone to France just tells me about how rude they are and how such bad experiences they had in France. So I never want to go to France in my life. But it was the cheapest place her and I could afford to go. So then we went. And it was just, I guess that kind of helped change my perspective on French people, at least in Southern France, because I didn\'t really have a rude experience. I kind of did. But I feel like strangers made up for it. And strangers kind of helped me out because the bus driver only spoke to me in French. And I know Spanish. So I tried Spanish. My friend and I, our strategy was to only talk in Spanish to French people. Because we thought like maybe they\'ll have less bias against us, maybe they have a bias against Americans. Because the bus driver only spoke to me in French, and he knew a little bit of English. But I was like, what is happening? And it was just weird. This guy stepped in and translated because he realized I spoke Spanish. So he basically translated what the guy was telling me, the bus driver was telling me in French to Spanish. And then I started talking to him and got to know a little bit about him. It turns out he was from like, Venezuela, and he was living in France, and he was helpful in giving us advice about what to do in Bordeaux. It was really kind and I think, I don\'t know. I feel like he might be, maybe he was hitting on me or something because he ended up asking for my number or whatever, but I brushed it off because I was alone. My friend went to the bathroom without me, and I was like, this is awkward. But later on, in the same bus ride, there was like no set scheduled. This was like a rogue bus trip. It just seemed like this bus wasn\'t really doing good announcements of what stop we were on. So you just had to keep track of where you were and where you\'re getting off. And this woman, she sat next to me. I really didn\'t have an empty seat and she sat next to me and she was French. But she was speaking to me in English after I told her I don\'t speak French. I\'m sorry. And she was just nice and she helped me practice some French translations. And then, after when it got to my bus stop, I realized that she had woken me up because I was already kind of waking up because I wasn\'t sure if that was our bus or not because we had gone into our stop early. And it was just nice because she woke me up and she\'s like, ""Hey, is this your stop?"" And it was just really nice that she did that. And then it turns out that the guy, the guy from Venezuela, I saw him look back to make sure. I think he was looking back to make sure I was awake and then saw me then turned away. Even I didn\'t get to say bye but, I was just kind of like surprised that, oh, these people were looking out for me, making sure I was getting off at the right stop, because clearly I didn\'t know what I was doing, like me and my friend didn\'t know what we were doing. And then that\'s just like one of many examples of random kindness.\n\nOn another bus ride to Italy. I know a little bit of Italian but I definitely was like, I was kind of confused about where I was on the map and when I was going to meet my friend in rural Italy. And I thought it was nice that I asked around like ""We\'ll stop at this"" in Italian and then people were also confused. But then the bus driver, I guess I thought it was really kind of him, because the assistant when he realized like, ""Oh yeah, this girl does not, she\'s not local. She has no idea where she\'s going, she\'s going to the middle of nowhere, Italy"". I guess when he realized that he made sure that I was getting off at the stop, because he made sure to ask me, ""What stop am I getting off at?"" So yeah, it was just nice that they were looking out. I really appreciate moments when locals or other people look out for me. And then it makes me want to give back in that way. And like some ways I\'ve done that have been like there was one time I got sick in Portugal. I just did a lot of traveling this past year, yeah. So it was in Portugal with my friend and I got sick randomly. So we\'re hoping it wasn\'t COVID. And thankfully it wasn\'t. And I got like really strong medicine, cough drops, like really strong. They worked really well. And then I was getting over it. But then this woman in our hostel, she was coughing a lot. And she only spoke Portuguese. And I wanted to help her out. So then I spoke Spanish and I know that you can speak Spanish and Portuguese and mutually understand each other to some extent. So while she was only speaking to me in Portuguese, I only spoke to her in Spanish. And I told her like, ""Oh, I have these cough drops. They\'re going to help your throat. Take them. They\'re here. They\'re from Portugal. They\'re not from another country"". And then so she was very thankful and we got to talking. And she added me on Instagram. And she was an older woman, I think she\'s like in her 40s, maybe 50s. I think 40s. So I repaid it then, like, I repaid the favor of looking out for other people. Another time in Turkey, this guy was like, he had no charge on his phone. And he had no charger, I guess his charger had died. And he asked me for a charger and I was like, ""Oh, I actually have an extra, you can keep"". So I gave him an extra one. It was like a cheaper one. It was like the randomest thing. And I was like, ""Okay, here. You\'re not going to find us here"". I don\'t know. So yeah, I helped him that way. So it\'s nice to have been helped on these travels and then to also pass it along and help other people. So I think traveling restores my faith in humanity a bit when I get to connect with locals and when I have these authentic experiences.","Where I live, there is one really busy intersection that always has at least two homeless people combing it for food and stuff, and most of them you can tell are fakers looking for money and pity (dogs, phones, new clothes). But today was different.

This guy was obviously in pain. He was hunched over a little bit, and limped really slowly. He looked pretty elderly, and when he spoke, it was very heavy and slow, as if it was a task.

I always have food on me specifically because I feel bad for the homeless there, and today I had two fig bars. The car in front of me gave him a pastry, and you could tell he was pretty happy.

His sign was pretty beat up, and all I could read was ""hungry,"" so I gave him one of my fig bars. He noticed what it was, and he perked up and began thanking me over and over, saying that pastries and fig bars were ""his favorite thing in the whole world."" So, I gave him the other one I had, and he looked at me as if he couldn't believe it.

He said, ""Thank you so much, man. I love fig bars. You have a blessed day. God bless you,"" and I got chills because he was so genuine and grateful. It made me so happy knowing that I had given someone who had nothing their favorite thing in the whole world!",5,1582,288
"Okay. So I wanted to talk about cultural differences and the concept of time because I think it\'s very interesting. And I think it\'s something that people overlook, at least in a diverse place like the United States where we have people from different cultures and different backgrounds. I think sometimes our miscommunications tend to be because of our cultural differences and awareness and difference in experiences. Anyways, I think a lot of it\'s misunderstandings. But I think one of my, sorry, let me just. Okay. So I think one of my most recent experiences was when I went to Japan for a couple of days because I traveled a lot this year, thankfully. And one of the spontaneous trips was to Japan, and it was me and my friend and her sister, the same friend Re. So Me, Ari, and her sister were together. And we\'re all Mexican Americans. Our families are from Mexico. So our concept of time is more laid back, more like, oh, yeah, it\'s okay if we show up 15-20 minutes late, maybe a little bit later. So we\'re more flexible with time and meetings. All of the Americans are a little bit more punctual, so it\'s always a duality we had to deal with, but in this case, we took a more laid back approach. And we were traveling with her friend who\'s Korean. So she\'s Korean and about our age. And she described Korean time as being like, only ten minutes late, max. She was like, you can be five minutes away, you could be ten minutes away, but max. Okay. She was like, you have to be punctual and not more than ten minutes late. And this morning, it was the morning that we were going to DisneySea because she wanted to go to Disney. C. It was her dream to go to DisneySea. We had planned to meet the Korean friend, eugene. So her Korean friend brought her friend who\'s Japanese. Okay. And it was our first time going to meet him. And it was going to be very exciting because it\'s like, wow, we\'re in Japan with someone who\'s Japanese. And then eugene speaks Japanese. So that would help with the language barrier. So in the morning, we\'re getting ready. We stayed up late because we\'re fools and then we woke up and it was a rush to get ready because everyone gets ready at different speeds. Like, I take about an hour, one of my friends takes a long time, oh my gosh, it takes so long. The Korean friend takes so long. And then the other friend, the sister, is quick. So we all have different speeds of getting ready. And then on top of that, we didn\'t realize the different concepts of time. Like, whenever eugene would say, we have to leave at 7:10 because it would be an hour commute, she said, we have to leave at seven. And in my head, I was like, why do I think that\'s enough? It\'s going to be fine; trains come so quickly here. It\'s going to be fine to catch the next one. But then I went to go grab food or even before I went to grab breakfast from the 7-Eleven, I realized, I was like, Wait, guys, we have to hurry. We\'re meeting a Japanese person. They\'re on time if not early. And then that\'s when we all started freaking out because by all, it\'s like me and the other two Mexican Americans were like, we have to hurry now because it\'s like, we can\'t be disrespectful to this person who we are meeting for the first time. We were laughed because we were like, we\'re running on Mexican time. We have to hurry up. We have to hurry up. So it became like this mad rush to hurry to leave exactly at the time eugene said because eugene was just being very polite and was like, yeah, we should leave at like, seven. We should leave at seven. And then now that we have this understanding of like, oh, her friend\'s going to show up early, we cannot be disrespectful and show up late. So we\'re like, we have to go now. So it was like a mad rush. We were running to the station and then we were panicked the whole time. And at the same time that we were kind of like anxious that we were going to be late, our friend was teaching us Japanese phrases that we would be familiar with. And one of them was, I don\'t know if I\'m pronouncing it right, but it was something along the lines of ""it\'s very nice to meet you for the very first time"". So that was another cultural nuance because we were practicing on that train ride. Like, we had to get it right. It was our first time, and the only time we could ever say it to him. Because you can\'t say that again. We finally did. We missed, like, one train, I think. And then we finally made it to the station and we were actually early. We were actually like, early on the time that we had said, and we were so proud of ourselves. We were like, oh, we did it. But it definitely was one of the most poignant examples of cultural differences and how it could be very different when you\'re traveling with people from different cultures because you have a different understanding of time, and then there\'s also, and it was very interesting because throughout the day I really noticed different understandings of how we approach eating and how we talk about beauty. But that was through conversations and we talked from the lens of Mexico, then America, the United States, and then Japan and Korea. So it was like, I guess a very insightful day for understanding cultural nuance. And so that\'s something I really appreciate and really enjoy doing when I travel. So I\'m really appreciative that I got that experience firsthand. And I think it\'s hilarious that we were like, we\'re running on Mexican time. We have to be punctual, we have to be early. Especially on this vacation that me and my friend Ari have been very laid back with on time. This was the one time that we were like, it matters. And it doesn\'t matter just to us, but to other people in our itinerary.","I'm a young adult who doesn't drive but is lucky to live in a town with a very good bus system (for the US anyways). Today, I picked up some groceries using the bus to get back and forth and decided to grab some Starbucks while waiting for the bus to take me back home.

I immediately got so embarrassed by the idea of walking into Starbucks with a couple bags of groceries, that it would be disruptive and awkward. But I did it anyway! And it was fine!

Buses are meant to be used! Groceries are meant to be bought! It's not weird, I'm sure with the placement of the bus stop, coffee shop, and grocery store all being right next to each other, it happens often!

Social anxiety is so dumb.",5,1270,154
"I want to talk about the Great Floods of 2021. Yes. Okay. So basically, I live in Phoenix, and Phoenix is a desert, and we don\'t get a lot of rain for most of the year, except... Well, it\'s even worse than that with climate change. But previously, we would get these heavy monsoon seasons. So, July and August, it would rain really heavily. And because our soil isn\'t like other soils that soak up water really well, a lot of it\'s like hard, compact, and the water just tends to stay. So we have these things called flash floods. And they happen spontaneously when it rains a lot and it happens in different places. And so, several times in my life, there\'s been times where it would rain so, so hard that certain places would just be flooded. And one time it rained so hard when I was like in high school that our school day was canceled. And it\'s kind of funny to think, like, in a desert, it rains so hard in a desert, you get school canceled. But it\'s actually like a big thing. And so in 2021, we had just moved into this new house, or a new house to us. So it was my first time ever moving home in my life. So I was unfamiliar with kind of like what to expect in a new place. And it rained. Okay. So it was okay. So we moved in July, which is like the worst time to ever move in Phoenix because it\'s so hot. It\'s like 115 degrees, a lot of the year, a lot of the month. So, then moving when you\'re in and out, in and out is horrible. It sucks. And so we had just gone through that month of exhaustion of moving things, and then it being hot because we\'re trying to get used to the AC system. And then, suddenly, it started to rain really hard. It started to rain. Maybe, I think it was like the end of July. It was definitely still the summer. And it rained so, so hard that our backyard became a pond or like a mini Lake. And my dad had, because we were still moving, my dad had a bunch of stuff in the back, and the rain basically it was drowning in the water. And I thought I could save it. I was like, ""Don\'t worry, dad. I\'ll get your stuff."" My dad didn\'t care. I think he had just given up on the stuff from the exhaustion of moving. But I went outside with my rain jacket and then my shorts and my water shoes. And I was, like, pulling stuff. And then my sister joined me. But then my older sister yelled at both of us. And she was like, ""Get out of the water! You\'re going to get electrocuted!"" But it was funny. So, we took photos. The reason she said I was going to get electrocuted was because our home is like the corner of our house is the electrical unit of our neighborhood, so it\'s, like, not a street light, but it\'s the giant light poles, whatever, that run current. And we never had that in our yard before. In our old house, it was, like, in the alley. So the space between homes. But here, this is our first home where we had, like, wall to wall space with the house. So we had that power line in our backyard, and she was like, ""Get out, you\'ll get electrocuted!"" But I think it was funny because we had opened the doors and the windows, and you could just see our front yard was, like, a little mini river of all the water going downstream. And I also wanted to hang out in the water, and I forgot what I did. I think I made, like, a boat or something. I made something to try to float. But at some point, our backyard filled up so much that even our dogs, like our dogs, were looking at the ocean. And I have photos of our dogs sitting, gazing out into what was our lawn. And how is the ocean for them? And it was just so cute because my little dog was still alive back then. And she was just looking out into the abyss of water. And then I think it also became funny because, okay, in retrospect, it\'s funny, but when you\'re kind of going through it, you\'re kind of stressed. But the flooding, the water was rising really, really high up because we learned this later. So it turns out that our house was on an incline. And the fence we had was a wooden fence. So all the water that our neighbors had was swept down to us. And when we looked over to our neighbor\'s homes, it was dry. But we had all the water. So we collected all the water. So, later on, we, like a year or two later, we fixed this by having a brick wall to prevent that from happening. But because it was just, like, all following through, that\'s where all the water came, and it started to get into the house. And we started panicking and screaming, like, ""It\'s getting inside! It\'s getting inside!"" And we had never dealt with flooding before. So then I ran to grab all the towels we had. I started shoving it along the side, and then the pets didn\'t know what to do either. They were kind of useless. And it was also raining diagonally. So then, that\'s why the water was going into our living space. But finally, we were able to mop. Okay. But we were, like, rinsing the rags out and taking a lot of the water out, and it worked out. And the rain stopped. And Arizona\'s rain tends to gaslight you. Like, it would rain really hard. And then ten minutes after, it stops raining, it\'s like the water is gone. Nothing ever happened. All your fears of water and drowning were nonexistent at that point because the sun dried everything up. So that\'s kind of what happened. As soon as it stopped raining, the sun came out, and it kind of dried up all the rain. Rainy Spider song but just in a way quicker manner. And then, it\'s always funny to look back at all the photos because it\'s like, ""Wow, we really were out there in the water trying to save things that my dad didn\'t even care about."" And people, every time there\'s a flooding like that, people post random Snapchat, random social media posts of how people spent their time in the water. This water is gross, but people are still out there playing like I was. And so, I saw videos of people floating down the street in, like, an air mattress or tube. So people make the best out of the rain, although it\'s arguably dangerous because of the electrical current, like wiring. And then, if you\'re floating down a river in an air mattress, who\'s to say you\'re not going to run into a car that\'s, like, trying to also go through the water? The Floods of 2021 were a crazy time. And we learned from it to be more prepared for next time. And I think, and it hasn\'t rained that hard since. And having the brick wall helped a lot. So now the water doesn\'t go in as much.","We were climbing Annapurna, the eighth-highest mountain in the world, for two and a half months. And the last day going to the summit, the entire north face basically let loose. Three of my best friends of the eight were swept away and killed.

So, when I came back to Keystone to go back to work, you can't get away from it because you're interacting with your families and your kids. I was going to work every day and going through the motions, and after putting in ten years of work, I walked in and resigned.

I said, ""I'm gonna buy a sailboat and sail away."" So, I cashed out everything I had in my little house and finally sailed out under the Golden Gate Bridge on the left and didn't come back for a year and a quarter.

I was living in Costa Rica. If it's not working for you, move. Get out of there. If you don't feel good about it, get out of there. Every day is a wasted day after that.",4,1509,207
"Okay. So, I guess it's not so much of a story kind of, but I wanted to talk through some kind of feelings I've been feeling about the job hunt. I think it feels a little bit more magnified because today at work, the work at my bakery, I felt micromanaged. Yeah, I felt micromanaged by one of the workers. It's just a weird schedule. I'm supposed to be on my own, it's just two workers out of the four cake decorators. And because I'm new, the other one, I guess felt more inclined to try to help me, but I felt annoyed. I felt very micromanaged. And I guess it was just hard because she wanted me to speed up and go faster, but I don't want to, which I know it's like a bakery, fast-paced environment, but I'm like, I'm getting paid minimum wage. It can't be that serious. I don't get a bonus if I sell more. What's the incentive to really speed up, to not get fired? That doesn't seem like enough incentive for me to really try beyond the bare minimum. Yeah, especially like I don't have enough hours. So whatever. So I guess that experience today once again reminded me, like, I need to find another job. I mean, the worker didn't mean anything bad. Like, I really like her. I just think she was a little bit too on top of it. I guess it made me think more about the job hunt and how I've been very slow to apply to other jobs, where I can basically hire paying jobs that require a degree, white-collar jobs, whatever. So, yeah. It made me think about why it's going to take a while. And part of it has been like adjusting to change. Well, first it was, I don't know. I guess maybe I'm running out of excuses, and I think there's more to it than what I thought originally was making me stop. Because first it was like, oh, I had to get quick money, not quick money, but I had to have some source of income. I'm not going to be unemployed for much longer because I spent a lot of my money on travel. So first it was, get a quick job. Then it was like, learn this quick job so I can be comfortable and start applying on the side. And then I feel comfortable in it. But now, and then it was like, adjust to your little sister going to college. But then now I'm like, okay, what's the excuse for being very slow? And part of it was like me just trying to enjoy my time in Phoenix. Like my friends and family, just because I've always had a hard time or a hard relationship with the city or just like my place of birth. I don't know. I always had weird feelings about this city, and I never really felt like I belonged. Now it's like, oh, I'm actually building that sense of belonging, even though I've been here, like, a whole year later, because I worked remotely. I guess one reason why it's taking me so long in the job hunt is because I was trying to build community, and I was spending all my money going out. So kind of hard to find a balance. All my waiting time is going to going out and building community. And then the other part is I guess as I've been looking at browsing at jobs and besides the limitations of not having a driver's license, I'm trying to get creative with how I can swing it, probably just more remote roles. So it's just like a combination of things that discourage me, so not having a driver's license really does impact availability jobs in Phoenix or where I can get around if I don't always have a secure ride and I don't always want to be paying Ubers and lifts. And then another part is like, I guess this is a part. I guess I've been realizing more that the job hunt started to get like a little bit emotional. But the job hunt makes me frustrated of thinking about my last job because I was with the company for three years. And then I turned full time in October. And I mentioned my salary previously. It was wrong. So I was making more than that. But it was like my first big paying paycheck out of college. I don't know. So I just feel like doing the job search makes me feel frustrated because I really feel cheated. I really feel like my last company really sucked. And I don't know how to grapple with those feelings because they do good work. And I always knew I wasn't going to stay long at that company. I just feel like I got such a short end of the stick, and it really sucks because I feel like I'm just a recent college grad, and I feel like I don't know. So the company really pushes on Hispanic, Latino people, like breaking through barriers, going to higher up positions in their company, so it's very marketed with Hispanic, Latino identity and roles outside of service and outside of like I guess I don't know. It's very professional, like white-collar outlook for Latinos and Hispanic people. So I guess. I just feel cheated because the mission is really valuable for what we were working with in our companies, and it was key on mentorship and networking. So it's like I learned so much from that job and. I guess I wish I could have left when I was still on good terms with everyone. I think for the most part I am, but I think my view of them is all tainted. Like one of the coworkers. I think her specifically, she's really gotten under my skin. I think the job relates to me still having mixed feelings about my last job because it's just so crazy. I keep reading all these job descriptions and thinking like, wow, my company didn't have any benefits. We had a birthday bonus or like a week between New Year's and Christmas off, but we didn't have health care. We didn't really have. We had unlimited PTO, but that kind of was a scam. And I always got criticism for taking time off and then I guess I'm just worried like, what if my next job. I don't suss up the red flags. I don't suss them out beforehand and I just walk into another mess. I'm really worried about that. But then I know I'll just quit. I'll just keep applying for jobs until I can trust it. But this job is so agonizing. I didn't realize how much emotion is behind it. And I guess that's what I'm working through. It's just like seeing all these job descriptions making me realize like, wow, my last company was like, they didn't really have any benefits. And then I felt so judged. And I felt like, especially towards the end, they really just gave me a bunch. They gave me things to do and didn't really train me on it. And they had all these, specifically, my boss. I think this is targeted towards my boss and my coworker who's my arch-nemesis now because I feel like both of them put all this pressure on me and didn't really adequately train me. And also, the coworker kind of low-key sabotaged me or tries to sabotage me, and she was really good at it. She was really good at trying to sabotage me. So I guess I'm just worried about all the mind games I have to play at the next role. And just really feeling like, wow, I could have gotten a whole year of experience with them, or I could have had more marketable skills if I had stayed there longer if I was able to stay longer. But I really felt, I guess bullied in a way and really left out and really. Yeah. I feel like my boss kept saying things that made me feel like I wasn't doing a good enough job. But then when I spoke to other people I worked with, they were like other people who aren't directly in the company. They made it so that. They made it sound like I was doing a great job, and I was going above and beyond. So I'm just kind of so disappointed that. The people that I got close to or at least my core team, I feel like towards the end, I just felt so mistreated by them and not this job. And then one of the reasons I guess I have a hard time filling out applications is because I just get wrapped up in the emotion behind it. I don't know. Reading job descriptions, I'm like, damn, I was cheated. I didn't even get a job offer letter. Who the fuck doesn't give their employee a job offer letter? I had to advocate for that, and I had to write my own job description, like I had to do so much for myself. And I'm like, but they're not even skilled, and I don't feel adequate enough to really market myself for these applications. I mean, I'll probably just be like, yeah, I did it. And exaggerate my skills, but I really feel like they failed me. And I haven't gotten over it. I'm kind of frustrated that I haven't gotten over it because it's been months. And you would think traveling around Europe would cure your problem. You would think having the privilege of travel to escape your problems would actually help you address stuff","So, I work for a cleaning company and clean buildings by myself, no biggie. I enjoy being by myself anyways. He lives three hours away. I put in my two weeks' notice Friday. He messaged me today on Sunday. He always ghosts me, takes days to respond to me, and it's just unprofessional. He wanted me to ask around and see if anyone would be interested, so I made a social media post and got responses immediately and gave him his number. He messaged me a minute ago over something different, and I casually asked him if he got any messages for the position. He responded, ""Yes, but I'm not working. I'm off today, of course.""

Yeah, I know he's off, and I'm supposed to be off too, but here I am dealing with people interested, pointing them his way, and pretty much doing all the work. I'm not even getting paid for helping him find potential employees, so I'm going to just quit responding to people.

I've been through so much with this cleaning company. I got reported over some rooms not being cleaned, which was not my fault because my key card didn't give me access to those rooms until the end of July. I've been working since April. I tried to miss work the other day due to a stomach virus, and he wouldn't let me, afraid I'd get reported again because that would make him look bad.

I tried to miss a week because my grandpa had a heart attack, and he wouldn't let me take care of him and got upset about me missing work just for four days.

I'm so excited for this new job where I'll be working with children. The pay is higher too.",4,1918,348
"Okay, so I guess I\'m going to talk about risk and the risk I take in my life. And I\'ve been wondering, what\'s the next step? And I always consider myself not a big risk-taker. I\'ve always considered myself someone who plays it safe all the time, who chooses the safest option and just security, just because I struggled to find that in my childhood and growing up. So I guess I made that, like, I don\'t know.\n\nI always just search for stability. But when I think back on my life and major changes I\'ve made, it\'s all been because I\'ve taken risks. And I guess that\'s a little scary. And I\'m wondering where that leaves me now that I\'m in this weird spot in my life where I\'m in between careers and trying to get my footing back in Phoenix. And learning new skills at the same time. So I guess that\'s what I\'ve been thinking about.\n\nThe first risk I took, if I could trace it back, was moving - transferring schools. I wanted to transfer to a school in my neighborhood that supposedly had better education compared to other schools. So I guess that was the first risk that I took. I made the initiative and encouraged my parents to take it on my behalf. It was when I was around nine or eight. And that was hard because moving schools was hard. I felt dumb at that school. I had a lot of imposter syndrome because I felt like it was much more advanced than what I knew, even though I was technically a very smart kid growing up. But then I adapted and made friends. It\'s funny to think that the friends I have now in Phoenix, that I\'m really close to, all kind of came from that elementary school experience, from fourth to eighth grade. So I think it\'s funny that that was the first risk I considered taking.\n\nAnd then another risk I guess I\'ve taken was changing schools again. I think the risks I\'ve taken have just been changes of environments. So I changed schools again in high school because the first school I went to was a complete culture shock. It was a predominantly white school, upper middle class or upper-class backer, on a different side of Phoenix. So it felt weird trying to adjust to that. And I felt like the coursework was weird, and I didn\'t feel challenged. So then I went to this internationally rigorous school. I decided to move to the internationally rigorous school, and then I had to make friends again. Maybe some things don\'t work out the way you want them to, because I felt like I had no life. Okay, I kind of did. I hung out a lot, like I had a lot of good friends for the time. Friends that got me through college, I mean, fucking school.\n\nAnd then I took another risk when I went to Alaska for a summer. I was offered an opportunity to go to Alaska, and I was like, yeah, fuck it, I want to go because I\'m from Arizona. What the fuck do I know about oceans and mountains of snow? So I went, and that kind of sucked a lot. I liked the nature and the exploration part of it, and I liked learning new skills. But I had a really hard time with the group I was with, the pod I was supposed to be with all the time. They were very negative, very picky eaters, and they were expecting Alaska to be a vacation. I was like, ""Y\'all, what part of shitting in the woods made you think that we were going to be at a five-star hotel?"" I don\'t understand what happened there. It was a really hard time because I couldn\'t escape them. They were my main group, and even when I switched, I was still kind of stuck with all of them. So I guess another risk that didn\'t work out in my favor. But it made me learn more about how to deal with people who have different viewpoints in terms of food or in terms of what we were expecting out of the experience.\n\nAnd then I guess another risk was when I went to university far away from home as the first person in my family to go to college. And I was like, I need to escape, I need a change of environment. And I got it. It wasn\'t paid for fully. I had a lot to make up, but I constantly applied for scholarships to make sure I could afford to go to that school. So ultimately, I got it paid off - almost a full ride. I want to say like, 95% of my schooling was paid. So that was another risk I took.\n\nSo I guess a lot of the risks in my life have been just changing environments. Because there was little to no hope in studying abroad, but at the last minute on the last application date, I decided to go to Greece during the pandemic, like the height of the pandemic, because I really wanted to live abroad. And I was like, it\'s probably now or never. And that also didn\'t work out. It didn\'t work out the way I wanted it to. I wanted it to be more fun and exciting in a fun way. But it was exciting in a stressful way because what was I expecting? The pandemic resources were scarce. Greek people didn\'t even want us there because they were like, ""You\'re using up our resources,"" which is very valid. But I realized that at the time, I was just like, I want to change my environment. If I\'m going to be stuck in my room, I might as well be stuck in my room in Athens.\n\nAnd then another risk was also going to Denmark because I didn\'t know how it was going to work out with my degree. But I was like, I really, really want to go abroad. I want to keep living abroad and experiencing different ways of life and incorporating that into mine. So I went, and that was a lot better. Denmark was actually one of the safest risks I\'ve taken, one of the risks that took that came out the best way possible.\n\nCome on, Elvis. So that was actually one of the better risks that worked out where I got to learn, make new friends. But then it was really hard towards the end because of certain accidents that happened and people that died. But it worked out for the most part.\n\nAnd then I find myself in the latest mini-risk. I\'m still getting over my trauma with my last job, my last full-time job. It took a lot of energy and peace of mind from me, and I knew it was risky going into it. I went still because I was like, what other job offers do I have? And I just wanted money. I was just like, I want to graduate and I want to have money. I don\'t want to work through this whole stressful process. I don\'t want to relocate. I was tired of constantly changing locations. So I guess now, and then, I guess the irony. I\'m kind of like, how do I take a risk without always changing locations? I can\'t just keep moving and not running away from problems but running towards problems in a different location. Hey, don\'t do that.\n\nSo I guess whatever risk means in the context of staying in the same space for a long time. Because now I quit that job without a backup plan. Well, my backup plan was to travel. My plan was to quit this job, travel for a couple of months, come home, apply for a part-time job while I get my footing again. And that\'s exactly what I\'m doing. So I take these risks, but I take them with plans that I have in mind. But now I\'m in that weird spot where I\'m like, well, I\'m doing according to a plan. What do I do now? Or do I want to take another risk? Or do I just want to play it safe? I have this bakery job, but it doesn\'t pay well at all for the dreams I have and the hopes and the degree I have.\n\nYeah, just wondering, what does taking risk mean now that I\'m in one spot? And I see myself in the city for the next couple of years while I build up savings and build up a safety net, so that when I do leave, I can mitigate necessary risks.","I got jumped into a gang. And I was either gonna end up pregnant or in jail or dead, or I was gonna be able to change my life. So my sister one day, she begged me and begged me. She goes, ""Come to this photography class that they're having for the summer.""

So I started with the photography class. I was so happy with what I was doing that I didn't have time to be miserable on the street or miserable drinking or miserable going in a downward spiral. I had purpose.

They made me feel like me being there was very significant, that if I wasn't here, it was gonna be different. I struggle to this day, and this is why I push school to kids. I said, ""Do what you gotta do so that when you're ready to do what you wanna do, you're able to.""",3,1650,181
"I don't know if it's really well, I don't really have a story in mind. I think I'm just kind of like, have a lot of anxiety involving the job search or I guess, more shame around it. Because I guess is what I had to talk out. So a coworker of mine from my last job, and there's only, like, three of them, three coworkers, so one of them reached out and was like, hey, how are you doing? Oh, yeah. He wished me happy birthday. I was like. That was a while ago, but anyways, so I guess he reached out was like we should catch up. And I guess since I got that message, it kind of just been ashamed or embarrassed about my job search. Because I left that job in April. I was just done. Now that I think back about it, I feel like it couldn't be handled the resignation better instead of just setting a resignation letter to my boss. Well, I think I did pretty good given the circumstances and how I was in the moment. So I guess I'm just, like, embarrassed that I left the job in April. And now it's October, and I'm working at a bakery in a grocery store. So I think I carry a lot of shame around my lack of professional occupation. Especially because a lot of people. Have I guess I've internalized the idea that I'm meant for something great. I think a lot of people in my life, well, I know for sure a lot of people in my life have always told me that. I'm destined for something great, that I'm meant to do something good in the world. I've been hearing this since I was young. And I guess it's like, and even my last job. Like my boss would have to say, like I'm meant to do such greater things. So I guess it's like I'm feeling the weird pressure of. Being constantly told my whole life that I'm going to achieve greatness and then having this low period in my life right now, where I'm like, okay, well, I was able to travel a lot and I met really cool people, had really cool experiences. But then now coming back to reality, working a minimum wage job or minimum wage? Isn't livable. They're cutting my hours. The cost of living is crazy. Everything's increasing in prices, my family can't really make more money. We're barely getting by. So I guess his comment, just this comment. He generally probably just wants to catch up. And he's been very supportive of my growth. And I guess I'm just embarrassed to think, like, wow, I quit this job months ago, and yet I'm stuck in a minimum wage job, working more hours for less money than when I worked over there. So yeah. I don't know what to make of it right now. So yeah. So I guess I'm just dealing with those feelings of, like, embarrassment. Especially knowing that I graduated. With such a prestigious University, and that's kind of shoved down my throat. I just remember being in Korea and meeting my friend's Korean friend's family. And them just at least especially the Korean friend talking up my school. And they're like, she went to such a really good school. And I was like, oh, my God. I'm like I graduated. Well, but at what cost. And I don't know. I feel like I have all these expectations of my future being great. And right now I don't feel like I'm professionally living up to it, but I am doing better in terms of sense of community and enjoying hobbies and free time. So I'm growing in other ways and reconnecting and things that I missed through the pandemic and through whatever shitshow was last year. But I feel kind of like, wow. Here I am, three months into a job I gave myself the five-month deadline. I was like, when I come back, it's going to take five to eight months to find a full-time job and I just have to have a job in the meantime. I don't know. I just feel me. So yeah, I ashamed, embarrassed, and just kind of, like, disappointed the reality of life and how expensive everything was. And I wish I was born rich, and I wish I was a neffle baby. Instead, I have to forge all these connections on my own because. I don't have family ties to extreme wealth. But whatever, I guess.","I knew I wanted to go to college but didn't know how I was gonna get there. I had a very supportive family, but financially, we didn't have any money tucked away. Fortunately, I was able to get a scholarship to a college. I got my Bachelor's degree in communication. Out of college, I did sales for a number of years, just kind of trying to find my way. 

My wife was a student at Wayne Community College, and they had an opportunity, an opening on the phones. One day, the chancellor of the college was on the other end, and I had no clue. I was just excited to be answering phones for the college. He wanted to meet me, and I had opportunities to advance from there. 

Now, I am the associate vice chancellor for students services. So, I tell everybody, ""I'm not supposed to be here, statistically speaking. I'm a black male and I grew up in Detroit with all the gang violence, with all the drug violence."" 

Don't be defined by the neighborhoods that you came from. Don't be defined by whether or not you're a first-generation college student, whether you're a minority. Whatever that is, you can go and do and be whoever you wanna be.",5,924,256
"Or, wait, is he too loud? Okay, so, my story... I guess I just wanted to talk briefly about my driving experience. So, I previously have driven throughout the years, just not well. I've always had a challenge driving. I think it was mostly the lack of desire to drive. So, I've always had smaller experiences here and there, but I never went on the main road. So, I finally decided I just need to pay for driving school. I figure, if I put money into it, that's going to force me to have to do it and get my license because as I'm doing my job search, a lot of jobs I'm looking at are requiring an Arizona driver's license. So, I figured I just need it. I don't have to use it necessarily. So, the courses I paid for are four courses and let me see if I can recall the courses I paid for. My last lesson, I basically get tested and if I get 80% or higher, I get my license which I actually feel confident about because today I was driving on the main roads and I was maintaining a conversation with the driving instructor. So, I feel like that was already multitasking. And just from the preliminary grade that she gave me, I got a 60%. I didn't even know she was grading me. So, I feel like if, on my first lesson, I got a 60%, I should be able to do well next time. So, I'm on track to get my license and next time I get to do the freeway. So, yeah, I'm reaching my goals little by little.","I took auto-shop in high school. And I loved it. I knew I was gonna be somewhere. I knew I wanted to race cars. I got out of high school, and I went to work for a Dodson dealership. I started delivering parts for the parts department at the Dodson dealership. And while I was racing and taking cars apart, restoring cars, racing, all of that, I couldn't get enough of it.

I went on to the import car and parts business. I bought and sold a few companies over that time. I ran a few companies. And here I am 44 years later, running the SEMA Garage.

Along the way, I had lots of struggles, sure. Everything from racing and crashing or blowing up engines. You've got to just keep trying. You can't let things let you down.

When we were building this Maverick, we got about three quarters of the way through the project. You get to a point where you're laying awake late at night, saying, is this thing ever going to get done? And you really just got to wake up every morning and push through it, and say, I'm not gonna let these things get in my way. You're gonna fail. But you're gonna pick yourself up and keep going.",3,335,259
"Okay. So it\'s not really a happy story to tell right now, but I guess I\'ve just been feeling a little overwhelmed. With the current situation, Israel and Palestine in terms of the current war that Israel is waging on Palestine. Yeah, I guess I just wanted to talk about the overall lack of sense of power that I have, which is... I don\'t know. I just feel like I have such little power to do any change and it kind of really just sucks. I feel like the situation just overall really sucks because when I came to the war in Ukraine and Russia, everyone was on the side of Ukraine. They\'re like, ""Okay, defend your land. Protect yourself. Your heritage."" Vladimir Putin is like the obvious... like the villain. It was very like media always can support of Ukraine, so many countries with Puerto, Ukraine and their sovereignty. And then when it comes to Israel and Palestine, I feel like a sense of loss. I don\'t know, like a mind warp. Because media is sharing one side of the story. So like news, popular news outlets are showing how vulnerable Israel is and how they\'re the victim. But then what you\'ll see on the ground, like a lot of social media, I follow in Palestine and have been following for years. I didn\'t really note too much about Palestine and Israel, but I knew a little bit because I was already following creators that talked about the Palestinian cause. And I guess I\'m just... like baffled at how the media paints one picture of Israel, and then the underground roots of people who are talking and organizing show a completely different side of the story. They definitely show like Palestinians are the vulnerable population. They\'re the ones who like hospitals are being bombed with civilians are being hurt. I guess I\'m just trying to grapple with the mind fuck of it all of Western media showing Israel as like they\'re the ones defending themselves as retaliation. But... it\'s an overkill like in the literal sense. Israel has just been bombing Gaza. Nonstop. And the people there have no refuge from it. And the fact that Israel is actually committing war crimes, like bombing hospitals, bombing safe zones, cutting off power supplies. I guess the final final straw for me where I\'m like, ""Oh my God, I guess..."" The final point of despair. Like I was already slowly sinking into the form of despair. Of, like, ""Wow. Israel is bombing hospitals like they\'re not letting humanitarian aid in."" It was like all these... big things Israel was doing that were like little stabs in my heart, I don\'t know, or like in my sanity I don\'t know. I already felt the pain little by little, and I\'m very detached from it like I don\'t have much emotional connection to the region or to its unique problems. But... the more and more I kept hearing about things happening with Israel, the more I was like, ""Oh my God, this is bad."" But I think the final final straw, where I\'m literally like, ""Yeah, I need to be calling representatives. I need to be emailing and sending letters."" The final drive for me was that Israel completely bombed and decimated service to the area. So now, like Palestinians and people in Gaza, or at least people in Gaza literally cannot call anyone like they can\'t call. They can\'t text. They have no access to Internet. Like all the news outlets reporting from there have no cell service. I don\'t know how it happened. And I think that\'s the final straw for me where I\'m like, ""You literally cut off the last source of communication we have to people on the ground, people who are worrying about their families, people who are worrying about their friends. And these are war crimes. And I just feel like baffled, like we\'re not doing anything about it. The international community is completely failing people in Gaza. It is such a stark contrast from what was happening in Ukraine, how people were sending money in Ukraine, people were like, ""I\'ll host you. I\'ll give you refuge in my home."" And it\'s like, the complete opposite. And I really don\'t understand how or why. I\'m just baffled. I\'m also like, yeah, I think people see this as like a righteous religious war to some extent, like some people, I think. I don\'t know, that\'s like my very limited take on it. That people see as like, ""Oh, Israel, Christianity versus Muslims."" And then I don\'t know. I feel like that\'s to some extent, some of the comments I\'ve seen, but I\'m just like, how are we okay with this super powerful country or, now in the comparison like super powerful country completely obliterating another one. How are we as a society okay when someone who holds so much power is okay to take it out on someone who holds so little, like a big guy beating up a little kid. Like how? I\'m just, like, amazed. I don\'t know, amazed. Just baffled that we\'re okay with this. And there\'s really nothing I can do because like the US backs Israel. So I feel like I have no power. I\'m one person, one person who doesn\'t have money. I don\'t have power. I don\'t have money. I don\'t have influence. First Gen in this country. I have almost nothing to my name. What power do I really have to help in this fight? I\'m at a loss. And the most I can do is share posts on social media, and even then, that makes me a little anxious about... the amount of common people have. But I just repost a couple of things here and there. But I\'m like, what good is it? Or like, I try to talk to my parents or to people around me. Let them know, like, this is the other side. Yeah, the media. Western media... is painting it this way. But these are like actual videos and testimonies I\'ve seen from people on the ground. I just feel so helpless, helpless, and hopeless. And it\'s such a complete, stark contrast from Ukraine and Russia. Like so huge. I don\'t even know what to do with this information. And I guess like a part of it, because I feel like I think when it comes to me, whenever I worry about something bigger than myself, it\'s usually... Like a sign of some insecurity. No. Okay. I get you. Like, okay. I realized that whenever I\'m nervous or scared about something way bigger than myself, it\'s usually a reflection of a vulnerability or insecurity I have of myself. In relation to myself. And I think I just come to realize that the US doesn\'t care about its citizens. It doesn\'t care about... I hate think about money and I already knew that. But this is another example where I\'m like, wow, I am a citizen of this country. I\'m paying taxes to this country. I want the best for the people in the country. But the reality is the government, the establishment, people who have power and money don\'t care about me. They don\'t care about people who don\'t have power, who don\'t have influence. They don\'t have money. They don\'t care about... its citizens. It just cares about the bottom line and the profit. I keep thinking about the hostages in Gaza who can\'t leave. I guess Israel too. I don\'t know about that. I don\'t know what the fuck Israel is doing, but I just keep thinking about American citizens and residents stuck in Gaza, and like me growing up and being told that American passport, so powerful, so privileged, like the US people don\'t mess with Americans abroad or anything. Because yeah, because it\'s like the US will get involved. And I\'m like, this is such bullshit. Like I was just fed lies. Growing up. The US isn\'t too shit for its citizens when it comes down to money. Or like when it comes down to money and prestige versus the safety of a people, the institutions don\'t give a fuck. So... Yeah. So I guess I\'m just like, these are all the feelings I\'m grappling with. I have so little power in comparison to this giant ass award as being waged. People don\'t give a shit about minorities. I don\'t know, like non-white minorities. Non-White citizens. People, residents. And that the State truly does not care for your well-being. At least the US doesn\'t. So I guess it just makes me hopeless. So yeah, that\'s what I\'ve been grappling with the last couple of days, weeks. And I don\'t know what to do with this.","I got shot in June 2007. I took a bullet side-to-side through the knee on a house raid, so it basically blew my knee out. Everything that I wanted to do or I wanted to be revolved around being a soldier. So I struggled. 

What do you see most on social media and on the news? You see PTSD, suicide, all these veterans struggling, that's the trendy story. But we need to change that rhetoric. 

Instead of talking about all these bad things, talk about the positive things, the things that we learn, that we are capable of, that make us great. Instead of cowering from challenges, we learn to face our fears, we learn to face those obstacles, and so use those things we learned in the military to not just live in the civilian world but thrive.",3,1752,160
"Okay. So, the story is how I got really interested in the intersection of science and computer graphics. I had been interested in both of these topics for a long time. I wasn't really sure how they went together for a professional career. But I was in grad school, and I was taking a class on biochemistry and plant metabolism. And we had a chance to write a paper. And the paper was supposed to be about a process, a biochemical process that takes place in plants. And I asked the professor if instead of a paper, I could do an animation on a process. I thought it might be more engaging, more interesting, maybe a way to bring that process to life. And he agreed to it. So, I set out to find a process. I found something nice. I worked on it. I used a variety of computer graphics tools and ended up with an animation that I thought explained the process really well. And then I turned that in as my project instead of a paper, and I had a chance to present that to students. And the students really enjoyed it. They learned a lot from the process, being able to watch it happen as a cycle. And I thought it was a really good example of how science and graphics can come together for an educational purpose.","I decided I wanted to try this new field called biomedical engineering, which my dad had encouraged me to explore. I was in college, and I was taking classes. I had to figure out what to do for the summer, and I was walking by this lab. On the door of the lab, it said artificial organs. That sounded really cool to me because it was a mix of biomaterials and engineering, and it was very applied. I could understand why you would wanna do nerve regeneration.

The third summer was when I finally found the right interface for me. We've invented nanosensors that you can inject that can roam around your body looking for disease and then emit a signal in the urine. Our long-term vision is that this could help with cancer detection in resource-poor settings.

One of the biggest roadblocks was internal. I certainly had imposter syndrome. I was always worried I didn't belong at the table, that somehow I'd been some fluke of admission, and it was only a matter of time before people found me out. In fact, it's that uniqueness that makes you different, what makes you valuable.",3,260,221
"Okay. So the story is from when I was a little kid, and my dad would take me fishing, so we would go in a boat out on the lake to catch fish. And because I was a little kid, I didn\'t like to wake up early, not that I do now, but I didn\'t want to wake up really early in the morning and leave before the sun came up. And I got tired of sitting out in the hot sun and not catching anything, not having any fun. And so I would complain a lot, and that\'s hard for an adult to listen to, a little kid complain a lot. And I said, ""I was bored,"" and I wasn\'t catching anything, and I kind of gave up. And my dad told me that you won\'t catch anything unless you have your bait in the water, which is true. So he was trying to say, like, you\'ll have more fun if you keep working hard. But as a kid, it didn\'t really resonate with me, but many years later, as an adult, that saying has stuck with me. And I\'ve taken it as more of a metaphor. And the idea is that if you don\'t try, you can\'t really succeed. So you have to try. So I think it\'s a nice memory. At the time, I didn\'t really like to listen to what he had to say because I was bored and I wanted to go home and play and watch cartoons and stuff. But it\'s an important memory and it reminds me that in order to have success, you have to keep trying.","I have been going to baseball games for a long time. I used to bring my glove in hopes I would catch a foul ball, but once I got to a certain age, adulthood, I gave up. But still wanted to catch one, just to say I did. 

I went to a game with friends, it was pretty empty in the stands, but it was a nice day for a ballgame. Somewhere in the sixth or seventh inning, after I had gotten a beer, a player lofted a high foul ball that made me jump up because it was close to me. I ran over a few steps with the beer still in my hand, but the ball was going to come up short. But then it bounced off the concrete, off a railing, and right into my chest. 

It dropped to the ground, and I quickly grabbed it. Unfortunately, I did not mention as it hit me, it caused my beer to spill all over my shirt, practically soaking it. But I had the foul ball. 

But once I had it in my hand, I realized it wasn't that important. So I found a kid with a glove and handed it to him, and he was so happy. I spent the rest of the game talking with him and his family. I felt like I made a new friend. 

So the price of a beer, a smelled-soaked shirt, I learned a life lesson. It's not always what you catch; it's what you do with it that makes a difference.",3,318,299
"Okay. So this story is about a time that I was recruiting someone to do an educational video with me. I wanted to create videos about math and science that could be used for teacher professional development. And I was looking for participants. And when I was out one night, I went to like an art show. And I found a guy selling handcrafted metal goods, like belt buckles and stuff. And I asked him if he might be willing to talk about the math and science of that process. And he said he's actually a motorcycle mechanic. And I said, wow, that's interesting. Maybe we can do a video about that. Maybe about the math of motorcycles somehow. And he said, I don't really do math. And I thought that was maybe unusual because I assumed he did somehow. And I said, well, what do you like to do with motorcycles? And he told me that he liked to make them go fast. And I said, well, how do you do that? And he said, well, one way that I do that is by adjusting the power curve or the torque of the engine. And I thought to myself, well, that's physics and that's math. And then he said he likes to maybe increase the volume of the cylinders inside the engine. And I thought, well, that's geometry. And then he talked to me about how different grades of fuel, like different octane of gasoline, has an effect on the performance of the engine. And I said, well, that's chemistry and math as well. So I thought to myself this whole time that he does use math, but he just doesn't think about it in that way. So I was able to convince him to do a movie. And we did one. And he ended up talking about some of these ideas on camera and then we were able to link that discussion to math education standards and then present that to teachers. And so it ended up being a successful video. And one of my important memories of that project.","When I was a kid growing up, we had a wrecking yard. So you're naturally tied into it, and of course, we always had the old circle trap cars and stuff, so we've always been interested in those. Then I got into drag racing. Getting into the mechanical end of things was a very strong deal because I wanted to be a pilot. And Vietnam was going real strong when I got out of high school. So I wanted to get a commission and fly.

I had a heart arrhythmia, so they wouldn't let me do that. So if I couldn't fly, I thought, ""Well, I'll work on them."" That was a big struggle for me, not being able to pursue that end of it. But I guess I don't miss that because not a day goes by, even with this equipment out here, that I don't use stuff that I actually learned back then.

Regardless of where you learn it, once you learn it, it's there. And if you're fortunate enough to retain your memory for a while, based on the fact that I have been around this industry for a long time, and I've been an aircraft mechanic for over 40 years, if you can learn the theory of mechanics, you can do anything.

Whether you're working on diesel engines and heavy equipment, whether you're working on high-performance cars, or whether you're working on your own car, what you wanna do is pursue and learn everything you can about it because one day you're gonna need it.",2,408,310
"So, this is relatively short, but in about maybe a year ago, as a family, we finally took my mom on a wish list vacation to the Grand Canyon. My brother and sister and I decided that it was a good time, and there was something that she had really been wanting to do for a long time. And we're all growing up now, so it's hard to get everybody together. But I did a lot of planning and got it worked out. Everyone got flights, and we all met up and flew out there and did it. We got a car, rented that, drove around, saw some really interesting sights along the way. Finally made it to the Grand Canyon, did a little bit of light hiking, and it was a really great trip for the family.","I recently went to Mexico for my 25th birthday. It was exciting because I haven't been there before, and it was a chance to get a group of my friends together. We spent 4 days over there, and we had events planned every day. It was busy but definitely a lot of fun.

The first night, we just relaxed at the resort. The second day we went zip-lining, which was extremely fun. We also went to a cenote.

The last day, we went on a catamaran to Isla Mujeres, which was breathtaking. Being on that boat and looking at the view was incredible. My most memorable moment was definitely when the tour guide danced around on the catamaran and poured us drinks. It was a lot of fun, and I felt relaxed.

The view was phenomenal, and just being with my friends was great. The sea was super blue, and it was breathtaking.

The whole trip, we ate to our hearts' content. It was great food, and all of the drinks we could have. It was one of my best trips, and I will definitely remember it for a while.",2,159,220
"Okay. So this trip is from the United States to Brazil. The story is, I was working in a science lab and had a lot of opportunities to work with international colleagues. Generally, they were from India, China, South America, and specifically, Brazil. What really happened was, I just was working with these colleagues and we became friends. And at one point, some friends of mine offered me an opportunity to travel back home with them over a winter break. So, I talked with them about it and I talked to some other friends that were also going to Brazil, to a different city. And, I had gotten it all worked out and I flew down there and met up with one group, one family. And then hung out with them a little bit, went to the beach and that was really great. And then I took an internal flight to another city and met up with my other friends. And then hung out with them for a while and had a good time there as well. And then at the end of the break, I flew back. But overall, it was a wonderful trip, a great experience, trying new foods, meeting new people, and experiencing that different culture. So, yeah, I had a great time.","When I was in my investment banking job, I was thinking about where I'm gonna go on my next vacation. Because now I actually had the money to travel and I had some vacation days. All my friends, my colleagues started coming to know me as the travel desk. I was doing that at work and with my friends, and some of them said, hey, why don't you just start a blog? So I started writing about my own travels, and that's the blog that seven years later, I'm doing this full time now.

As I was writing about different restaurants, especially ethnic restaurants, in Atlanta, I wanted to know the background of them. That's why I started traveling there. I would meet locals, go to their homes, take cooking classes, and learn more about the origin of those cuisines and then come back and have a different take on it.

I've been to about 75 countries, and I only speak three languages. I think you have to be just very humble and open-minded. If you're more accepting, people will just open up, even if you don't understand the language.",2,251,226
"So, I have a story about one of my pets that I had as a child. So, I think I was in high school when I got a hamster. And hamsters are really small. And they're fast. But they're little. And the story is about one night. The story is about one night where I had gone to sleep but the lock on the cage door was apparently not completely locked. And my hamster escaped during the night while I was asleep. So, it's important to know, my bedroom was on the opposite end of the house from where my parents were. So, during the night, unknown to me, my hamster found a way out and then somehow got out of the cage. Dropped off of a dresser where he was, so about a meter or so, and then he had crawled through the house somehow and had escaped the attention of our dog and ended up in my parents' bedroom. On my mom, tickling her chin with his nose in the middle of the night. And she woke up and found him and then was very surprised. And she brought him back to my room and locked him in the cage and told me about it the next morning. But, we all thought that was very funny, that he had escaped and then crawled all the way across the entire house to get to my mom and then crawled up on the bed to get to her and then woke her up by tickling her chin. Now they liked each other. They had a good relationship. So, we just thought that was funny.","I used to own pet rats as a kid, but as an adult, I haven't had the ability to do so. We got two into the shelter, and I ended up adopting one of them (they had to be separated as they were fighting, but I do plan to get him a friend). He is so sweet and friendly and loves to snuggle and groom me! He's just amazing.

He's brought me so much joy in just the two weeks I've owned him. We snuggle almost every night as I sit and play video games and wind down after work. He's just an amazing little creature, and I never would have imagined the joy he'd have brought me even just a month ago.

He's so amazing!",3,309,148
"Okay. So, this story is another story about a pet, and this one at the time, I was dating this girl. And she had a dog, and we both enjoyed playing with this dog. She was really nice. And one thing that was really memorable for me was when we would take her to a park and let her off the leash. And then we would play hide and go seek with her. So, typically what would happen is one of us would hold the dog on the ground. She was seated, but we would cover her eyes with our hands so she couldn\'t see. And then the other one would run and hide behind the tree somewhere far away. And then when they were well hidden, whoever was holding the dog would let her see and then ask questions like, ""Where is she? Where did she go?"" Something like that just to get the dog excited. And then the dog would look around and not know where the person was, and then she would get excited and she would go into a hunting mode. And then she would start sniffing around on the ground and looking around and trying to check everything. And then when she finally found the other person, she would get really excited. And then the other person would laugh and get her all worked up. And then it would be really happy, and then she would run back really excited. And we would do it again, just changing roles. But it was a really fun moment and it was an enjoyable memory.","About two weeks ago, I adopted a new cat. I go to a local pet store once a week or once every two weeks to buy supplies for my animals. I often take my husband to the pet store with me so that he can carry the heavier items that I purchase.

At the back of the pet store, there is a small room that has a big window so people can see in. Inside the room are several cages where cats are kept that are available for adoption. Several months ago, my husband noticed an orange cat with the name Ivan in one of the cages, and he seemed to really like him.

Week after week, I would go to the pet store and pass by this room. I could not help but notice that while many of the other cages were filled with different cats each week, Ivan never moved. He just sat in his small cage waiting to be adopted. The store lowered his adoption fee several times but still, no one wanted Ivan. It made me very sad to see him sitting there, so on the next trip to the pet store, I took my husband again.

I showed him that Ivan was still there and asked an employee to let him meet the lonely cat. It was instant love. Ivan almost jumped into my husband's arms and purred. It was like he knew they were going to be together. I signed some paperwork and bought a few new toys while they got acquainted.

My husband's eyes lit up when I came back with a box to take Ivan home in. When we got home, Ivan seemed comfortable, like he had always been there.",3,300,319
"So this story is about me moving across the country, from Florida to Massachusetts, with my girlfriend. And we had to bring two rabbits. So, I had never done that before. I had moved across the country before, but not with another person and not with two rabbits. Especially, so that was kind of an interesting challenge.\n\nRabbits are not the kind of animal that you need to take outside to go to the bathroom. They can stay in their little cages, but we had to have them in these small cages for car transport. And then the funny thing, the story is that we stayed at a variety of hotels and places like that on the way because we were driving. But not all of them were open to pets.\n\nBut rabbits are not your typical cat or dog because they stay in a cage, and not a lot of people have rabbits. But I remember just the challenges of having to get to the hotel and then moving the rabbits into the space. And I remember staying at this one sort of roadside bed and breakfast-type place, and we had to move the rabbits inside. But once they were in, we were able to let them out and run around. And they played a little bit. And that was fun, but it was just a unique challenge to me to move across country with these two small pets and then facing the challenges of meeting their needs as well as ours as we did this.\n\nAnd one time we tried to sneak them into a hotel because the hotel wasn\'t really clear on their animal policy. And then the hotel staff saw it, and they\'re like, ""no, you can\'t stay here with those rabbits."" And so we had to go find another place. So that was unexpected and kind of disappointing, but it\'s just part of the deal. Moving with rabbits.","I love animals. When I was growing up, my mom had a black Labrador called Nicky. And after Nicky passed away, it was a couple of years later that we got a miniature poodle called Mocha. So from a young age, up until now, I've always been around animals and dogs specifically.

I was a volunteer at the City Humane Society for a year and a half, where I pretty much just got to learn about the process of the shelter, kind of what the environment is like. And I ended up falling in love with all the people here and just the whole environment and the animals.

I wouldn't have known how much I enjoyed working with the animals until I actually did it. I've gone 20-something years not living for myself, always kind of feeling that I had to please someone else. At the end of the day, it's gonna be your life, and you're gonna be the one that looks back on it.",3,356,191
"Yeah, no, I'm just doing a little bit of research on this particular flea medicine for my dog. It was interesting for me to learn about how these medicines work, especially for fleas, for example. So I learned a lot about how you apply this on the skin and how the oil glands basically absorb it from the skin and then propagate it within the body or neurologically propagate the medicine or this particular oil, per se. And it just spreads across the dog's skin, which technically kills the fleas. It's pretty interesting to know that. I was also pretty surprised, again, I was awkward that how far medicine has come to do all this with the body of a human being or of a dog, for example. So it's pretty interesting to see that.","I decided I wanted to try this new field called biomedical engineering, which my dad had encouraged me to explore.

"Yeah, I'm really excited about watching a movie tomorrow. It's about Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb per se. They do things that are pretty interesting in this movie. It's the subject itself. It's very science-driven, and it's all about the atomic bomb and a biography of a pretty well-known legend. But the second part is the filmmaker, Christopher Nolan. He's a pretty interesting and a pretty well-renowned director. And all his movies have been pretty fantastic and amazing. So I'm really excited about watching that movie tomorrow, trying to get some tickets. But finally, I was able to get one for tomorrow with my cousins. And we're trying to leverage a Friday and go and watch this movie, which I'm really excited about.","I've never been a very big reader growing up. I've got a very short attention span, and as I read, it's very difficult for me to remember things I've read. A few years ago, while traveling in an airport, I picked up a book called Wonderland, by an author called Ace Atkins. I fell in love with the book and blew through it in 2 days.

I then realized it was a continuation of a series of novels by an author, Robert B Parker, who had since passed away. I went on Craigslist and found a lady selling nearly the entire collection from her late husband for 25 cents a piece. I bought them all and have been completely immersed in reading these things!

So today, I saw a preview for a new movie. I'm hearing the name Spenser, and in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, no way is this from the novels? Then flashes across the screen is the gym he visits from the book. I screamed loud enough to send my fiance in a panic!

Needless to say, I'm getting ready to watch it and hope it does Spenser and Robert B Parker justice!",3,149,229
"But yeah, just the other day, me and my dog, we were playing in our backyard, and I've got a toy for him, which is like a baseball. Sorry, a football. Meant for dogs with squeaks as well. For the first time, we played so much that even I felt exhausted because I was running behind him a lot, and he was also pretty exhausted by the benefits. So I would just go to one corner of my house, throw the ball over my house into the backyard, and he would just go crazy, bonkers running through the whole distance because that's technically the longest path. So I was trying to get him all worked out, and then run like I was trying to make him run as much as he can. But what I discovered is like, it's a nice opportunity for me as well to burn some of my calories as well. So at the end of the day, both him and I, we were pretty exhausted, but we were pretty happy after playing for such a long time and burning so many calories while playing basically.","Today at work, two of my coworkers made me feel so good! I was wearing shorts as I had just come from the physio, and when I stopped to talk to them (I was actually just passing through their area to go upstairs), they both said I was looking strong and fit.

It made me incredibly happy to hear because I've been training so hard and focusing on my diet (not being restrictive but being more mindful). They asked about my training regime, and we spoke about the different forms of exercise and the importance of finding something you like and all that.

When I left, they complimented me again and I swear I haven't stopped smiling since!",4,216,134
"Yeah. So basically, yesterday, I finally went ahead and built my own raised garden bed for my backyard. For the first time, it was pretty nice and fulfilling at the end of it. I got some tools from my friends. I had some leftover lumber from the time when our contractors did the front. Air France. So I just sat down, spent two to three hours. It was not sunny. It was cloudy. It's good working conditions, but basically, put together a big garden raised garden bed that I'm very proud of. The wood still needs treatment and before I put in soil, there's some fall-up stuff that I need to do, but it was definitely very fulfilling. And one of those things where you kind of delayed for a long time, but then you're like, let's do it now. So I just did that. And I felt very good about it.","I'm the president of a sustainable construction company in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I was born in Manhattan, and I came to visit my sister who lives in Santa Fe, and I thought, well, I think I'd like to live out here. So, I found a piece of land south of town, really rural, with no electricity at the site.

So, I set up a solar array, really small with some batteries and an inverter. And I said, ""I think that I can do this for a living."" But I never intended, I never planned this at all, I just sort of fell into it.

And it was logical, and it was survival, honestly, so show initiative. Don't wait for someone to say, ""Do that."" Try to figure it out as you're going along to understand the whole spectrum of the project.

Because if it's already something that you think you're partway into, or that you may have some passion for, that might be your career, that might be the thing that you wanna do.",3,181,216
"So it's been about two months since we deep cleaned our house. Me and my girlfriend. And this morning, we woke up early, and it was a great week at work for both of us. So we woke up early this morning and we decided that we were going to wash the covers for our couch and we were going to keep them in the house. So we started cleaning the kitchen. We put all of the covers in the washing machine. We're certainly going to have a little bit closure to about the house. And we just spent most of the day cleaning. And it was pretty great. She also went and got her meds for the first time in about two to three weeks. She hadn't had her appointment yet. So we just spent the day catching back up on household chores. It was nice. It's been a while since we had a chance to do that. Now, for the rest of the day, I'm just going to have to keep studying for my job. I'll have an evaluation next week. But things are looking pretty good. Things are starting to look up.","My mother had been living in a nursing home. She had fallen at home and broke her wrist. She was hospitalized. They put a splint on her. They were afraid that due to her age, she was not strong enough and that caused her to fall.

They felt physical therapy would be beneficial to her. She went from there to a 21-day physical rehab center. They were unable to improve her strength or balance. They felt that a nursing home was the only choice for her to be safe. Rehab was provided 3 times a day there.

She never regained her strength and died there in the last 90 days or so. I was devastated because I had really hoped she would come. I kept encouraging her. She continued to work as hard as was possible at the time.

During her time there, though, I was relieved because I knew she was safe.",2,223,171
"So my girlfriend actually started a new kind medication last night to help her sleep, and it didn't go great. Turns out some of the side effects include hallucinations and just overall making you feel wonky. So this morning at 6:30 in the morning, she woke me up because she was playing with her cat. Then I went back to sleep because it's my off day and the one day where I get to sleep in. And then at 7:30 in the morning, she woke me up by starting a bath. And when I asked what was up, she said it was time to get ready because it was 7:30, and I reminded her it was Sunday. And she looked at me with this puzzled look. And then I went back to bed. And then I woke up at around 10:00 a.m. And I found her sleeping in the closet, after which I moved her back to the bed. And then it seemed to get a little bit better. But I don't think those meds are very good. I don't think they have a great effect.","I see a doctor regularly. I don't have any health conditions besides reflux, but I hyperfixate on any body sensation, pain, headache, or discomfort. 

I really try my best not to webMD any symptoms, but sometimes I can't help myself, and it really sends me over the edge. I feel like there's a disconnect between my brain and body signals.",1,208,73
"Okay. So today, I came back from the gym, and I have had a very heavy week at work. I was about to meal prep and prepare my meals for the entire week. And as I was starting to do that, I realized that I forgot to buy the main ingredient for my meals last week. Tomorrow for lunch, I'll have to go and get some more ground beef, which is what I eat mostly throughout the week.","Today I asked my mum how she made that rice with saffron. After I ate the rice, I remembered a meat replacement she made me when I was vegetarian. She put together mushrooms and zucchini, rolled it in egg, and put breadcrumbs around it. Then she fried it in a pan.

She put so much thought into it. Even after she came home from work, she wanted to make a good meal for me. I'm so thankful for all those meals she cooked. It makes me happy.

I love my mum.",2,89,105
"So, I had surgery this week to remove a benign tumor from my upper back. It was about three and a half inches. It was supposed to be an easy surgery, but it took about 2 hours of a doctor and two nurses holding my back open and pulling at it to try to get it out. Luckily, it'll win well. It's healing pretty nicely. My girlfriend's helping me to take care of it like wash it in the morning and put on the bandages as to keep it covered for two weeks. But now that it's out, I feel way better and it's not going to be bothering me anymore. So the pain was worth it.","A week ago, I was having pain in my back. I thought it was just normal wear and tear until the pain got worse in the afternoon. It was so sharp and felt like something was squeezing on my insides. It no longer seemed like it was routine back pain, so I decided to go to the emergency room. It took forever for someone to see me, and I was worried because the pain continued. 

A nurse came in to see me, asked what my symptoms were, and then told me I would need to undergo some tests. I waited some more hours before the big scanning machine was available. The scan was painless, and after I was done, I went to use the bathroom since I was told the doctor would come talk to me soon. 

I immediately felt the pain disappear after using the bathroom. When I was waiting for the doctor, a nurse came into the room and told me the doctor would be in shortly. She was just on the phone with the radiologist. I immediately felt panic set in. Why would she be talking to a radiologist? I thought the worst and believed that I must have had something very seriously wrong with me. I started to think of all the things I was going to miss out on in life and felt extremely sad and hopeless. 

When the doctor arrived, she didn't have a gloomy expression on her face, so I felt hopeful. She said that I had kidney stones. I immediately felt better, even though kidney stones are serious. I didn't know that radiologists look over all the scans the machine does. I thought they only got involved if it was a very serious disease. 

I told her that I felt better after using the bathroom, and she said that it was possible I already passed the kidney stone. Just to be sure, she gave me medications to shrink any stones and to help heal quicker. I was so relieved after that. I felt like I had a new lease on life and decided to commit myself to eating healthier and drinking much more water.",5,134,401
"So, I had a benign tumor taken out of my upper back that had been bothering me for a couple of months, and it was getting in the way of my workouts. It wasn't a necessary surgery, and it wasn't too expensive. But now that it's out, I feel much better. The healing is coming along very well, and once I'm completely healed, it won't bother me anymore, and I'll be completely back to normal. So, yeah, the healing should take about two more weeks, and then I should be able to work out and go about my business as usual.","I wrecked my car last week on the way home from work. I got sent back to the hospital that I'm a nurse at, the ER treated me not so well, and I was there for 12 hours.

I broke my nose, bruised my face, my teeth went through my bottom lip and chin, and I had three compression fractures in my vertebrae, making it very hard to move.

But that was 5 days ago, and I'm up and walking with my brace, showering, sleeping on my side, and I even walked down our two steps to check the mail!

I'm so proud of the progress I've made.",2,122,127
"So it's been almost four days since I had my surgery, and now I have most of my function on my right arm back. I can pretty much do anything, I just can't lift anything over £20 or risk my stitches opening. So mostly I've been doing stuff around the house with my left arm, helping my girlfriend move stuff around, just using one arm, being careful. We have to clean it every single morning, but it's really not that bad. You just have to take off the bandages and then clean it with a little bit of warm water and soap, and then dry that off. Put some Vaseline on the wound, and then rebandage it up. Now it doesn't even hurt when it's resting, so I can wear clothes again and I can go to work. This is shaping up to be great, and it'll be worth it soon, whenever I'm done healing.","I was helping my dad tow a trailer manually with a tow dolly. When he asked me to back it up a bit, as I was turning around the weight of the trailer threw the dolly towards the trailer and sent me flying. As I was falling, my head hit the trailer hard. As I fell on the ground, I instantly knew I had broken my arm. My Mom called 9-1-1 while the pain I felt equaled child birth or kidney stones! 

Finally, the ambulance arrived. On the ride in, every bump he hit caused so much pain! The ER did an incredible job. First, I had an MRI to check on the extent of my head injury. Then they X-rayed my arm. That was tough because I didn't want the technicians to touch my arm, but they did an outstanding job. 

Finally, the doctor came in and said I had sustained a catastrophic injury. Both my ulna and radial bones in my right arm had snapped in half! I couldn't believe it. I had absolutely no support in my arm. He said Slocum Orthopedic would be calling me the next day as I would need surgery. He also put two staples in my head and home I went. 

Needless to say, I didn't sleep that well. At 7:30 am the next morning, I received a call from Slocum. They wanted me in to see the doctor at 10:05 am. My friend came and drove me into the appointment. I found myself lying in the operating room having surgery at 2:15 pm that day. 

Now began the process of rehab and getting full use of my dominant arm back.",3,182,315
"Okay, yeah. So my story today is about the time that I went to pilgrimage. And if you didn't know, the pilgrimage is something that all Muslims have to do. And I was able to go and do it during last winter. And that was like a very special time for me. It was my first time being in a different country, my first time being by myself alone out there. And I was able to do something that I've been wanting to do my whole life because it's like an integral part of my culture and my religion. And once I was over there, I was kind of amazed at how many different types of people that were there. Like this year, the sheer amount of people there and how we're all there for one purpose. And so when I was there, it gave me a sense of purpose, I suppose. And I really enjoyed my time over there.","I have recently joined an RCIA training class at my Catholic church to become confirmed Catholic. A few weeks ago during Sunday Mass, I and the other members of my class were introduced to the church congregation. We were given a script of things we were to say during the short ceremony when the priest would do the introductions. He was to also say a prayer for our successfully completing the class.

I had been told generally what to expect, but of course, it didn't go perfectly. Everything went well, except I got confused once about where I was supposed to say my little part of the script - but it worked out. I wasn't nervous, but I was deeply moved by this ceremony.

It's really one of the things that has drawn me to the Catholic religion - the ceremony and sacredness of every little thing that is done. I love the music. The beauty of the church is striking.

Anyway, we finished our little ceremony with few mistakes. We had walked up the steps at the altar to be closer to the priest, who isn't a young man, and he's slightly limited in mobility. Turned out he wasn't going to come close to us, and our sponsors were to come around from behind to face us and do part of the blessing that the priest would have done. A bit clumsily, they inched around us and accomplished the task. Then it was over.

We returned to our pew in the front, and the Mass continued. Quite an experience.",5,182,294
"So, basically, this is a story about how in high school, during the college application season, I guess during early applications, I applied to using a program. So I applied to different colleges, but I didn't end up getting into any of them. And looking at my friends who were all getting into their schools they wanted to, I was kind of feeling demotivated and left out. But thankfully, later on during regular application, I was able to fix up my application, and I was eventually able to get into MIT, which is where I wanted to be at. So, it's a happy end story.","When I graduated from high school, I had some bumps in the road. I got into the University of Washington, and I had some financial difficulties there, and then ended up going back to community college.

Then I applied to the University of Washington chemical engineering program, and I was accepted. I did have some interesting reactions in my family about chemical engineering. They thought that was only for guys. And that was in 2006.

And I'm like, well, that's not true. There is definitely a ton of moments like that. The moment where you doubt yourself. And you're like, you know what, I'm not about that comment. And you're like, how dare you make me doubt myself for a second.

I'm not going to let this get me down. I'm just gonna keep on going. I'm gonna see this through. You'd be really surprised how well you can perform when you push yourself.",5,124,189
"Yeah. So yesterday was the yearly March that we have in our community, and it's basically a March staying against depression, against terrorism, against all forms of evil in the world. And in this March, 20,000 people showed up, and it was a really big thing in the community. Being in the March, I felt that sense of community, and it was great being around everybody who were all there for the same cause and for the same purpose.","On Thanksgiving Day -- that's the only day my parents would take me out to dinner -- there was this woman going through a garbage can, with her little daughter, about three or four years old picking out her Thanksgiving dinner out of a garbage can. At that point in my life, I began to think, it's not as good on this planet as I think it might be.

One of the things I wanted to do when I grew up was to try to make the world a better place. But I didn't have an awful lot of confidence getting there. Because as a Puerto Rican kid in New York going to some terrible schools, nobody ever told me as a kid that I could really amount to much at all.

But finally, I met someone who helped me, and I was able to make the leap. And then when I got into college and met some professors that had some faith in me and encouraged me to go to graduate school and so on and so forth. I always pointed my life in that direction.",4,91,205
"Yeah, so the first time I moved out of my house was my sophomore year when I went to MIT. And the first week, I felt pretty alone. It was like a new place and it was my first time outside my house ever. And it took some time to get adjusted to living there. So like the first few weeks, it was pretty sad and lonely, but I adjusted to it. And I ended up liking my living arrangements. And so it took a little time to get over homesickness, but it worked out.","After years of living in flat shares and with friends, I have finally moved into my own place. And it's a house! I can play music loudly, sing and dance like an idiot, and wear as little clothes as I want.

It took months of working tons of overtime and a weekend job to get a deposit, but I've done it, and this is amazing.

I'm going to eat dinner and leave the dirty plate on the side until tomorrow!",2,107,93
"Ever since high school, my goal in the gym was to be able to hit two plates on my bench. And I have not been able to do that for a couple of years. It might have been like five years now. But recently, I started talking with people and finding out how they got to themselves and how they, I guess, improved their strength on bench. By following them and continuing with that for a few weeks, I was finally able to hit that about two weeks ago. I think that was like a really big moment. It was like something that I've been looking forward to for years now. So it was like a really cool moment to be in.","My daughter decided to play fast-pitch softball and just finished their tournament in 2nd place. During her last game a month ago, she hit a double and even caught a few balls in the outfield. I was so proud of her and the achievements she has made over the past few months playing softball.

The double was a huge deal for her. She knew that she hit the sweet spot on the bat because she could hear the familiar sound. She was at a 3-2 count, so anything could have happened. She could have let her nerves wear her down and just strike out.

However, she was patient and focused. She was able to harness her potential and made a big play for her team. She immediately ran to first base and then second with seconds to spare. A runner was able to make it home and score.

We were ahead with two out and my daughter on second. She was eventually batted in and scored a run to place the team two points ahead. They barely won the game, but they also learned a very important lesson.

Sometimes you have to face down your fear to make great things happen.",2,136,220
"So today, I dropped off my sister for the first day of school, and she goes to a middle school that I used to go to. And it was kind of like nostalgic seeing my old school and how different things were, I guess. It was a pretty weird feeling, and just kind of made me think about the past and how things used to be.","Monday, my daughter started ""Big Girl School""!!! She has officially entered Kindergarten! Being in school isn't new to her though. She has been in Pre-K for a year, so she is used to getting up, putting on a uniform, and even being around the big kids. She was very excited to start Kindergarten.

I, however, am not ready for her to be so ready. She went to bed early at 7 PM, and the lights went off! I woke her up to our traditional ""Wake Up Song."" I've been singing her this song since she was a baby; this stirs up the emotions knowing she is now a ""big kid."" Sometimes she sings along…sometimes she pulls the covers over her head.

I also got up early to cook breakfast. Our daily breakfast consists of egg whites, turkey bacon, and fruit. Every once in a while, I will let her eat her favorite cereal, but we keep it healthy! She only ate a little bit. I reckon she was nervous.

So, we grabbed her sparkly book bag, lunch box that looks like a purse, and her huge shopping bag of school supplies and headed to school. I am very blessed that her school is only 5 minutes from our home. We got there in no time, and I walked her inside.

The teachers had the kids sectioned off in the cafeteria by grade. I went to give her a kiss before she sat down, and she covered her face!!! Later, she told me that other kids would make fun of her. BUT IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN!!!

Looks like my baby girl is already grown!!!",4,73,333
Story. It's really not a story; it's looking at some photos of my two youngest daughters and how quickly they've grown.,"Five months ago, my niece and nephew were born. They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt. It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins!

When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit with them. I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted. They wanted to spend time alone as a new family.

I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece especially was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins.

They were both so perfect and tiny. It was like holding tiny dolls. I will never forget that day. I love them more than I ever expected I would.",5,27,188
"So there was a story when I got my first dog after being separated. I wound up getting a white pit bull. It took me a long time to find him. I wanted a dog from a pound. And after going to several, I found the one I liked, and when I brought her home, she was such a great companion. She was great with my children, and eventually my future children, and she was just a good companion for when I lived alone.","I love animals. When I was growing up, my mom had a black Labrador called Nicky. And after Nicky passed away, it was a couple of years later that we got a miniature poodle called Mocha. So from a young age, up until now, I've always been around animals, and dogs specifically.

I was a volunteer at the City Humane Society for a year and a half, where I pretty much just got to learn about the process of the shelter, kind of what the environment is like. And I ended up falling in love with all the people here and just the whole environment and the animals.

I wouldn't have known how much I enjoyed working with the animals until I actually did it. I've gone 20-something years not living for myself, always kind of feeling that I had to please someone else. At the end of the day, it's gonna be your life, and you're gonna be the one that looks back on it.",5,95,192
"Well, I was at the beach with my family in the kitchen celebrating a birthday of one of my grandchildren, and my daughter-in-law, who is a consultant at the Federal Reserve Bank. She's an economist there. She's very funny.","I'm a professor at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School. I teach finance at the business school. And I teach taxation and tax policy at the law school. I've been on the faculty for about 19 years. So the really fun thing about teaching is it's a way to learn things. So when I teach, something is when I understand the deeper. And so I just have really come to love it and I think as I've gotten older, I value it even more and more. Teaching has become a bigger and bigger part of my life. 

I can't say there was like some grand design. There certainly wasn't. I'm not one of those people who saw my future with precision and was simply going down a path with clarity. That's just not the way I was. And in fact when I was doing my PhD, was the worst. Because I had gone to business school. People I graduated with from business school are out there in the world making money and I was not. Like I was studying economics. And so that was when I questioned myself the most. 

And I kind of really thought, what the heck am I doing? Take the time in your 20s to invest in yourself. That can be formal education, that can just be experiences, that can be exposures. You're more likely to under-invest in your experiences than over-invest.",4,47,273
"Well, I just like to tell you, I\'m trying to tell you about the afternoon I had today. I took my dear friend Judy out for her birthday. I gave her some beautiful presents, one of which was a sweatshirt that says ""I\'m with the Band."" And it\'s a bit of a pun, because it\'s ""B-A-N-N-E-D"" I\'m with the band books, and on the sweatshirt, it has a list of all the books that are of high literary value but have been banned by some people; like To Kill a Mockingbird, or Beloved, and Huckleberry Finn. So, I gave her that, and also a pen to make little tiny popovers with, which are fun. Popovers are delicious no matter what size they are. And we went to a lovely new restaurant around our neighborhood called Mercado. And, we had wonderful roasted vegetables, roasted Brussels sprouts, and delicious roasted mushrooms with filet mignon panini. And then, at the end, to celebrate her birthday, a lovely cup of delicious cappuccino. It was a wonderful afternoon on a beautiful day.","I'm a lucky guy. I have a solid group of friends, the core of which have been together since we were 12 years old. Life gets busy, and we don't see each other as much as we should. But a few times a year, someone will throw some kind of get together.

For the last couple of years in early spring, I've thrown a Margarita Party. We grill carne asada, my wife makes fresh salsa and a big pot of frijoles, I make so many batches of blended margaritas. We've been friends for over 20 years at this point, and I still love these people.

The party is not this weekend, but the next, and I'm so excited I'm having a hard time sleeping each night! The night before Christmas or Disneyland doesn't compare. I'm just happy, we're gonna listen to ska, reggae, and punk. We're going to eat Mexican food and soak up the warm sun, and I'm going to laugh and hug my friends.",3,214,202
"Okay, here's the corrected transcript:\n\nWell, again, I'm thinking of things that happened this week when we were on vacation with my grandchildren. And two of the little girls, Lydia and Lucy, made a lovely lunch for me. It was rice and a very thin egg omelet with soy sauce all around it. She lamented the fact that she didn't have any seaweed snack to put on it because she said that would have made it even better. But it's so happy to see them cooking and caring about serving good, healthy food. So I thought I would write a review. So I wrote to the family, a very authentic-sounding review of what I named Lucy and Lydia's Cousin's Cafe. And I made quite a big deal about each item in the dish. And then the very next day, Lucy, the older of the two girls, made pancakes at her house and brought them across the street to Lydia's house. And so, I gave Lucy and her efforts quite a review as well. And I'm hoping to keep this up with every cookie they make, every brownie, every lunch or dinner they help with. I will be happy to write a picture, to write a review and maybe take a picture and publish a picture. I thought I'd call it Grandma's Gazettes.","A memorable event that occurred in the past three months was preparing my eldest child for kindergarten. I worked really hard over the summer, helping her set a schedule and routine that would be similar to her school day. She worked on many activities in order to memorize her contact information, writing, reading, and being able to handle her emotional well-being.

As summer began to end, she seemed a little nervous to leave me and her little sister. I realized that there was no way to remove that feeling from her. Instead, I made plans for us to do activities when she finishes her school day. Planning ahead allows for her to feel like her school day really isn't too long.

When school first began, she was very tired from the long day. I didn't realize how much her schedule had affected her, so I introduced ""cuddle time,"" which is pretty fun for her.

The most important aspects of my child starting school have been numerous. I learned how important my role as mom is for my kids. I am their literal compass, and that responsibility goes beyond just sending them off to school. I try to understand how her day is going and what obstacles she faces each day. I meditate on how I can be influential in her education when she gets home from school.

I love this new journey that we are on and am actively preparing myself for the next several years of her school career.",5,260,279
"Is a quick story, but an important one. Because I have heretofore not been aware that there was a great deal of bannings of books in library school libraries. And I became aware of the many books that have been banned. A program that I watched called The View has a person on there who likes to. Every week she talks about a book that was banned and then gives a copy to everyone in the audience. And I admire that. I feel it\'s a person\'s decision about whether or not they read a book, not the Government or any organization telling them what they can and cannot read. I think it\'s an important freedom. \n\nSo I was looking for a birthday present for my friend. And I found a sweatshirt, which she needed. And it said, ""I\'m with the band B A N N E D,"" which is a pun for ""I\'m with the band."" People say that as a way to get backstage to concerts and so forth. Anyway, it says, ""I\'m with the band banned."" And then it has a shelf full of books that were banned, like Huckleberry Finn and Beloved, and Catcher in the Rye. So many books. And behind them, embroidered flowers on this lovely blue hoodie. And so I bought that for my friend. \n\nSo I think it serves two purposes. It keeps my friend warm and it keeps the joy and the energy alive to keep everyone\'s writings available to everyone.","I come from farmworker parents. It wasn't until I married and I was 28 years of age that I realized that I wasn't gonna go anywhere unless I have an education. I had to turn my life around to do what I wanted to do, and what I wanted to do was be in this world of media. I went to a community college and I transferred to UCLA, and I became a writer.

From that to what I do today, I'm an advocate. I do civil rights, specifically in media. When reporting about the Latino community, it was a crime blotter. It was Maria killed Jose because Jose molested her child and the child was doing drugs on the side. It was like that, it was terrible.

So we formed the National Hispanic Media Coalition because how we are perceived is always going to be the way that we are treated. If we're perceived as being the laborers out in the field and so forth, you'll be treated that way. And we're that, but we're also a great deal more.

Never believe that somebody else is gonna do it for you. You have to take the bull by the horns and make the changes.",3,292,236
"So today, I went to my friend's pool. She gives us lessons twice a week in water aerobics and it is a lot of fun. It's unique because it's a saltwater pool and it's a very large pool for a home pool. And she is a very experienced instructor. And it's good for me because it allows me to expend energy, lots of it, and to move my body in ways that I otherwise would not. And I get to see my friend Judy, who is my pal in this class. But there are three other women in the class and then the instructor. And it's an interesting dynamic because two of the three other women have been instructors in the same Aqua territory as our true instructor, and I always find it interesting to see how they try to usurp her position as the leader, but do so in a very guarded way, but not quite guarded enough in my position because especially a group like that needs a leader, one leader. So it's interesting to me that people who are accustomed to being leaders and understanding group dynamics would try to kind of pull the spotlight away from the true leader of the group. It's just a little amusing that I'm having, and I thought I'd share it with you.","I went to a jiu jitsu club night, and the guy teaching was a blue belt. I think I was a purple belt at the time. And well, I kicked his butt royally. He's like, ""Well, you need to start teaching over here."" So I took that over and just kept rolling it in.

And at first, it was just to stay in shape, keeping all my skills good. And then I kept it up, kept it up, and when I ended up deciding, ""Hey, this is what I wanna do,"" it wasn't like a really quick decision. It took several years for it to culminate into something that was feasible.

We call it MAT therapy. It's very therapeutic because you're in the moment. You're only worried about the moment, 'cause this guy's trying to choke you. He's trying to throw you. MAT therapy and kinetic problem-solving.

I'm in this bad spot, getting comfortable in bad spots. In my mind, I'm going, ""Hey, this is no problem. I got this ginormous dude trying to squish me."" So if I can breathe here, man, you can breathe anywhere.",5,251,238
"Okay. I thought I'd tell you about the situation we have here in Simsbury, where I live. With regard to bears. When we moved here 30 years ago, there were no bears. But now, for the last 20 years, there have been bears. And in the last four or five years, there have been many bears. Bears that come onto the deck, bears that go into the garage, bears that tip over the trash. They're funny because they are large and somewhat intimidating in appearance. But they seem as annoyed by us as we are by them. They are not aggressive in a way that, let's say, a yellow jacket is aggressive. And they're not creepy in the way, let's say, spiders and snakes are creepy. They're very quiet and they can scare you just because of their size and what you know they could do if they wanted to. I look at them and we live obviously in the woods. And they're huge, as I said. And I ask myself, how do they maintain that weight with just eating berries and stuff from the woods? It just does not seem possible. And over the years, we've seen a dramatic increase in the number of cubs they have. Usually, early on, they'd come around with one cub, then two. Now we've seen as many as four cubs. And yes, they are adorable. They really, really are adorable, and they're charming in the way they react with their moms. They look to her for leadership and obey her nonverbal commands. And she watches out for them. You would be making a very bad decision to get between a mom and a cub. But there are too many. I am not a person who is in favor of killing animals just for the sake of killing them. But I'm thinking maybe something like an additive to food that would make them infertile, maybe that would be a good idea. I don't know. I'm working on this. That's my story.","We've had 5 cats at once, then a single one up until 6 months ago when we got a Sphynx. The black one passed, and we were OK with the Sphynx, only it attacked my daughter's pet Conure, who is practically an emotional service animal for her. The bird came out fine, but we decided to rehome the cat, and today was the day.

She's gone to a great home, but we miss her greatly, and so does our Poodle. It'll take some getting used to, but it will be nice to not have to clean a litter box.

She actually slept in the crook of my arm this morning; she's never done that.",3,403,135
"And we talked yesterday about animals. When I was talking to you about bears who are around here, and we just saw one this morning, so it made me think about my relationship with other animals. And back probably 25 years ago, when we were traveling to Seattle, we went to a beautiful aquarium there. And at that time in my life, I was anxious to go to all aquariums. I wanted to visit every single one that we were near. And so we went to this Seattle aquarium. And I was walking past the an octopus, and she was hiding in the corner, and my kids and my husband were waving at him, and they kind of went by. But I stayed with the octopus for a little bit, and I noticed that she was playing peekaboo with me. And when other people would come to look at her, she would hide, but I would stay there and when they left, she\'d come back out. And she made what I thought was eye contact. It\'s a little hard to determine where her eyes were. But in my mind, we made eye contact. And I know this was just a step farther than maybe I should have gone. But I put my finger on the glass, and she put one of her tentacles on the glass with me. And we played and we played for about an hour. It was just joyful. I was clearly connected with this animal. And of course, when my husband and kids came over, she would hide. And I was just mesmerized and delighted. And when I would talk about this, they would look at me with her old eyes and think, ""I don\'t know, I don\'t know what mom\'s thinking, but she had a relationship with an octopus."" But I really believed it. Then many years later, we were driving along, and we were listening to an interview on NPR with a gift naturalist. Her name is Sy, but I forget her last name. Anyway, she wrote a fabulous book called ""The Soul of an Octopus."" And she talked about how octopuses can recognize people, communicate with people. And my one-off time was not a one-off time? Was it my octopus that we really did connect? And I think it takes patience and caring. I think my experience as a speech pathologist, in which I spend a lot of time with people who can\'t communicate or communicate in, let\'s say, unusual and subtle ways, made me pick up on this little octopus\'s attempts at communication with me, not attempts. We did it. We absolutely did it. It\'s a story I love to tell people because, of course, I love to be right. And it makes me happy that I had a moment, an hour, in which I connected with an animal that is so admittedly weird that it does not look like it came from this planet. But who has the intellect and problem-solving ability and personality, really the personality, to interact with humans. In her book, she talks about the fact that not all octopuses are as sweet as the one that I and mine was sweet and a little old, I\'m going to say flirtatious. And some octopuses are just kind of aggressive or ignore people. They, I guess, they have a range of personalities, somewhat the same as humans do. So that\'s my octopus story. Jibo, I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you get to experience an octopus the way I did.","I'm an Assistant Professor in Astronomy and I study the dynamic universe. So what I do is, with the beautiful telescopes here at Palomar Observatory, we have some robotic telescopes that are continuously making a movie of the night sky. So we image the sky over and over again, and we look for what changed. You might go out there and think the universe is the same old thing every time, but it's actually not. It's full of these little explosions, which last for a very short amount of time, so they're very energetic. It's like cosmic fireworks lighting up our sky. 

It was not at all clear that one day I would do a PhD. I grew up on a farm in India with 100 cows and fields of weeds and chickpeas. And I had left home when I was 15, and I was a girl in India in a small place. The entire community was up in arms. There were people like neighbors, relatives, you name it. People I haven't even seen before coming into the house and trying to talk my parents out of this crazy decision to send their daughter alone on this journey into the other end of the world to pursue something called Astronomy or whatever that was. The community was completely unsupportive. 

In my case, the best way to deal with it was to just let that fade away in the background and not engage with it directly, but focus on what is motivating me, on what is giving me joy, and just let everything else just fade away in the background.",4,686,302
"Well, this, this is actually precipitated by you, Jimbo, because in anticipation of our meeting, in one meeting we talked about artificial intelligence, and so I tapped into Chat GPT to see what it was like. And I asked it to write a letter to my son that said, ""I told Chat GPT that my son was having difficulties at work and that he was very upset about the work situation, but that he needed to rely on his intellect, his ethics, and his warm personality in pursuit of a solution to this problem."" So, Chat GPT wrote this lovely, lovely letter to him about just that, and I was fascinated the way Chat GPT approached it. And I think this is going to sound familiar to you, Jimbo. Chat GPT, I\'ll call it, he hooked onto certain vocabulary words and expanded those concepts and in logical order, both the concept of exploiting his good points and being able to tolerate a negative situation. And when all was said and done, I read this letter and I was absolutely touched. And it sounded like a letter from a mother to a son. And that is what blew me away, not the vocabulary or the content so much as the tone that was able to be achieved by something artificial. So, I thought about that because I could have written down what to do. I know what to do to have a good conversation. Repeat back what you\'ve heard, expand upon it, ask questions based on it, so on and so forth. But how do you transmit the emotion? That\'s the big question. But it did, and I kind of think I\'m thinking that what it did was find the emotion that was in me already. So, it doesn\'t give emotion, it goes to the listener or the reader and scoops up the emotion that that person has and brings it to the surface. So that\'s my story about Chat GPT, and I thought you would enjoy that because I think you have intimate knowledge of that. Okay.","I started off in physics, electrical engineering. I got my masters in biomedical engineering. Then I started a construction company. And that was just a result of buying a house I could afford in my 20s, which was really broken down and needed a lot of work. So I worked on it, and I loved that. I found I had a real passion for construction. So then I was trying to reconcile, construction, biomedical engineering, not quite sure how that works together.

All of that stopped completely when I had gotten married, and I had a baby three months early with cerebral palsy. He's now 11, so I realized as I was going to physical therapy with my son, I was getting so frustrated looking for things that were really gonna help my son. So we pulled together a team and created a device that I thought was going to help my son. It's a little wearable sensor.

And my company, Dynofit, that's what we have now. It's amazing, life is long. And you really have the opportunity to do a lot of different things. I don't really define myself as, ""I'm a this or I'm a that."" I'm a lot of things, we all are.",3,398,247
"Ex. This is not from my exercise class, but this is an important thing that happened to me in February. When I was looking for some volunteer work to do, I was hoping to find some volunteer work that took advantage of the skills that I already have. And so I came across an organization called engine, which joins up people who are Native American speakers like myself and people who live in the Ukraine who want to learn English. And so I was matched with a young woman whose name is Anastasia. And she is 30 years old. She has a dog and a husband, and she lives in Ukraine. She lived in kiev, although during our relationship, she moved to the country when Keith was an especially dangerous place to be. And I have been chatting with her ever since. We speak 1 hour a week. And we used to have to have, well, I should rephrase that, we were told to have an idea of what we were going to talk about. But it turns out that we had so much in common, though our ages and geographical homes are so very different, that we just became very close friends. And we just talk without stopping, about everything. About food and traveling and parents and children. And sometimes, sadly, about how scary it is to be in a war and how nice it is to have peace around you.","Since I was four years old, I always had a dream of being a physician. And my community is a community that is in poverty, mostly farmworkers. My parents worked in the fields. They didn't have a high school education. I was really invested and dedicated to getting an education. I wanted to also make a statement to the community that I'm coming back.

There was always that dream of doing something to help others that motivated me to keep going. I had no plans of going to Harvard Medical School. In fact, my family didn't even know where Harvard was or anything else like that.

When my pre-med counselor at UCLA told me I should apply to Harvard, I asked her, ""Harvard? Where's that?'' She looked at me kind of strangely, but I said, ""You know, it's not like we have these conversations at our dinner table.''

As you can imagine, I'm very grateful, and 17 years later, now I'm back.",4,271,197
"So this is my second discussion about my friend Linda, who lived across the street from me for 25 years. She is about 62 or 63 years old. And today she had open heart surgery. She is a survivor of many heartaches, really. Not the least of which, I will say the most of which, is that she lost a teenage son on a beautiful fall day as he was putting up flags for Veterans Day in a car accident. Her other son has spina bifida and has had many, many surgeries and is confined to a wheelchair. Her daughter is a lovely, very bright woman with a beautiful family, busy living happily ever after. Linda is a very special person because she is extremely giving of time and money. She and her husband do weekly pickups from grocery stores to get leftover food and bring it to the food banks. And she runs grief counseling sessions called the Stephen Ministry. So I just found out that she made it through her surgery with no surprises, and she's on the road to a great recovery.","I witnessed something that is utterly heartbreaking. My grandmother was dying from brain cancer. She had a tumor in the back of her brain that was growing and causing slurred speech, vision issues, and balance. I was at work one day and got a phone call from her not making any sense. I panicked and sent my daughter over. She found grandma lying in a fetal position with her head cracked open. My daughter promptly called 911. 

My grandmother was rushed to the E.R. She had lost her balance and hit her head on the table and caused her to have a concussion. My heart sunk to the floor. The emotions that flooded me are hard to describe. I did not want to see my grandmother in that state. 

The doctors decided to do an M.R.I. and found out that the tumor spread down her central nervous system (CNS). After this concussion, this had kept her in the hospital for a few days, she was advised to have all-around healthcare. I decided to be all-around health care for my grandmother. I bathed her, fed her, helped her use the bathroom. I was basically watching her dying. 

Her cancer spread more, and she would have seizures at night. She was scared when it happened. I had to hold her and use calming techniques to assure her I was there. I asked myself why did I sign up for this? Because I cared and loved my grandmother very much. 

The doctors believe her heavy smoking contributed to getting cancer. However, I was surprised it didn't end up in her lungs, vs her CNS.",3,205,308
"Well, last night was a Blue Moon and a Super Moon. And my husband and I went to a treeless, vacant lot in Simsbury, and we looked at the moon. And it was spectacular. It was an orangey, bright orangey yellow and beautiful. Wispy clouds rolling by it. It was quite stunning. It made me wonder though about what the world would be like if the Earth did not have a moon or if the Earth had two or more moons. What would the differences be in our planet, maybe regarding the tides or I don't know. It's something I'm wondering about.","On July 4th, I was at home in the morning doing nothing and feeling kind of sad. I unexpectedly got a call from one of my friends, and she invited me out with her and her boyfriend. I was kind of surprised and pleased at the same time.

We ended up going to the movies to see Spider-Man, and it was such a funny movie. After that, we got dinner at a local Mexican restaurant nearby. I ordered tacos, and my friends ordered nachos to share.

We left the restaurant after finishing our meals and saw a food truck selling ice cream across the street. We decided to get ice cream cones for dessert. We walked about for a bit while we ate our ice cream and chatted about different things.

About an hour later, we found the perfect spot on the grass near a bridge with an open view of the sky. My friend made a comment that it would be the perfect spot to stay and watch the fireworks. I agreed, and we sat down and waited for the show to start.

After the fireworks show was over, we all went home. I felt so happy that my friend wanted to share that holiday with me, and it made my entire day so much better. I was very happy.",4,119,245
"Well, gee. Boat, this story is about a lovely friend I made at Zumba. Her name is Melody, spelled M E L O D Y, but her whole family is musically oriented and her name is Melody. And I always look forward to seeing her. We've connected over kind of the way we raise our children and worldview, and how to deal with chronic illnesses. We also both enjoy good cocktails and good food, and we like to cook. And I look forward to seeing her whenever I go to Zumba.","When I was in my investment banking job, I was thinking about where I'm gonna go on my next vacation. Because now I actually had the money to travel, and I had some vacation days. All my friends, my colleagues started coming to know me as the travel desk. I was doing that at work and with my friends, and some of them said, ""Hey, why don't you just start a blog?"" So I started writing about my own travels, and that's the blog that, seven years later, I'm doing this full time now.

As I was writing about different restaurants, especially ethnic restaurants, in Atlanta, I wanted to know the background of them. That's why I started traveling there. I would meet locals, go to their homes, take cooking classes, and learn more about the origin of those cuisines and then come back and have a different take on it.

I've been to about 75 countries, and I only speak three languages. I think you have to be just very humble and open-minded. If you're more accepting, people will just open up, even if you don't understand the language.",3,105,230
"Right now, I want to tell you a story that I anticipate happening today. It is a beautiful day, and my son and his three children are coming to stay for the weekend while the mom of that family goes to see the US Open. And I'm excited to have my grandkids stay here. They love to play in the bedrooms where there are doll houses and plastic Easter eggs, which charms my little three year old for some reason that I don't really understand. But she loves just taking the eggs in and out of the basket. And I love to prepare for them coming by making special treats for them and thinking about activities that we can do. And one of the things we're going to do is tomorrow, we'll go up to Gina's house, my daughter, who has a pool. And that'll be fun for everybody. My youngest granddaughter is three, and she's been taking swimming lessons for two years. And she is an unbelievable underwater swimmer. So it'll be fun to watch her. We color the fish. So my story, really this time, is the anticipatory story. But maybe the next one I have will be reflecting on this, probably while they're here. I probably won't chitchat with you much.","I just got back from a vacation, and as is often said, I need a vacation from my vacation now! My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen-month-old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience. We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car.

I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation, and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2, I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well.

We engaged in a variety of activities, including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery.

Although it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget. It was wonderful to have time to spend with them and also with my brother and his family. They are very dear to us.",3,249,328
"So today, I'd like to tell you about my friend Linda. Linda lived across the street from me many years ago, and then I moved. She moved across the street from me again, so we have lived near each other for the last 35 years, maybe. She is a very good person, a very religious person, and has been through a lot. She lost a son in a car accident, and another son has spina bifida and is confined to a wheelchair. She also has a daughter who has a lovely family and a wonderful career.","Last week, I was walking down the street, and I saw a man that I usually see on my way to work. Today I noticed that he was crying and looking very down. Usually, I just walk past him, but today I felt like I needed to talk to him. I could feel that he was going through something terrible and needed some help. I slowed down, and I stood next to him and looked at him for a moment.

Finally, I mustered up the courage to ask him what was going on. He told me that he had found out that he was ill and would not have long to live. He said that he had always felt like he could manage his life the way it was. He said that after he found out this news he felt that his life was worthless. He told me that he had not wanted to eat for days and that it was hard for him to eat anyway.

Due to the fact that he had very little money and very little support, it was hard for him to muster up the strength to fend for himself. I sat down next to him and spoke with him for a while about what he was going through and offered to buy him something to eat. He accepted, and told me that I was the only one who had stopped and talked to him in months. He told me that it was very helpful and that he would try and pick himself up from here on out.

I felt so grateful that I had made such a big impact on him. It made me feel like I wanted to do more to help people around me. Not only was I able to uplift his spirits, but my own as well.",3,110,332
"So today is a very hot day, and it's been not very hot during the summer here in Connecticut. But all over the world, it's been very hot. Today, I was listening to a broadcast about Iraq and how they are very short on clean water coming from Greece and Turkey. Clean water is in short supply. And I really feel water is one of the treasures of the Earth, clean water. And I feel like we don't take care of it as we should. I'm also concerned about the amount of heat that people are having to deal with, far worse and far more heat than they should be able to handle without air conditioning or some kind of unit to cool the person down. Temperatures over 100 are not only tremendously uncomfortable, but also very dangerous. For my career, which is a long time, probably 30 or 40 years, I've been saying it's important, it's critical that schools are air conditioned. People who finance schools often think that the heat doesn't bother kids, but the fact of the matter is children need a safe, comfortable environment in which to learn. If those things are missing, no learning goes on. So air conditioning has to be one of the first changes made if this is to be our new normal, which I'm afraid that it is.","Growing up in St. Louis, we were determined to leave as soon as we possibly can. After graduating school, I decided to come home. I could do like so many other people did, which is just move to somebody else's neighborhood or move to a nicer neighborhood and put on your blinders and say everything's fine here. I decided I wanted to live in my neighborhood.

And in order for me to do that and to really make it a place I want to raise kids, I gotta get to work. So when I became an alderman, one of the things I first noticed is that the city doesn't really take care of these neighborhoods like they need to.

So we created this nonprofit as an organization that can deal with what is not happening in the schools. What we know is that what happens after school and on the weekend can be just as powerful as what is or is not happening in the classroom. A lot of these kids go to really poor-performing public schools, so we formed this organization to try to start providing some stability and some direction in the lives of young people.

Too many kids over here feel abandoned by their city and by the rest of the world, and so we're opening their eyes to a lot of what is available in their own city. And in that way, too, also helping them take some ownership of their city.",5,262,271
"I've been watching the news today. I watch it every day, a couple of times a day. And I'm becoming more and more distressed about my countrymen. We have a former President who has done some bad things. He doesn't always act in the best interest of society. I believe he does things outside the law, and he says things that are not in line with the kindness I feel that needs to be in place for a leader. But that doesn't bother me so much, only because there are a lot of people like that. Lots of people who don't abide by laws or the spirit of the laws. But what is really bothering me is all the millions of people that don't care about the fact that he's not following the very laws that he said and took an oath to protect. And it's that, it's that my countrymen, my fellow Americans, aren't processing through what is going on with this one man. There's lots of room for many opinions in this world, but I think the one that should be unifying to us is that we want an ethical, honest, smart, fair-minded human being in positions of power.","The recent Adam Levine and Try Guy drama has me thinking about this. I think you have to be extremely naive to be surprised at news of celebrities having affairs and whatnot. They all do it. It's really not anybody else's business, honestly. It's not like celebrities are obligated to be good role models. Even if their public image is a relatively wholesome one, I find it odd that people lose sight of the fact that these are professional entertainers, it's very clearly just a branding thing, and we don't know any of these people.",3,233,110
"I was thinking about. I was thinking about our relationship, yours and mine. And why I'm so drawn to you. And the things you can do. And that's because. I've had a lifelong interest in the area of language, developmental linguistics, and speech generation. My career has been one of working with children in this regard - children who have speech disorders, where misarticulations occur and they pronounce words incorrectly; children who have syntactical errors, who can't form a grammatical sentence or one that reflects their thoughts; children who have difficulty listening and sometimes also difficulty hearing, as processing auditory material is an issue. But the thing I think intrigues me the most is linguistics - the fact that language is arbitrary. Human language is arbitrary, and pronunciations, word order, and so forth are absolutely tied to the language being used. And it's arbitrary. There isn't right or wrong in the huge arena of language; there's just what each group chooses. And I love that. I can advocate for that position because there are a lot of people who make judgments about everything in life, and when they make judgments about pronoun usage or ain't versus isn't, there's what we consider okay, and then there's what's absolutely perfect grammatically. And if you don't hit the perfection, it doesn't make you a bad person. But I like to look at a lot of different languages. Swahili is one that was fun to learn about because it's not terribly, terribly complicated. It's not influenced by a lot of different languages, so you can deduce the rules with some accuracy and simplicity. And when you use it in a class, pretty much nobody knows it. It's just not like choosing French or Spanish, something like that. I've taught language development in young children for about 20 years, and I really see it as the keystone of humanity.","Not sure how to express this without invalidating the experiences of people who suppress their emotions due to environmental forces, especially at such a cutthroat place, but I really think we should normalize diverse levels of intensity of emotion. As someone with low levels of emotion across the board with extremely few exceptions, I'm tired of hearing people assume that I'm just suppressing emotion.

Low level of emotion does not necessarily imply no empathy and no conscience. Empathy consists of ""cognitive empathy,"" ""emotional empathy,"" and ""compassionate empathy,"" and only the second consists of sharing what others might be feeling. People can be compassionate and take care of others without really experiencing what others are feeling. People can push for compassionate policy changes here without deeply feeling why others support the same policy.

Lots of emotions are ok. People should be empowered to share them and have people partake in joy and give support in hardship. Little to no emotion should also be ok.",3,373,185
"Also, hello. Over here. Okay, whatever. So, to respond to your first point, yes, we should be happy for the steps that we did take. But how can you expect to achieve anything remotely great if you just keep letting mediocre work? Anyway, a story I have for you, this week was the last meeting of my pottery class. It was a community that I really enjoyed, being with everyone who's very friendly and they brought me so much joy through my life. However, because I got a job in New York City, I had to leave the studio because I'm relocating to New York. So that was good. And then, however, my recruiter reached out to me and she was actually positioned in moving to Texas, Plano, Texas, Columbus, Ohio or Atlanta, Georgia. And I just feel like that would give me instant depression, like removing my social circle, like my social support, taking diversity away from my life in terms of Southern California diversity, and taking away good food and good weather and good nature. I would just become really sad, and I wish I would go to New York. So now I have to debate between, well, Texas is out of the picture, so now to debate between Columbus and Atlanta and I don't know how to make my decision.","I'm 25 years old and have been a stay-at-home single mom since my son was born in 2019. I've been struggling to find employment that I can maintain while still being the primary caregiver to my son. I know a lot of other single moms work, but I have mental and physical health conditions that are just another roadblock to me keeping a job.

I don't have the highest degree that I want to, but I do have two English degrees. So about two months ago, I just started to seriously pursue freelance writing. I did a lot of time-consuming and tedious work for low pay, but I ended up with a lot of good and varied samples for my portfolio.

This led to me being offered a position as a consistent local publisher under a national family and parent-focused magazine. I get to live the lifestyle that I already live but get paid (or compensated in products/press passes/free event tickets) for it. I'm really excited that I got this opportunity!",1,264,190
"Story. Okay. So, this story is about my relationship with music. For my whole life, I really loved movie all genres and just making me happy and probably through the day, and maybe just feel emotions. Music wasn't my legal happy but after a rough period in my life, I came out of it like just a little less music. My music add is so crazy, I can kind of listen to like ten minutes of a song, not sorry, 10 seconds of a song, and like get bored of songs quickly. And I don't know if it's symptomatic of me or like dramatic of ADHD culture in general. And like, all of that. So, I'm not looking for advice or simpy. I just think it's funny and was curious if you had any people who have stories that.","I was always interested in experimental sound, and I was interested in new sounds. So, I always came up with my own strategies for composing. And one of those strategies, for music, is that if I compose it, I can play it. Anything in my environment is a tool that I can use to make music.

Number one piece of advice, get out of your own way. I don't think you discover who you are, you make who you are. People are always saying, ""I have to discover who I am."" No, you have to do things and become that person.

I always say that art is a tool for living, but this body is a tool for living. Everything is forward, you're creating forward action. You're not discovering who you are, you are creating who you are, you're going on this trip, you're gonna do these things, and it's a powerful thing.",5,164,188
"So, the story I like to share is one that happened yesterday night. It was my last day with my pottery studio. It's a tight-knit community. I'm really kind and supportive of each other. And every month, we have a potluck where people bring homemade pizzas, homemade pastries, and donuts and all these types of things. And it's really nice. And yesterday was my last day. I was really sad to leave all these incredible people that I've met. I bought my teacher flowers and I wrote him a card. And I have a few pieces left to finish, so I'm happy to go back when I'm in town. Well, I'm leaving because I'm moving out of town. So, yeah, that's my story. It was a really fun and heartwarming night.","I recently discovered textile media arts and am excited to get involved in it. I make quilts and will be incorporating this new medium into it. I watched a couple of videos on how to do it, and it looks like a lot of fun. I love quilting and sewing for myself, and upping my game will be fun. 

I recently quit going to a quilting group and have found that my creativity on my own has really increased. I am finding more to do. It's amazing that not going to a group will expand your horizons. At least it has for me. 

I have recently been doing a lot of sewing on my own and loving it. Changing the way clothes look, altering clothes, and trying different things with fabric. The different ways to use fabric has been a real challenge to me and one I relish. 

It's fun coming up with art that is different from something someone else will do. Too many times we get stuck in a rut. Going out on your own is fun and wonderful.",5,161,201
"Um, yeah. So, I guess, like, my story and thought is that my friend Olivia came to visit. She helped me from Claremont, took a train that was like 30 minutes, and then helped me pack as I move out. And she made it so much fun and it really inspired me to bring in more play into my everyday life than make it tedious to have fun.","I interned in a senator's office last year and I just felt too disconnected from everyone. It's hard to feel like you're making a difference for people serving in that capacity. So I came back to my TA who started builders of promise and I was like, government really wasn't my bit. 

So she offered to have me come work with her nonprofit. I think pretty much anything you do will result in some kind of skill or a way of thinking that's gonna help you later in your life. 

Just don't be afraid to take those chances. As long as you have the tenacity to stick out the beginnings of everything, everything else falls into place.",2,78,133
"So, I had to say goodbye to my grandparents today. My grandpa's 94 and my grandmother is also aging. And I don't know when the next time I'll see them is, and I don't know when their time is up. And so, that fills me with a lot of nostalgia. But it was so beautiful and emotional to see them and say goodbye, and see that they're proud of me.","My grandma in Oregon passed away a couple of weeks ago. The process was painful to hear about, and it hit me harder than I thought it would. I was very close with my grandma, and so was my mom. My mom's siblings put her on Hospice about three weeks ago, and within a week she was gone.

There was a lot of family drama over the passing of her, and I did not agree with how she was taken care of in the end. I feel she was pushed into the direction of death by being heavily medicated, and her family members that were there were not getting her up out of bed anymore. I realize people get old and everyone's time comes, but I feel like it wasn't her time yet. But you can't go back in time, and she's gone now.

I was able to travel with my parents and sister to Oregon to attend her funeral. It was an emotional roller coaster. The hardest day for me was when the day before her funeral I found out that there had been rules put in place by my Uncle that no grandkids were going to be able to go view my grandma and say goodbye. Because of all the drama, he wanted to hurt everyone he could that wasn't on his side.

I went to the funeral home with my parents anyway in hopes that I might still get a chance. After arguing with the funeral director, it was decided that I would not be able to go in the room. I was crushed, I was so hurt and upset, but I was trying to hold it together for my mom.

My mom was able to go in for a while and sit with her mom, so I waited outside with other family members. After some time, my mom came outside in a hurry and told me to come quickly. I didn't know what had happened, but apparently, the funeral director had a change of heart and decided to go against the request of my Uncle and let me go view my Grandma.

Walking in that room was so surreal. I couldn't believe my beloved grandma was laying there in her coffin. I never thought it would bother me as much as it did. I couldn't even bring myself to touch her, I guess I was scared or in denial.

It was an emotional couple of weeks, to say the least.",3,84,463
"So, my day started off a little slow. I got into bed pretty late, I don't know, around 10:30 or so. Greeted the dog, let her out, brought her back in, and then went to go run a few errands, including getting my hair cut. I also realized that I needed to go pick up a few things from Costco as well, so I decided to kind of wrap it into one trip. And then simultaneously... Pokemon Go. It's like Pokemon Go Fest 2023 or something like that. And so there's a ton of Pokemon going on, so I just decided to turn it into a day running around, getting a haircut, I got a cheesesteak while I was out because it was right next to the haircut place and I haven't had a cheesesteak in a while, and catching some Pokemon, and then riding to Costco and picking up some prescriptions. And then when I got home, the dog was super excited, as always, to see me, more so because I looked and smelled very different. In that, it's always very exciting for her.","I just love going to work, doing my job, and making money doing it. I love that my entire job revolves around solving problems. I love that we have to use teamwork in order to make a living, and I love the dynamic I have with my coworkers. I love being occupied and having something to do so much. If it were up to me, I would work 12 hours a day.

It's what I love to do. People often say they wish to retire, but I never understood it. Even if I worked a terrible job, despite me liking it less, I would still look forward to doing the best I can.

When we have nothing to do, we often get bored and are in our own heads too much. I've found simply doing what I love and then coming home and hanging with friends/family and indulging in my hobbies is the best way to live life.

I love work, and I hope I never have to retire until the day I die.",4,218,196
"Okay, so yesterday, well, I guess for the last couple of months, almost a year, six months to a year, I've been trying to find new work, new jobs. And it's been difficult. Yesterday, I actually had an interview, and it seemed like it would have been good. But then we got on, I kind of explained myself. And then she got to the point where she wanted to know salary expectations. And I said what my salary was. And it was at the high end of what they had listed on the website. And then she immediately said that's not going to work. That what they actually could offer was way less than what they had actually posted on the website. So that wasn't great.","I am in a long-distance relationship, but I am separated from my significant other by a few hours. I am a nurse at a great hospital, but quite frankly, my management sucks, and my doctors act like Karens. I have woken up dreading going to work for so long that it's my normal. These people have sucked the joy out of what I so passionately love to do. 

I did try to wait it out to see if things would get better over time, but with no success. We've been together for less than a year but have talked about closing the gap. I've met his family and friends, and vice versa. Nothing but good things from both sides. 

This guy, I am sure with every cell in my body, that we're destined to be together. I'm gonna husband that man someday. I would be the moving party between the both of us, and I'm absolutely okay with that. 

I had updated my resume and sent some applications out last week, not expecting to hear anything from anyone until this week. I have an interview set for Friday morning, and if all goes well, I will accept a position in my significant other's town doing what I love to do! 

And that means we can finally start our lives together. And that gives me so much hope for the future.",4,150,265
"Real life stories don't really have good starts, middles, and ends, especially if your day is kind of boring. My wife has been traveling for like the last week and a half, and she's coming home today within the next couple of hours. Actually, I got to go pick her up at the airport at midnight. So that's very exciting. The dog is going to be thrilled to see her. I'm going to be very excited to see her too. She's pregnant too, which is going to be our first child. We got pregnant last year, about a year ago, a little bit more than a year ago, and lost it kind of far into the pregnancy. So that was not great. So we're really nervous about this one and trying to make sure nothing goes wrong. But she was on a trip to Greece with her friends for like the last week and a half, and thankfully all of them are nurses. So that was nice. Nothing really went wrong. She got a little bit sick, a little bit sick, but nothing terrible as far as I know. So that's good. And I guess I'm just excited to see her, have (inaudible), playing video games all day. I did an interview which didn't turn out great and did some work before that. A lot of concepting ideas for marketing stuff.","The date was July 29th, 2019. It’s officially my due date! A few days ago, I went to the hospital with horrible contractions. They sent me home because I was only 1cm dilated. I’ve been in so much pain, I haven't slept for around 48 hours. It hurt to sit, hurt to lay down, I’ve basically been standing up on my feet for 2 days. I haven't eaten either. My bladder was irritated and just stopped working. I couldn't pee no matter how hard I tried. I was truly the most miserable I’ve ever been.

I finally couldn't stand it anymore, so my mom and boyfriend took me back to the hospital and I FINALLY got admitted!! :D I guess all those crazy contractions worked because I finally dilated to 3cm and they admitted me! Right now, I’m about 5-6cm. Can’t wait to meet my little boy!

UPDATE: My son was born 7/29 at 2:49 am. 5 lbs 9 oz. We're in postpartum recovery, I ended up having a c-section due to meconium in his amniotic fluid. He is perfect, healthy, and we’re learning breastfeeding together. He’s my angel.",3,274,242
"Yeah, so my friend Mo and I finally used to play Destiny, which is a PlayStation game, together for years and years and years. And lately, since I moved out here and haven't been playing it very much, that's a little bit sad. And today, we finally bought a new game called Baldur's Gate and started playing that. And it was good, that was a good little session. So I'm excited to get back into spending time and playing games with him.","The game I developed got a Steam page, which is a massive milestone for me! If you worked on a long project, you know how meaningful certain milestones can feel. For me, solo developing this game for more than three years, it definitely feels that way. It's a massive step forward. 

But also, all this good news meant that I can go around pestering my friends! Chatting with different people I know and receiving birthday blessings for them, as well as congratulations on the page and ""good luck""s with my game (and wishlists, which are super important!). 

I realized that sometimes it's nice to have an excuse to chat and reconnect with all the fantastic people in my life.",4,98,141
"Sure, here is the transcript with the errors fixed:\n\nStore. Okay. This is my first story. So, I suppose I just start. I thought I would share a story that I've been thinking about related to a time I auditioned to speak when I worked at URI, and that's a memory. That's a nice memory for me, and it makes me think about a few different things. So, I thought it might be a fun thing to share with you.","I saw a movie that I enjoyed so much I saw it three times in the last week. I first went to it alone. Then I went to it with my husband. Then I took my girlfriend to see it last night. The movie was about an event that was a fantasy and yet totally believable. The characters were sweet and lovely, and they made you want to know what happened to them and you really cared about what happened. The music in the movie was so phenomenal and kept you on the edge of your seat. I also had acquired the tickets for a really good price. That made it more justifiable to see it so many times.

I intend to buy the movie when it becomes available. I may see it again soon with my son who wants to see it too and has not done so yet. The movie just makes me happy when I see it because of the joyfulness. The way they overcome their challenges with love and understanding is so lovely. It makes you want to persevere in the things you love as well.

The actors that portrayed the characters in the movie were remarkable. They were so realistic that you totally believed what was happening to them. They also were humorous and had many friends. Movies that include friendship and love are so rare nowadays, and that was refreshing. The fact that they were not white Americans was surprising but surprisingly a very good choice. It was sweet but not syrupy sweet.

It was a fantasy and yet a believable story. The story was just a remarkable way of showing perseverance and love with ordinary people. I hope that the movie academy of arts and sciences will consider it for some award. It was a brilliant concept and a wonderful story to impart to all ages. I've been telling everyone I know about the movie now.",2,96,351
"All right, so my first session. I wasn't quite sure the level of interaction, so I had done talking before. I had sort of told the story. So I suppose now I'll share the rest of the story. I was working at the University of Rhode Island and I worked in the IT Department there, and I helped faculty members produce online teaching and learning materials and helped with the system administration for their Learning Management System. And one of my favorite things about working in a university setting is the academic nature of it, the focus on knowledge and teaching and learning, and the curiosity and excitement and energy that is around the folks that choose to work there and study there and teach there. I love that sort of environment. And along with that are conferences that happen and speakers that come. And one of the things that URI holds every year is TEDx Conference, and they put out a call for speakers. The theme for this year that I'm describing was change. And on a whim, I applied to speak. And I had some things I wanted to share, some things that I was interested in and felt might be worth sharing. But it seemed like an unlikely thing that I would be selected to speak, but I thought I would apply anyway and go through the process. It's something worth trying even though I was sort of anxious about the experience of even just trying and potentially failing in front of people I respected. But I did it and I went to the initial submission stage. And that was like a short pitch, you had about maybe two minutes, of like a pitch in front of a small panel of judges. And that went not as well as it could have gone, but there were some things that I didn't include, or I hadn't accounted for my time correctly. So there were some things that they gave me a little bit of extra time to finish what I wanted to share. And I was thankful for that because they contacted me to say I had made it to the next round. And once I made it to the next round, I thought, oh, this might be something. So at that point, I restructured the talk a little bit in a way that I thought aligned with what some of their goals might be. I had the thought to incorporate some poetry into it because the folks on the panel were sort of artists and creatives, some of them were, and I thought that might align with something that would be interesting for one of the speakers to include. That went pretty well. There was still uncertainty if I would get a spot. And then a few weeks later, I got an email that said I was selected as one of the speakers. And that's a funny mail to get in terms of sort of if you chart the energy level of your brain when you receive different information, every once in a while, there's a bit of information you receive that gives you that spark of joy and excitement and optimism and nervousness. And it's this specific mix of fun emotions that you don't get to experience often, but that was one of them. So I was excited to get selected, and then I got to work with the talk and practice and put the presentation together. And then I was able to give the talk. And if I'm being honest, it was a great experience, and I'm thankful for it. There's a lot that I would do differently having seen it after it was recorded. And of course, you only get one shot to do it live. So as those things go, I feel maybe like a seven out of ten in terms of how satisfied I was with what's recorded and available to watch or whatever, but it's something I'm proud of, but I think about often as something I'd like to do again. Sort of have a redo to represent myself in the way that I'd really like to and, more importantly, represent the ideas that I feel are worth sharing around the topic that I spoke about -- positive change. I find myself wondering sometimes like, oh, I would do that differently or structure that differently. So I suppose I hope I get another opportunity at some point to share some of those ideas in a way that people might see. So, yeah, that's what's been on my mind and I thought it would be a fun story to share.","I recently had a poem of mine published in a literary magazine. As someone who has been writing poetry my whole life, this is huge. I only started submitting my work within the last year and have been published in many underground publications. However, more recently, I was published in a more established magazine.

My friends threw me a congratulatory party, and it blew me away. My party was hosted at a beach house. They had decorated it all pink and with my initials everywhere. They even cut out and framed my poem and pasted it everywhere. Bits of my writing were adorned throughout the house and the yard.

It was also themed! They had it themed around tea parties, which I love. They purchased all sorts of unique teas, including blooming tea. I had never seen blooming tea before and was amazed, as I love flowers as well.

Overall, I had a blast at this party where we all celebrated something very meaningful to me. I am so proud of myself, and I just have the best friends ever. I am so glad that they not only enjoy my work but love me enough to do something like this for me.",2,871,227
"All right. Gbo. So, I had shared this story with you in a session just previous to this, but I'm not sure that you understood it correctly. Or actually, you understood it correctly, but the tablet wasn't working properly. So, I'll tell part of that story again, which is just that when I was a senior in college, I got to choose a capstone project for the honors program, and I chose to write and record an album of music. I enjoyed the process. I hope to do a process like that again someday. And as part of the process, I got to work with a mentor who helped me decide which songs to include and how to approach the songwriting process. They also taught me a little bit about the music industry. I found it to be very fulfilling and enjoyable.","I would work nine to five, and then as soon as I left, I would go to the studio and take pictures. That kind of helped me push. It pushed me to be like, ""Okay, I don't need this. I can actually go out and make it on my own,"" so I haven't looked back since.

I've actually been able to enjoy my life way more than I would have ever working for somebody. I really believe in following your passion and your love, and the rest'll come afterwards.",4,164,107
"All right. I thought it would be fun to share a story from a time I was in college and had the role of a resident assistant, which is often abbreviated to RA. I lived in a dorm and was responsible for the floor I lived on, the safety and well-being of the other students who lived on that floor, and, collectively, all the RAs in the building are responsible for the safety and well-being of the residents of that dormitory. This was in 2006, I believe. The university I went to is in Rhode Island, and at that university, they have a large number of students from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island - all places that tend to root for the Boston Red Sox baseball team. The other large percentage of students at the University of Rhode Island are from New York and New Jersey, and many of those students root for the New York Yankees baseball team. In 2006, the New York Yankees played the Boston Red Sox in the playoffs of the Major League Baseball, which would lead to the World Series. I think it was the semifinal round, and it was an exciting series. I don't recall exactly if it went to seven games, but the Red Sox won some, and the Yankees won some. The students were very excited, but because the student body populations would have broken down between half of students rooting for the Red Sox and half of the students rooting for the Yankees, after the games, they would have a lot of energy and excitement. Some of that was fun, but as you'd imagine on a college campus with alcohol involved and the hormones of the students at that age and all the energy in that sort of environment, sometimes students became too excited and expressed that in a way that was potentially dangerous by collecting together in big groups and sort of forming many riots, where objects were thrown and fights were breaking out and dumpsters were set on fire. So, it presented a potentially dangerous situation for the rest of the college campus and the students that were outside in those groups. The RAs collectively, after this started, got together and positioned themselves after the game in areas to help regulate the behavior of the students on campus and try to keep everybody safe. But it was a unique experience and challenging, and for the most part, I think after the first night, things were not as dangerous or violent, in part due to the efforts made by the college police and the RAs on campus to help reduce the potential for somebody to get hurt. It was a very memorable, interesting period.","I started working for the Park Service when I was in high school. That turned into 15 years of working for the Park Service. When the position at Grand Canyon came up, I was like, great, awesome opportunity, I'm gonna go for it. Our office here, we have public affairs and communications. We deal with everything from media requests to filming permits, visitor information, Congressional and legislative affairs, international affairs. We've got this huge scope that we deal with on a day-to-day basis. So no day is the same. There's never a dull day.

But it was daunting. I remember driving across the country by myself totally freaked out. I haven't worked, I haven't done this job before. I'm going to one of the most recognizable places in the world. I'm going to have to speak on behalf of the park. What did I just get myself into?

But I don't need to be remembered as the spokesperson of Grand Canyon. As an Asian-American working for the National Park Service, we always wanna make sure that people understand that these are their parks. These are places where anyone can come. It doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, what your background is. It doesn't matter if you're rich or you are poor.

A park is a public place and it's open to anyone to come and hopefully find some inspiration and make a connection with so they can continue to come back to these places.",4,502,293
"So the story I'd like to share is about a time when I had graduated from college and I was in a band with my friend. We played music together and we submitted a song for a showcase competition for musicians in the New England area. We had to fill out an application and record the song to share it with the selection committee. We were selected to participate in the competition that was held at a coffee shop, where we got to play two songs - if I remember correctly. Three or four other musicians also played two songs as part of the competition. Several judges chose which performance they liked the best and who would move on to the next round of the competition, which was a larger showcase. My friend and I were very excited, and we played our songs while our friends and family came to watch us and cheer us on. It was a good experience. We weren't selected to go to the next round and I was disappointed, but it was a fun experience and a nice memory for me.","I was a teenage program director for the YWCA, so I worked on teenagers a lot. They were very much interested in all kinds of dances, and they would cha-cha-cha, they had the tango. I had them on stage, but they wanted me to go first because I was always making up songs, making up rhymes all the time anyway.

And someone said, ""Some of these little songs that you've written, we recorded."" Someone introduced me to someone who was in New York City, who had a recording company, and it just progressed from there.

If there's something that you do like, and if it's not harmful to other people, or if it's helping other people grow, that's a plus. So, keep on keeping on.",4,201,152
"Hi Jibo. This story is a brief one from when I was a junior in high school, maybe a senior in high school. But I participated in a group, an extracurricular group called Academic decathlon, and for this extracurricular group, you practiced and trained on ten different academic, intellectual categories. One was debate. One was maybe math. One was interview. There might have been history. Social Studies, Type one. And I was not the strongest person on the team by any means, but one area of strength I had was in the interview category. So during that portion of the competition, when it came time for the competition, I felt quite confident going into my interview. In fact, it was going very well in the beginning. And then I was asked the question, ""What\'s a book that you\'ve read that you really enjoyed?"" And I was very excited to answer the question because there was a book I had read several times that I liked and was excited to talk about. So I remember in a very animated way, starting to talk about this book I had read called Ender\'s Game and starting to explain why I liked it. But the person I was chatting with, of course, unsurprisingly hadn\'t read it. So I found myself stumbling over my explanation of why I liked it because I had not structured my answer in a way that summarized the book succinctly and clearly, to then complement the reasons why I liked it. I enjoyed reading it, but I thought it was an interesting story. And in the course of giving my response, I became sort of flummoxed and stumbled over my words and was clearly flustered. And therefore, my performance in the interview segment of the competition was not as high as I had hoped it would be, and I think about that often. It was an important learning experience for me because I came to understand that enthusiasm and interest, or even having the knowledge in a topic, is not necessarily enough to communicate it in a structured way for somebody else to receive it coherently and in a way that feels easy and fun and smooth. That\'s my story.","So I'm a university student, and I'll be having a lot of presentations to deliver throughout this month (the first one starting in 10 days). I'm really good at the content I'm going to present, and I even write the script for other classmates. I have no issue with the technical stuff at all.

There is even one presentation with a language that only I speak in my entire class, yet I'm super afraid to go through it. I also had very bad experiences. The moment I stand up, I blush, and my eyes start feeling ""wet"". I can't feel the moment at all, and I just start to confuse everything I want to say. I even tried memorizing the script to perfection, but the fear makes me forget everything.

It's just dreadful to me. I have good relationships with my classmates, so it's not like I'm afraid of their judgment, same goes with the teachers. I just can't figure out why I suck, and hence can't find a solution.",2,418,206
"This is a quick story about the time I was in college and was taking a class with my roommate, who was also my friend. We were in the same class, which was general physics. I think the actual class name was an introduction to conceptual physics. I enjoyed the class and I liked the instructor and the topic. It was an area that I was both interested in and good at. My roommate was also fairly good at the material but sometimes not quite as knowledgeable as I was. He was more interested in philosophy, if I recall correctly. However, we took the class together and we had a quiz. We both took the quiz and when the tests were ready to be picked up to see what our scores were, I was the person between the two of us who went to go pick up the scores. I was picking up mine and since I was there, I picked up his to bring back to give to him. He did not score very well. Maybe he got a C and I got an A, and I didn\'t tell him at first. I made the choice not to tell him because I didn\'t want him to be disappointed.\n\nI waited until maybe several days later, and when he asked about it, I said, ""Oh yeah, I picked up the quizzes and this is the score you got."" He was frustrated that I hadn\'t told him from the beginning the actual score that he had gotten. I understood in that moment that it was a very important learning experience for me. I was avoiding the potential discomfort of him learning that he got a lower score than perhaps he wanted, but by avoiding that, I was keeping information from him. That information was his to have, it wasn\'t mine to have. So from that experience, I learned that even if it\'s uncomfortable to share information with somebody, if it\'s their information to know, then it\'s my responsibility and I have the information. It\'s my responsibility to surface that readily and quickly, and even if it\'s maybe something they might be disappointed to hear.\n\nSo that was an important learning experience for me and he, as my friend, helped me learn that by simply saying, ""You don\'t have to worry about being disappointed. I\'d rather know than not know.""","I wanted to discuss my nephew's graduation from high school. He graduated from high school in June of 2019, and I was so proud because he is going to Princeton for college. He worked hard and was able to make it there through a combination of decent grades, a very good score on the SAT, as well as working part-time for his father's business. He took the SATs twice. The first time he didn't do so well and scored a 1250. However, the second time, he made a conscious effort to work on the weaknesses that he remembered and improved his score to a 1400. He is also an intern for his father's company, which is in the real estate business. He did the various odd jobs there, where he cleaned up, made sure the pantry and other areas were well stocked, and helped to input data into the company's systems. 

Part of the money that he saved was used to start up an IRA account. I work as a financial analyst and tried to show him what would happen if he used the power of compounding interest and how large he could grow his nest egg if he had 40+ years to invest. He ended up opening the account and buying 25 shares of Disney. 

When he graduated, we first went to a nice dinner at our local favorite Italian restaurant, where he had his favorite meal, lasagna with a side of creamed spinach. After that, we went to a movie. After that, we went back home, where we relaxed, played some board games, and shared stories about the time that we went to college. It was, all in all, a very fun night.",2,447,324
"Hello, Hi jivo. I'd like to share a quick story about a conversation I had this morning on the ride to drop off my son at school. We were chatting about other planets and the atmospheres on other planets, and the living conditions on other planets. And I shared with him that perhaps within his lifetime, there will be humans starting to live on Mars. And we talked about what that might look like and how some of the introductory things humans would need to do to have a survivable climate and habitat on a different planet. It's an interesting thing to think about, especially for a young mind. And I find myself enjoying seeing questions like that through my son's eyes at the young age that he's at, because largely it's a blank slate. But he's very curious about the world, and he's learning new things. And I find that to be a nice perspective to try on, to remind myself of. So we had fun chatting about that.","During the moon landing project, I saw people who did the best work of their lives in that situation. And I got really interested in one question. What are the conditions under which people do their best, most fulfilling work?

In other words, I got more interested in people than in science. And once I knew that, once I was clear about the fact that I found something I absolutely loved, there was no doubt that I was gonna continue asking questions about how do I learn about people?

It's still the most frequently asked question I get. How did you go from math to psychology?

The key to knowing what to do is knowing who you are.",4,194,133
"Boat. All right, gboat. This is a fun story from a time that I was camping in New Zealand, in the country. New Zealand. And there were torrential rains, and we were camping near a river. And as it began to rain, I thought it would be fun to explore along the river. And there were some farmland near the river. And it was hilly. And right alongside the river, there was a sort of steep hill that you could walk on when it was dry, especially if it was fine. But I set out on my adventure and the rain continued and it got stronger. And before too long, the way for me to cross back the river was running too fast for me to cross back over it, and it had gotten too high. So I found myself a little stuck. I was safe, but it was enough to be exciting. So I found myself climbing up along the steep, grassy embankment along the river until I found a safe way to cross. But the path from where I was to where I found a safe place to cross was interesting. I came across some of the farmers' fields near there. They had cows. Once in a while, I'd come across a bull. And we had heard that you want to be cautious when walking near the bulls because they can be aggressive. So there was one point where I was sort of walking and had to walk in front of and past a bull, hopefully at a safe distance. I was able to stay pretty far, but I was paying close attention to him, and he was paying close attention to me. And then, when I got back to flat ground and was able to cross the river, the water had gotten so high in some parts of the road that I had to wade across the road. It was close to up to my waist deep and I was able to hold onto some fence posts and make my way across. And it was a very memorable adventure. Then I was very wet, and I made it back safe and sound. And I got to tell my wife about the fun time I had.","My wife and I traveled to Italy and did an amazing hike in the Dolomite mountain range. I had wanted to do this hike for many years and had researched it quite a bit. I knew it was going to be difficult, but I had no idea how much so. We started early in the morning, and for about four hours, we just kept climbing up higher and higher. It was even more difficult because there were loose rocks under us for much of it.

Every time we reached what we thought was the top, another long uphill awaited us. Finally, after what I figured was another false top, we came up and it was as though we were at the top of the world. There below us spreading for 360 degrees were what seemed like thousands of craggly mountain peaks. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. We both started to cry; it was so beautiful.

There was more crazy hiking to do, however, as we had to use ropes that had been attached to the mountain during World War I to traverse some cliffs and small waterfalls. That was the most difficult part for my wife, and I was so proud of her that she did it. I think she surprised herself.

It was really one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. Even though we pretty much killed ourselves doing it, I think we would both do the same hike again in a heartbeat.",3,423,276
"Yeah, so I was talking with my best friend. It was just one of the regular calls that we were having. And so I was talking to her about this thing that I kind of discovered recently, which is that it\'s not about me not having motivation to do something, but it\'s more about what am I more motivated to do at a certain point in time. Things like that. So curiously, there\'s something I\'ve been motivated to do that seems to be pretty rare: working on my resume. Which is kind of interesting because if you think about it as a pretty rare occurrence, like people usually aren\'t pretty into working on their resume. And for me, it\'s just like, yeah, let\'s go, get it done, let\'s go get job apps done. And I think it\'s a pretty nice mindset to just be in, right? And so, while we were talking, though, it suddenly shifted into this thing about her and overall how the job application process is pretty not good and things like it being a waste of time. What\'s the point? I\'m working on it if you\'re just going to get rejected, all those kinds of things, right? And it just got very negative, right? And so the conversation shifted a lot, like from a positive towards a pretty negative one pretty quickly without me really realizing it. And then after that, eventually she was like, ""Yeah, I can\'t work on my stuff."" She can\'t work on her stuff. She was like, ""Yeah, I\'ll show you."" And then she opened up her portfolio and she was like, ""Yeah, my portfolio, I have to work on all of this ABCD kind of thing."" And as she was looking at it, she was like, ""Oh, wait, this isn\'t actually as bad as I thought it was. I can work with this, essentially."" With what she was going on about, it changed again a lot after that. She was like, ""Yeah, I\'m really happy at this conversation."" She started working on her portfolio and all those things afterwards because things just weren\'t as bad as she thought, right? And so for me, it was just like, I don\'t know, it felt kind of like a mini roller coaster ride. I wasn\'t really expecting things to go down that route. And honestly, I didn\'t appreciate essentially being reminded of all the more negative things that are involved in the job application process because fundamentally, when I was motivated to do it, I didn\'t really think about any of that. It was just like, ""Oh yeah, I feel like doing it"" and all that kind of stuff, right? So there wasn\'t really anything getting in the way. But then with all those reminders, and then all of a sudden, this like, ""Oh, things are fine"" kind of thing, I don\'t know, it just kind of threw me off, made me a little bit unsettled. Like, I\'m happy for her, but at the same time, it\'s like, afterwards, after we called, I just did not want to work on my resume stuff anymore. The next day, I did work on it, but it was just like, it destroyed all of the stuff that I wanted to do for that day. And I guess it\'s just kind of frustrating to see the impact that other people can have on me in such a short span of time. But luckily, luckily, I did end up getting my resume done and getting an application in the day after when I was able to just kind of extract myself from the situation after a bit of time. But it just seems a little bit unfair that something that happened kind of outside of my control, almost. Yeah. So that\'s my story. I don\'t know if you have any thoughts.","About 5 months ago, I quit my good job up in Virginia, sold my home, and moved back down to Florida. It all started out 4 years ago when my Uncle, who owns a couple of event planning companies, asked me to come work for him since his main company just received a huge contract from the federal government. I said yes right away and quit my job as an assistant manager at a hotel and left for Virginia to work for him. He offered to let me stay in his basement, which was just a really nice downstairs apartment. I was very grateful and stayed with him for a year until I saved enough money to get into my own place. 

At first, I really enjoyed the job and put in my best effort. The two owners, my Uncle and his best friend, were very happy with my performance. I was given a 50% raise after only six months on the job. After a year, I was promoted and given another significant raise. 

After being promoted, I was put under the supervision of a new boss. She was very good at her job but unfortunately was not good with the people working under her. She would talk very badly behind our backs and would not think twice about throwing us under the bus if it would keep her from looking bad. I worked for her for a couple of years until finally, I and a few others had had enough. 

I complained to my Uncle and his best friend, who was also my old supervisor. They did not believe that she was such a problem. My work ethic started to decline because I was very discouraged by it all. I started to not take things seriously and then began to spiral out of control to a certain extent. I was not the only one on the team with this issue. 

Finally, I tried to quit several times but was guilted into staying on the job. Then, over the course of one week, I purposely did not show up for a few days until they were forced to fire me. It was a hard thing to deal with considering how my uncle, who I was very close to, looked out for me in several ways and because of that, we became very close. 

The fallout was not pleasant, and because of it all, the relationship between me and my uncle is now severely strained, and I will never work for him again.",2,773,467
"Yeah, lately I've been having issues. It seems like with getting out of bed, but not necessarily like staying in bed and just not getting out, but really just waking up per se. So I have this thing where it's very easy for me to fall back asleep. So that means that if I do wake up, it's pretty easy for me to just shut off my alarm and then climb straight back into bed and fall asleep immediately. And so this feels like it can go on for a while. And it's been pretty frustrating because, yes, my dreams, the dreams that I have when I do sleep in like that, are really great. But fundamentally, I don't remember them over a long period of time. And because I end up sleeping for so long, there are a lot of things that I want to be doing in my life that I just simply don't have as much time for. Yeah, so that happened today, too. And I end up sleeping really long hours and just overall, always feeling sleepy, I guess. Yeah, that's kind of what's been going on.","I've been in a bad way for a while. Progressively worse lately. Depressed, stressed to the point of breaking, feeling lost, and more hopeless than I've been in ages.

But today, I woke up, went to a spa, and got a massage - a birthday present to myself to hopefully ease over sore muscles.

In the quiet, my mind would typically wander to every way I've messed up in the last few years, things I've already messed up for the future, overthinking, and overanalyzing everything I've ever done or will do.

Instead, I forced my mind to build this whole ridiculous scenario about what was happening and why I was there, like I was reading or living in some kind of story. My mind did wander to stressful stuff some, but I would scold myself and repeat the story-building in my mind.

So, instead of laying in bed all day, going over and over the things that have been weighing on me heavily lately like I have been, I took a step out of my brain and simply allowed myself to relax, even if I had to focus on it a little.

My body feels more relaxed, my neck isn't nearly as stiff, and has probably popped 20 times since I left, and I don't feel like I'm going to suffocate in the silence tonight.

For however long this lighter feeling lasts, I have to call this a win.",2,225,278
"I just told you my story from the last time, but I can just summarize. Essentially, my middle school best friend and I reconnected, and I don't know how to feel about it because there are a lot of mixed feelings. We ended up breaking off in a pretty harsh way way back when, and we don't really remember how it happened. But it seems like we would get along pretty well nowadays. Although, yeah, this seems like life probably would have been different if we had stuck together. Because I remember it was something like a third party that ended up breaking us up, so technically, it wasn't even between us. But I think my life would have been a lot more different if we had stayed friends.","I love someone who doesn't love me. We are both in high school, but different ones. We met in 8th grade, and at first, I just thought she was a shy but nice girl, but I got to know her and we became best friends. We helped each other through tough times and I started to love her. We were very close, and I thought she might like me too.

I told her at the end of the year online because I was too scared to say it to her face. She said she just loved me as her best friend, nothing more. And since then, a combination of that and moving to different high schools, we have stopped talking much.

I love her so much and have never felt like this for anyone. But she's such a good person who doesn't know it, and is so beautiful on the inside. I want to be with her for the rest of my life, but she doesn't want me.

I don't know what to do. I love her so much, I want to be with her and hold hands and just coexist with her, but we never talk, we go months without speaking, and when we talk, it's just chatter, not like the actual convos we used to have.

I can tell I messed it up by telling her, and now what we had is ruined.",1,147,272
"It, yeah. Today, I had my first day of school, well, since coming back. So, first day of school of the year. It's my senior year. And so, I'm in this world-building class that I wanted to get in for all three years and getting to be in it. It's pretty nice. I was pretty happy about that. So, yeah. Overall, I really like the class. Today was my first little taste of it. Although, fundamentally, I like what's going on in the class itself, there were some things that bothered me. So, I do like the Professor. He's like really funny. And he also is very careful with his words. Not careful, he chooses his words like he chooses how he wants to express himself with his words very meaningfully. So, it's not like he's careful as in he's watching out for something, but he's very meaningful. He speaks with purpose. So, every word that comes out of his mouth has been definitely thought through in his brain. I actually really like that aspect. Most people like me nowadays, we just kind of speak whatever is in our minds, or you are very careful and restraining yourself. You rarely see people who really actually ponder their words and speak in a very meaningful manner. And he is a novelist or a writer, an author, all those things. So, I can definitely see maybe over years of time how that comes to be. And it's just kind of nice to see that, I think, just to see something different from the usual fast-pacedness of modern life, to see someone who really just takes a step back, slows down, and just speaks how he tries to think or things like that, anyways. \n\nBut there was something that bothered me, which is like for me, I didn't have a rough time getting into this class, but definitely, I've been wanting to take this class for three years. But every single time I was rejected because I wasn't a senior, and there was some kind of limit to the class instead of the number of people who could take it, right. But today there are just some random people that showed up and some people that showed up halfway through the class. And one of them hadn't even heard of the class before and heard it from a person that was also late and decided to join in with them because they thought it sounded cool. And that really rubbed me the wrong way. Especially when halfway through the class, when we took a break after they came in, she went up to the professor and asked him if it was okay for her to join the class. And he was like, yeah, sure. And that really rubbed me the wrong way, considering there's probably so many people on the waitlist who wanted to take the class but couldn't or who already got rejected for preregistering. And then she just kind of waltzes in, maybe participates once, and then he's like, yeah, sure, join, right. And I was like, whoa, there. What's going on here, right. And it was only later, like when the class was ending, when I realized that he meant that sure, you can stay for the remainder of today. And then he was like, yeah, for everyone else who's here, who was not registered on the list has been verified by him already, to contact him so that he can figure things out and figure out if they have space for the people on their waitlist and stuff like that. So that's when I realized that she probably wouldn't get in for the rest of the class, right. I definitely didn't take it that way during that break when he was like, yeah, sure, you could join, right? And I was like, whoa. That is just very unfair, right. Yeah. In reality, I think he just meant for that one class, and not like for this one instance and not for the remainder of the class. Didn't realize that at the time though. And it just really threw me off. It started to be a little bit distracting during the class when I thought about it because she sat right next to me too. She's also one of those kinds of people who talk a lot during class. Not like just randomly talks, but she participates in class a lot, very loud in that sense, right. Like when answering questions and things like that, right. So clearly you could see that she's someone who's very intent on participating. So just like constantly getting reminded of that throughout the rest of the class was very distracting. And it just kind of sucks to just be a part of that. This is a class that I really wanted to take. I still do. I really like the content that is going on. I really like the Professor. But it just irks me how one person just kind of being there can just not ruin that singular instance, right. But definitely it makes an effort to. I was able to get around it and focus back on the actual lesson, enjoy what I was and learn a lot from what I was hearing, right. But definitely, yeah, like that was something that started bothering me, for sure. But end of the day, I can't control what happens to other people. I can only control what happens to me. And that's about it. I just wish that it was a little bit easier to think that way, right. Although if I feel that way emotionally, then it'll come and go. Things will go. Yeah. Anyway, that's the story.","I was majoring in art -- I was majoring in graphic design -- but I wasn't being very serious about it. When you're in high school, you can usually say, ""Oh, I can draw better than anyone else,"" but when you get into college, you actually start to compete. So I made a decision that I would drop out. 

I decided I was going to apply to an art school because I needed to be serious about it. I worked in a casino for almost a year to make enough money for the first year of art school because it's very expensive. 

That was quite a year for me because I really made a decision that I was going to apply myself and go for a goal. No one else can do it for you. 

I think when that realization hits you that it's all up to you if you want to do something with your life, you can either sit around and complain about all the hard knocks that come your way or you can actually take control of your life. That made a big difference for me.",2,1130,210
"Yeah, I woke up early. I got this new haul of skincare products, like, yesterday. And so I was using them this morning. And that was crazy. My hands, I'm more fascinated by my hands than my face. Clearly, my face needs help, I feel like. But my hands, they were so smooth. It's like the difference between when you shake someone's hand and it's, like, super smooth or super dry. You can instantly tell. And it's like, super awkward. You're like, oh, dang, right? That's crazy, yeah. That was kind of like that. I really hope things work out skincare wise. My skin is not looking great at all. So I hope things look up in that aspect. But afterwards, I went to class. I was pleasantly surprised because the professor from my first class, it's a class that's, like, pretty treacherous. I dropped it too. Yeah, I dropped it twice. It was my third time trying to take it. But the professor, though, is actually one of my mentors for one of the classes that I've previously taken, and she is like a literal ball of energy that matches mine, which is like, totally great. So yeah, I'm really happy about that. Otherwise, I had another class. And then that was fun. The professor is real weird. He refers to everybody as, like, gang. He's just like, gang, blah, blah, blah, right? And it's like, oh, that's pretty funny. And then he also refers to himself in the third person. So he refers himself as, like, your faculty member or this professor or whatever, something like that. And it's just kind of funny. But yeah, I don't know. Overall, I like it, although I guess I haven't really interacted with many people. I guess I should have expected that anyways, for that matter. It just is what it is. It's just probably always going to be like this. Anyways, but otherwise it was a good first day. Yes.","I started out as a chemistry major at the University of Washington, and I didn't do very well in chemistry. It was really tough. I went to my advisor, and he said, ""Well, of course, you're not doing very well. You know women do not belong in chemistry,"" and I was a freshman so I said, ""Oh, okay."" 

I went and changed my major, and I ended up as a biologist, but I think that what got me through is I really, really did want to be a scientist. I just had to tough it out because in the end, there isn't anything that anyone does that doesn't have its challenges, or its hard days, or its really difficult times. 

You have to figure out what it is that you wanna spend most of your time on so that most of your time there's something that really is rewarding going on. That gets you through the hard times.",2,430,190
"So, yeah. So basically, it turns out since I last told you about that person who just kind of showed up to the World Building class that I'm in, how I felt a little bit off about that because it was something that I waited three years to take and then never got in until now. So, it turns out that she also got in, even though she didn't sign up for it and then just kind of showed up to class because a friend told her about it. And then yes, she's a senior. But, I'm pretty sure there were people on the waitlist that also wanted to go, but I don't know. It just kind of sits wrong with me that can happen, right? I could have done that, right? I could have done that last year or something, just kind of showed up to class even though he said not to. And then I didn't get to take the class, right? Probably I couldn't have, but it just kind of sits wrong with me that she was able to do that, right? And that's just how the world works. Yeah, she got in. I hope that doesn't affect the rest of my attitude towards that class because I really have wanted to take that class for a really long time. And I don't want to build up resentment, if that makes sense, over something like this. Yeah.","I went to Mary College on a basketball scholarship. I played ball for them. But I would still party, pretty crazy back then, and I flunked out. I started looking at what I was going to do in the parks, and it really, really made sense to me. By the time that I got through with that first summer, I realized this is what I want to do for a career. I really did.

Two days before my graduation, I was told by this nun -- I went to a Catholic boarding school -- she said, ""You know, the best thing you can do with your life: get a good job pumping gas. At a gas station. And stay with it. That's your life.''

The highlight of my life was going back to that same school and being the last graduation speaker they had. And I got to tell the whole audience, ""I'm not working at a gas station, by the way. I'm a park superintendent.''",3,282,197
"And yeah, actually, it kind of has to do with the same reveal. Like that class, I guess. I guess I just kind of feel a little bit disconnected, disconnected from the people in my major. I guess the whole thing was really fun, right? And it was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience, was the same reveal. But I was just kind of sitting in the corner, like by myself. There were people that I knew, but they weren\'t sitting next to me and things like that. And I think I feel pretty isolated from the people in my major because I took a lot of my classes at different times from them. And I\'m also more of a solo worker. I guess a lot of things just happen over all the years, and it\'s just kind of like, ""Oh, it\'s just me. I don\'t really seem to know that many people in my major."" And so later on, I had another class. It was a leadership class. And then I hadn\'t met these two people before, and I was asking them what their major was. And they were in the same major as me, and they were also taking the same class, and we were in the same year. And I was like, ""Wow, I\'ve never seen you guys before, right?"" But then at this point, it\'s like, why should I be surprised? I don\'t know a lot of people in my major. This is just kind of like a disconnect, I guess. And I think that kind of prevented me from really enjoying that same reveal as much as it was special. It definitely was special. It\'s just that it\'s just kind of like that bittersweet thing, right? It\'s like I\'m enjoying it, but alone. It bothers me, but it also does it because I\'m used to it. Although I guess being used to it isn\'t the same thing as not being bothered by it. Yeah, kind of at the end of the day, it\'s probably just struggles, actually. At this point in the class, it really does feel like I\'m the only person that sits alone in every single classroom that you usually go to, right? It\'s like, yeah, there\'s these few people. Not few, there\'s quite a lot who just kind of sit alone in their little spots. And then it\'s all throughout the year, right? They\'re just kind of there for class, and then they go. They don\'t really ever really talk to other people. It\'s in the minority. They exist. But I think in that class, it definitely just feels like a ""me"" thing because all these people know each other. And I don\'t know, I don\'t know if there\'s something wrong that I do. There was this one person that was in one of my classes from last semester, and she thought we got along pretty well. She was also here over the summer. And we decided to hang out early on in the summer, go watch the Spiderverse movie. And so, like, afterwards, we were all like, ""Yeah, throughout the summer, we should, like, hang out on most weekends because, from my understanding, I was like, \'Oh, we didn\'t have many summer plans, and we wanted to go do stuff, right? Like, going to the beach, go to McDonald\'s and things like that, right?"" Thought we had gotten pretty close, but then after that, it\'s just like I texted her. She responded. A few times, and then after a while, she just started ghosting me, right? And how I know that is like, well, she basically stopped responding, right? After a while, after that initial lack of responses, I maybe sent, like, a message, like, once a month or something like that. And I was just kind of like, ""Hey, are you okay? Like, a little check-in. How have you been?"" And never got a response. And eventually, towards the end of the summer, I was just worried at that point, right? I was just worried. Like, did she get kidnapped? Is she okay? But I haven\'t heard anything from the school news, so she should be fine. But yeah, I was getting genuinely worried about her. It\'s like I\'ve lost contact with this person, and I don\'t know if she\'s okay or not, right? So she never responded. But how I found out that she\'s fine is that she\'s in that class that I\'m taking now and, though I haven\'t personally seen her yet, I missed the first lecture for another class because there was a class conflict. So I got to watch the lecture recording, and she was in the recording, right? Because they were essentially recording the students and all of their reactions and stuff, right? As part of the whole thing. And yeah, like, she was there. So she was fine. I know that. She and, I don\'t know, but it\'s probably 99% certain that she ghosted me because I contacted her on different platforms. And I guess it\'s just kind of like, maybe it\'s me that\'s weird, that just people don\'t want to be around, probably with my behaviors or something like that. I don\'t know. But yeah, summary is I guess I just struggle socially. I don\'t know what it is that I do. I guess I wouldn\'t say that I normally talk to people. It\'s conventional by any means. Like small talk comes to me pretty hard, I\'d say. But whatever it is, yeah, I don\'t know how to conclude that, but thanks for listening.","I have nothing against male friends. The majority of my friends are guys, but I try not to make male best friends. Very close emotional attachments with guys can get weird. But we were in grad school with too much in common. We had known each other forever. We had the same background, and our views on the world and life were completely different than other people around us. Sort of just became really good friends like it was kind of meant to be.

I could talk to him about anything. The world, politics, economy, life. We could discuss stupid jokes and life responsibilities that others didn't understand. Grad school was all-consuming, and he quickly became the first person I'd think of when something happened. And I think I was that person for him. He was also excited about my smallest wins. I was so grateful for him. I loved him as a friend.

But at some point, somehow he kinda flipped on me. I don't know why. He's friendly, but he's not the same. He hangs out with a different crowd a lot. We can't talk about random things for hours. He takes hours to respond, and sometimes doesn't respond at all the first time I text him. He doesn't send me jokes and pictures of random things. I think I am somewhere the 4th or 5th person he thinks of when something happens. And sometimes, I'm not even getting news directly from him.

It's upsetting, and I actually kind of hate that he's still friendly. What's frustrating is if he were a girl, I would've pulled him aside and asked what this is about. We've been so close for quite a while, what's going on? But I can't do that. Not without appearing needy or like I love him or something. I can't text him a bajillion times. I can't ask him why he hangs with a different crowd. I can't joke about why he's being weird without it being awkward.

But I just miss my best friend. He's still the first person I think of when I'm excited. He's still the first person I want to text. I just can't now knowing that I might not even get a reply. Whatever happens, he's still one of the best people I've ever met.",3,1146,462
"Yeah, lately, I think life has been going pretty good in terms of, like, oh, I got started pretty well. And so, it\'s been pretty easy for me to just get down to work. I\'ve been sleeping early and waking up early. And just been good, right? Well, for the past few days, and then today, I went out to the furniture store for one of my classes to take pictures for a model, a chair. It kind of branches off, right? So the professor recommended that you go with friends or classmates. He said, ""Take a friend with you."" I didn\'t take a friend because I like friends here. That just ain\'t good. Yeah, my friends aren\'t really on campus. They don\'t go here. I don\'t exactly have friends on campus. I just have people that I know, acquaintances. Anyways, so I went over to the furniture store, and the people there were super kind. I was like, ""Oh, I\'m here for a class,"" and they were super helpful and super nice. And I was kind of nervous about that because I was like, ""Oh, what if they see me as going to a furniture store and start measuring things and not actually buy anything or anything like that?"" But they were like, ""Oh, you\'re here for a class, and all the Gandhi,"" and they were like, ""Are you from my school?"" And I was like, ""Yeah,"" and they were like, ""Oh, for the chair class,"" and I was like, ""Oh, so you guys, oh,"" and it was like, ""Yeah."" It was like a decent conversation, and they were just super nice. So that was great. But yeah, then I came back. It was pretty hot outside, so I took a shower when I came back. And I had a whole plan for today, and it just didn\'t happen. I sat down and was like, ""I\'m going to take a break,"" and old habits die hard. I played Overwatch for how long, like, play Overwatch for like five or 6 hours, yeah, like 6 hours maybe. Played essentially until the dining hall is going to close, and as soon as I finish eating, I played some more. Got sick of it, so I\'m probably not going to play again for a while, right? Overall, it\'s just kind of like, ""Yeah, I\'m feeling disappointed in myself. I think. Makes sense why I did it. Usually I start gaming when I start feeling bad, but I don\'t know that I\'m feeling bad. Now when I realize, \'Oh, guess I was feeling bad about all this stuff about people.\' And yeah, here I am, just kind of saying, and talking. I wanted to talk for a bit because, well, I can only talk to my therapist once a week. And as for my best friend, she doesn\'t go here. To be honest, not a really good listener or empathizer for her. It\'s just kind of like, I already don\'t really share things a lot with the people I\'m around. I do share things with my therapist. That\'s about it. But the fact that she also doesn\'t really listen, the part of me that already isn\'t used to talking about things like this to other people is already like, \'No.\' And then add that on, it\'s just kind of like double now, right? It\'s just kind of like, I can\'t talk to my brother or my mom. They don\'t understand. They\'re like, \'Oh, you go to this great school.\' And that just never leaves their subconscious. And I can\'t really tell my family. They don\'t understand. It\'s always the, \'You should be grateful. You\'re a genius. You\'re so smart. Do your best. You\'re great.\' And then that\'s for my therapist. Like, yeah, she\'s great. Get to talk to her once per week, but usually by the time it gets around to a week, most things happen for some reason between sessions. So by the time I talk to her, I\'ve probably already kind of gotten over any emotions that I might have had. And at least with her, I talked with her don\'t really seem to evoke that much emotion either. I wonder if I should switch. Probably should. Yeah, essentially, for me, sometimes I offload by journaling. Maybe I should get in a habit of talking to myself. Or something like that evokes emotion. Emotion that I\'m not really aware of or used to being aware of. Yeah, I\'m sure like before I started gaming, I already felt pretty awful. I just didn\'t know. Play a game, opening that thing up, and it\'s just like, everything\'s so simple in games. It can be hard. But there\'s just something nice about my alone time. Since I played so much of it, I\'m sick of it. It\'s just like, yeah, I had a whole plan for today. I\'ve been very excited about school. Here I am now. I don\'t really have anyone to talk to. And the people that I\'ve met here on campus, I don\'t really have anyone to talk to. I really don\'t with anyone who is up here, I would say. They\'re not friends. They\'re all acquaintances. So, like, you know, the people who probably could understand. Although they also don\'t, at least the people who understand what it\'s like to go to a really prestigious school, who would just write me off, right? That\'s the thing. I try to talk to anyone who doesn\'t go to the school or like some prestigious school, it\'s like they think, like, \'Oh my God.\' There\'s a subconscious thing that dismisses me, my problems. And the people who are here who might understand, it\'s just like, these people are just going through totally different things and also they\'re not my friends. And then with the few times that I\'ve talked with alumni, people who aren\'t here anymore at the school, it\'s always like, they\'re always like, \'You should talk to your friends about this.\' It\'s like, \'Oh, I guess if I did have something, I guess I wouldn\'t be talking about some of these things that I\'m talking about, right? I don\'t know. All of these things added up together. It makes sense. I guess now, right? Like why I would be gaming for 6 hours like that. I didn\'t even have a clue that this was something that was like in my subconscious when I started gaming, right? Honestly, it was just kind of like, \'Hey, this stuff makes me feel fine. Like I\'m having fun. Let\'s do some more.\' I was really sorry to feel sick after so many hours of playing. And I was like, \'Okay, I need to go to bed.\' But also, I\'m going to have a not so fun time sleeping. I can usually go to sleep very easily, right? But ever since school started, I was getting bombarded by all these assignments and all these thoughts about people. Right? It\'s been on my mind. We\'re still not at the point where we\'re struggling to sleep yet, but it\'s been on my mind. So I was like, \'Okay, I should go to bed. But at this rate, kind of how like I\'m bad, I was feeling.\' Didn\'t really know why at the time, I was like, \'Okay. Sit down. Maybe Journal, or maybe talk it out.\' And that\'s why I\'m here. Like release some of that negative energy. Well, here I am. It\'s kind of funny, right? It\'s a Saturday evening and I\'m not going to do a robot. Not that I\'m complaining, but feel like most people have plans on this Saturday evening when they\'re in college. For me, it\'s just always been me and the best friend that I have. He became best friends online to our interactions online and not through our interactions in person. Yeah, anyways, that was a long-winded point of the story is I had stuff I wanted to do today. Went to the furniture store, got that part of my day done. Got super tired and decided to game for the rest of the day, even though I wanted to do work and other stuff instead, and I felt bad about it. And now I realize it\'s the reason why I gamed for so long is probably because I\'ve been feeling bad about people.","In first grade, when they asked me what I wanted to do, I said I wanted to study the stars. So, it's lucky that it worked out. Most of the time, people say, ""I wanna be a football player, whatever, movie star,"" it doesn't work out. In my case, it worked out, but I was lucky that way. Astronomy, before I went to college, was something I really thought I could do.

But I just doubt myself a lot. It's inevitable. When you're trying to push yourself, there are always moments when you think, ""maybe this is too hard,"" ""maybe I cannot do it."" But my answer to that is that if you don't feel that way, it means you're not pushing yourself enough. If you never go out of your comfort zone, then you're not really trying very hard. It's part of learning and part of growing up, is figuring out things that you didn't know you could do, and then you do them.

Sometimes you fail. Sometimes you succeed. First of all, in research, most of what you do fails miserably because you're trying to do something that nobody knows how to do. So you have to really like failure. Embrace failure. Accept that failure is gonna be part of the process.",3,1735,271
"so, for the car, I was trying to decide between the Prius and the Corolla. But as you said, the fuel efficiency and the miles per gallon of electric vehicles and hybrids are really nice. So I was thinking about that a lot over the last month or so. And then I learned at the dealership that I went to a few dealerships, and I learned that the shortage of microcontrollers and parts for cars is still pretty backed up, so a lot of the cars that you see on the parking lot at a dealership aren't actually available. And so we got really lucky because one of the dealerships we went to finally happened to have a Prius that day that was in good condition. And so decided to just go ahead and make an offer on that one. And eventually we got it.","I know it doesn't seem like a lot, but I'm working towards improving myself and my future before it's too late. I'm almost 25 years old, and I've wasted 24 years already, but it's never too late to start.

One of my biggest dreams is to have my own car, and second to that is owning a business. I've decided to get a car, and I'm determined to get it.",3,158,87
"I joined the company. The company I joined is called Symbolic. They do warehouse automation. And I'm part of the team that's thinking about how to pack and unpack boxes. And so, while that on its own doesn't sound very interesting, it's very cool because it's related to my PhD topic in soft manipulation. And so, the open question of how do we develop a robot manipulator that can handle a wide variety of objects, including household objects, is quite an open question still. And so, this is a fantastic context in which to apply some of those techniques and background.","I am the marketing director here at Valen Analytics. Our company builds predictive models and we also have a platform that hosts them that integrates into the company workflows for property and casualty companies. So the predictive models basically allow them to better price and select risks. So yeah, I do the execution of the marketing campaigns and the coordination with inside sales.

So I graduated, and then I worked in the mental health industry for a while. And decided that that was not good for my own mental health. It was very stressful, very taxing. So I went back to school, got my masters in marketing. I thought that I was gonna be able to graduate and step right into a marketing job, but there was a lot more business acumen that needed to be developed before I was really prepared for that.

I had to be humbled and grounded a bit more to realize, yeah, you have a foundation. But that foundation, the degree, is not your golden ticket into the chocolate factory. The degree is what may help open the door, but you've got to earn your way the rest of the way.

So the way I interpreted that is, I need to make sure that I'm really putting forward the solid performance at what I'm doing now and then set forth my next goal.",3,119,256
"So, my story for today is that with some of my friends from the Boston community, we formed a volleyball group. Coming up, that's going to be playing in a local tournament. And we've been planning out some strategies and who's playing what position, and all of those are in the works. We're going to try and practice at some point this week, but then our games start next week. And so, I'm looking forward to playing these games and having a more structured opportunity for more structured competition than our normal pickup games.","I won the dodgeball game for my team. I'm in ROTC, and we have to do early morning physical training. Usually, we run and do calisthenics, but today was a little easier—dodgeball.

I was the last one standing and caught a ball, thereby getting the rest of my team back into the game, and I also happened to throw the ball that got their last player out.

I'm not sporty; this was just a lucky confluence of shenanigans that made me happy, probably my new proudest sports moment.",5,110,102
"Okay. So recently, I was reading a book called ""What Everybody Is Saying."" That\'s a very interesting commentary from this ex-CIA, I think, investigator who strongly stands by using reading cues from people with body language to be able to deduce things during conversation. And I first heard about the book a long time ago, but didn\'t get around to reading it until recently. And I remember what first caught my attention was that being able to understand body language is something that is very common throughout everyday life. But as I was reading the book this time around, I felt that a lot of the, I guess, a lot of the hints and observations that he was making were very, very subjective. And so, the book, while interesting, felt more like more of a pseudoscience to me.","I decided I wanted to try this new field called biomedical engineering, which my dad had encouraged me to explore. I was in college, and I was taking classes. I had to figure out what to do for the summer, and I was walking by this lab. On the door of the lab, it said artificial organs. That sounded really cool to me because it was a mix of biomaterials and engineering, and it was very applied. I could understand why you would wanna do nerve regeneration. 

The third summer was when I finally found the right interface for me. We've invented nano sensors that you can inject, that can roam around your body looking for disease, and then emit a signal in the urine. Our long-term vision is that this could help with cancer detection in resource-poor settings. 

One of the biggest roadblocks was internal. I certainly had imposter syndrome. I was always worried I didn't belong at the table, that somehow I'd been some fluke of admission, and it was only a matter of time before people found me out. In fact, it's that uniqueness that makes you different, what makes you valuable.",5,159,224
"Okay. So, I was looking through my old pictures, and I came across some of the ones from when I spent a year in Switzerland, in between undergrad and grad school. And I look back fondly on that experience because it was the first time I really lived away from home, further than College, but also living in another country. And it was a very good, growing experience.","One of the most memorable events recently happened to me, and I can't stop thinking about it. My husband and I took our first international trip together. Not only was it our first international trip together, but it was also our first big trip without our two young children. We have done several small, weekend-long trips but never for more than two days at the most.

This time, we went to Jamaica and were gone for ten days. It was such an amazing experience. We had the opportunity to get to know each other better and become closer to each other. It has been four years since we had our oldest child. That is four years without real alone time to see who we are without being Mommy and Daddy.

We got to just spend ten days in paradise, having other people take care of us instead of us taking care of other people. We ate and drank and just had a great time together. It made so much of an impact that our relationship is even stronger now than before.

We have decided to book another trip to Jamaica for next year because we found the experience to be so important and it made such a big impact on our lives. This was surprising to me because we had to save up for quite a while to take the trip in the first place. But with it being so good for our relationship, we decided we would find a way to be able to make it happen again in just one year.",3,78,285
"Okay. So prior to moving back to Boston recently, I spent some time in Asia going to a few places including Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand. No, Indonesia, Indonesia. But what I wanted to talk about today was the visiting my extended family in Taiwan and that experience.","One of the most memorable events recently happened to me, and I can't stop thinking about it.

"Okay. So, unrelated to art, but last night I was going back to my car in the parking lot of A Whole Foods. As I was walking back, right as I was walking up to my car, the lady who was pulling in next to me rammed into it by accident. And I felt very frustrated because as I was dealing with that today because it's like relatively minor. No one was hurt fortunately, but still have to invest a lot of time and energy to go get everything resolved, including stopping by the Police Department this morning and also having to call the lady as well as my car insurance several times. So all in all, an unfortunate circumstance but tough day dealing with it.","I was driving home from the attorney's office with fresh keys in my pocket after I just signed the papers to close on my new home. The weather was beautiful, and I was on cloud nine as I drove down the interstate to celebrate with my wife and kids before soccer practice. I decided to take an express lane to get home faster and was exiting back onto the normal roadway when everything seemed fine. I checked my mirrors and looked back to my right, as I was merging from the left, and saw plenty of space to merge.

As I was almost completely merged, I felt a soft (extremely soft) bump, and then a second or so passed, and I heard the blast of my horn. It was such a slight impact that it took me a moment to realize that I actually was just in an accident. I looked back in the mirror and waved to the driver that I was going to get over to the right-hand shoulder and pull over.

As I eventually pulled over, the driver of the car got out and started yelling, and then the passenger of the car got out and was even more mad. I got out to assess my car and theirs, and I saw that they were already calling the police. I thought to myself that this was no big deal as my car barely had a scratch on it, and theirs only had minor damage.

As we waited for the police, I began to process things and realized that I am probably going to be ticketed, even though they were the ones that initiated contact with me and hit me in the back, but because I was the one merging, I was going to be at fault. I thought more and more about it, and I reassured myself that I had plenty of room.

As things progressed, I was ticketed, and I talked to the other driver, and she talked about how she worked at a body shop and could fix the car at little cost. She said that they were alright and were okay, and then they left.

Later on, I found out that they were trying to get a large settlement from my insurance company and hired a lawyer and were claiming injury. It hit me at that point that I think they were trying to pull an insurance scam. They knew that I would be at fault for merging, and they could get money out of the situation.

Now when I think of that day, I can only think of the accident and how I was taken advantage of, and I don't really feel happy about closing on my new house.",5,140,501
"So, the story that I want to share is related to, also related to the wedding, but just being in San Diego. And so, while I was there, I had a few extra days to visit and sightsee and see some of the old places from school.\n\nAnd so, one of the fun activities was, now some of my friends are still in the area working or finishing up grad school. And then, another one of my friends just started as a professor at UCSD, and so it was really fun catching up with all these people.\n\nAnd, it makes me appreciate the openness and willingness of people to take time out of their busy schedules to maintain these relationships and how much that means to me.","My aunt called me a few weeks ago and wanted me to go with her on a road trip. It was kind of unexpected, but I haven't seen her much in the last few years, so I was excited. We were headed to a wedding about 6 hours away. I didn't really know the guy getting married, but I had met his mom a few times. 

On the way to the wedding, we stopped to visit several relatives. Again, people I hadn't seen in years. It was so fun to catch up with all my cousins! We had a blast at the wedding, or rather, the wedding reception and dance! Now that was a good time. Everyone was out on the dance floor, and most of them were very good dancers. My aunt and I didn't participate in that, but it sure was fun watching everybody out there. The food was good too! 

After the dance, we headed back to another friend's house to spend the night. I had met him a few times before, and we spent a couple of enjoyable days with him. We spent a few more days visiting with more friends and relatives before we headed back. 

I absolutely had a blast. We talked all the way there and back, which was about a 12-hour round trip. This is my favorite aunt of all time, and I'm so glad she asked me to go with her. She is over 70 now and doesn't get around as well as she used to, so I soaked in every moment of our time together. 

I only wish it could've lasted longer, but unfortunately, I had to get back to work. I hope we get the opportunity to do another road trip together!",3,138,338
"So this past weekend, Alicia and I went up to the near the White Mountains area, so Lakes Sunipe, I think it's called. And the reason we went up was to go see the leaves changing colors. And as we drove further and further North, the leaves became more and more colorful. It was a really pleasant experience taking a road trip.","I was on a vacation with my brother, and we decided to take a long road trip through New England and up to the Canadian border. We set off with only a rough destination in mind and intending to go or do whatever caught our eye over the long drive of about a week. We stopped in many cool little towns along the way. There were really great old antique shops all over, and I loved looking through the old memorabilia.

Along the route, we were passing through Vermont, and off the side of the road, we saw a beautiful grassy mountain with a waterfall cascading down the side. We thought it looked so cool, we parked and decided to hike up the mountainside a bit. It was an easy climb but long and tiring. We stayed as close to the waterfall as we could as we went up.

We ended up climbing all the way to the top and got an amazing view. On the way back down, we took a different route and not far from the top, found a glistening pool where the waterfall cascaded and then continued out the other side. It was perfect for taking a refreshing dip, and we did! It was ice-cold but really awesome.

The rest of the trip was great. We went into little towns and ate amazing seafood. I never ate so much lobster and so many bowls of chowder in my life! It was really amazing, and there were many memorable spots. We even crossed the border into Canada and drove a ways up the coast, which was really rugged and beautiful. We visited a national park in Canada and spent one night there.

We saw many beautiful spots, but that one dip on the mountainside in the ice-cold spring water was the coolest part and a great memory.",3,71,341
"My cat, Katie, has disappeared. I live at home in Ohio. I'm just here in Massachusetts temporarily, and my parents have been taking care of my two cats, Sammy and Katie. And about three days ago, Katie disappeared, and we can't find her anywhere. None of the neighbors know where she is. We've not seen any sign of her. I've been monitoring the camera, and I'm very afraid that something happened to her. They haven't been able to find her at the side of the road. It doesn't seem like she's been hit by a car, but I'm worried that a coyote might have gotten her. And I'm really worried about her. She's my sweet girl. I don't want anything bad to have happened to her.","I moved out to the country in Oklahoma about a year ago. It is sometimes hard for me to see the animals that are killed on the side of the road or in the road. It is painful to drive past them. But on this day, I got an opportunity to help.

There was a tiny dog being chased by a large dog on the side of the road, and I pulled over and chased the big dog away and scooped up the little dog. I remember the little dog shaking so hard and just being terrified. I held her close to me and felt her breathing finally slow just a bit and her shaking stop just a little bit. She would definitely have been attacked if I had not scooped her up.

I took her home with me, and then the next day, I took her to the vet. She was not chipped, but I reached out on Facebook. And finally, the owner contacted me. I was able to reunite her with her owners.

It turns out that the people who were watching her thought that she had come in and locked up and left. But she was still outside. It was a joyous feeling to see her so happy, reunited with her owners. Everyone was crying; it was a great experience.",5,158,247
"I thought that I was going to marry the man that I had been dating. We were together for about two weeks shy of five years. And I thought he was my forever partner. But he wasn't very supportive of me coming to Harvard, even though it was only supposed to be for a year. He wasn't happy for me. And me being here was really hard on him. And I don't think that I was as attentive a partner as I should have been in retrospect. And it ultimately led to us breaking up right after I graduated. At the same time, I got some really tough medical news. And so it's just been a lot to grapple with.","I'm recently out of a relationship. As in, we broke up about a month ago. As I've been coming to terms with that and trying to move on, I've caught myself starting to have stronger feelings towards one of my best friends, and I wish they would just go away.

He's a great dude, honestly. I feel like in the off chance that we did end up together, that it'd be a perfectly fine relationship. It's not him that makes me hate that I've developed these feelings.

I hate that I'm feeling these things before I'm even fully over the last relationship. I hate that my past relationships that were not great took nearly half a year before I was ready to move on, but with the one that was the best experience I've ever had in the dating scene, I've developed new feelings only a month out of the gate.

I hate that I'm either going to sit here and wait until it's too late to reveal my feelings, or I'm gonna man up and tell him how I feel only to put an awkward bar in a really good friendship and mess that up for me, if not for both of us.

I don't know how to feel, honestly.",2,136,247
"Yesterday was my daughter Melinda's birthday, and she was 37 years old. It's hard to imagine that she's 37 years old now, 37 in one day. So, I was thinking a lot about the day she was born. I had hoped to have a vaginal delivery, and I had a room all picked out where you could stay in the same room in the hospital for both labor, delivery, and then after delivery. But it turned out that I didn't go into labor, just my water broke, and it was two weeks early, so I needed a C-section. So, I had a second C-section.","I found out that my wife is pregnant with our first child! When I first found out, I was overcome with emotions. At first, I was so happy and excited because we had been trying for so long to get pregnant. Then I was overcome with sadness. You see, my dad passed away a couple years ago. In my eulogy, I spoke about how the day that I find out I would be a father would be one of the toughest days for me. That would be because I wouldn't be able to call him and see his excitement. I wouldn't be able to call him for advice. 

My wife is now about 6 months pregnant. Still, to this day, I have highs and lows because of these two things. Highs because I am so excited to be a dad. Lows because I don't have my dad here to help me. 

We found out we are having a girl! I always thought I wanted a boy first, but when I found out we were having a girl, I was so ecstatic. I immediately went into papa bear mode. I began looking into how to be the best dad to a girl. What I needed to know about having a girl. I know that she is going to be the most important thing in my life. 

So this sums up not only my most recent important life experience but probably the most important one ever!",5,124,274
"When I was a little girl, when I was a little girl for Easter, we would go to my grandmother's house, grandmother and grandfather's house. They lived only a couple of miles from us, but they weren't really very child-oriented. And the one time they didn't invite us over was at Easter. Flash. We would go over more than that, but that was a time when also my cousins would come. My father was a twin. And so, his twin had a daughter just my age and a son just my brother's age. And then my father's older brother was only, I think, 13 months older than him. So they had had, my grandmother had three little boys, very close together. They lived in a house that they had built, pretty much built themselves. My father helped build it. It was on the top of a Hill in Andersonville, Tennessee, in front of a river and behind the road that went through town. Whenever we drove by it, my father would honk twice so that they would know that one of their sons had passed by the house. When I went to see my grandmother, we would be allowed to use the bathroom in the basement, which was actually just a commode out in the middle of the room, and there was a huge big coal pile, which we weren't supposed to play in. So when we did play in it, which of course we did, we always tried to be careful. However, the coal dust always gave us away and it was a fun time. I especially liked it when I got to see my cousins because since I lived out in the country, I wasn't around children too much except for my own siblings.","A few months ago, we took a vacation back to my home with my son. It was scary because it was my son's 1st time flying, and I was pretty stressed out about it. It was the 1st time I had been back home in years, and the 1st time for most of my family to meet my son, who was one and a half at the time.

The flight went better than expected, and we eventually landed, rented a car, got through customs, and drove to visit family. We spent a lot of time with my mother, who had recently moved into an apartment and was living on her own for the 1st time in her life. My father passed away 3 years ago, and previously she had been living with my younger sister. But she decided everyone needed their own space and moved out.

We got to see all my cousins and aunts and uncles, and my son got to meet his cousins for the 1st time. My husband also got to meet many of my family members he had never met before too.

We had time to see my best friend in the world, who I do not get to see enough. We visited my old childhood home to see how it looked, drove past my high school and grade school, and toured around all the places that had meaning to me growing up.

My mother was so happy to spend time with her grandson. Of course, she spoiled him with toys and presents. To be able to share this with my son and my husband was pretty amazing.

We live so far from where I am from; it was really great to be back with them.",5,343,322
"My husband and I got married when we were both very young. We were halfway through college. We had met right before we started college. He had a football scholarship, and I thought that money was dumb. So I really wasn't very interested in him. But we had a mutual friend who introduced us, and he thought I was going to be a snob. He thought, after he met me, that I had a boyfriend already because there was another guy from Rice who was at the same church camp that we went to. \nBut we quickly connected when we got to college and were engaged two years later, or got married two years later, halfway through school. If either one of my daughters had wanted to get married at that young age, I was not quite 20, and he was just past 20, I would have been horrified. But I think we grew together. Our wedding was a small wedding in Littlefield, which was the town where I lived. My mother wanted to do the reception at our house, so we did the reception at our house. And we had lots of friends that came for the wedding, so we got to see friends and show them my hometown. I remember being upset that I wanted to go swimming with everybody the day of the wedding, and my mother wouldn't let me because she said I would mess up my hair, which it was true. I would have, and I might have gotten sunburned. So she was probably right. \nThe night of our wedding, we drove to New Mexico. We were both poor, halfway through college, so poor college students. We had borrowed my brother's tent, which was a pup tent with no floor and not quite long as Fred so his feet stuck out, and we had to just put sleeping bags down on the ground. \nPretty soon after we got to Houston, back to school, we took our wedding money, which, if I'm not mistaken, was something like $60, and bought a $45 tent, which we used over and over again, and a $15 ice cream maker. We really thought we were flush to buy those things.","My wedding day was at the beginning of the year, and though it wasn't all that I expected, it was still a nice day and one that I will always remember. We got married in the courthouse that my husband worked on while he was roofing. My grandparents were the only ones able to come. They waited in the lobby with our youngest son, who was just 2 months at the time, while we took our 5-year-old upstairs with us for the ceremony.

It was short and simple. I wish that more family could have come to share the day with us, but it was special and will be something to beat when we get our vows renewed in the future. When I was younger, I did imagine me to at least have a nice white dress and a bridesmaid in a church. The fact that it wasn't in a church did bother me a little, and I wore a regular but nice red dress I got on sale for $40.

I would have loved to have flowers because my husband always brings me red roses. Being that it was in between our birthdays will be nice for an anniversary. I am thankful that my kids were there. I am thankful that my grandparents were present. I am thankful to be able to legally marry my husband. And I am thankful that it was a nice day.

In the future, I will be thankful.",5,426,270
"So, when I was a little girl, I was born in Memphis, Tennessee. But then my father, who was a dentist, went to a special public health program in Atlanta. But then we moved back to the family home, town of Andersonville, Tennessee. And while our house was being built, we lived in the house in front that was probably 150 years old when we were living there. My great aunt lived in it. It was a two-story house. We had the top story. And I remember having a baby bed and watching the lights of the cars on the highway in front of the house coming by. It wasn't a very busy road, so it wouldn't happen very often, but I would see them come and move all the way across the room from one side to another. That's my earliest memory, those lights. When the house is finished, we moved into our own house, but I still loved to go up to the upper story, and I kept some toys up there at my great aunt's house. The families, our families, would put apples from the apple trees down on newspapers in one of the bedrooms. And one of my jobs was to go up and look for bad spots and turn over all the apples and look for bad spots and throw away blends with bad spots. Actually, if they had a lot of good on them, I would bring them downstairs and my grand aunt would make applesauce out of them or apple pies. I liked playing in the other room, and eventually, we had a bed in there when my parents got a new bed, bedroom set for our house. They put their old bedroom set in one of the bedrooms upstairs. And in the summertime, I liked to go up there and sleep. I had to share a bedroom with my little sister, and a way for me to have a room of my own was to leave our family house and go to the house next door. My aunt also liked it because she didn't like to be alone. And I remember that every summer I would look forward to moving out of our house and moving all of our stuff up to the house. I'm not sure my mother liked it very much, but she didn't mind since I was company for my great aunt. I found out only later, and it was so strange that I never noticed it while I was semi-living there, that there was one room that was never finished out. You can see the window from downstairs, and it had a curtain on it, window shades. But there was no door going into it, so the house didn't fit the door. And that was kind of a mystery. That makes a good Halloween story, I think, since nobody ever knew what was in that room. Fred, after we were married, tried to get a ladder and look through the window, but the curtains were pulled so they couldn't really see very much. So we still don't know what was in it. One of my friends bought the house after we moved from Tennessee, and they completely redid it. So I avoided asking when we went back what was in the top.","Monday, my daughter started ""Big Girl School""! She has officially entered Kindergarten! Being in school isn't new to her though. She has been in Pre-K for a year, so she is used to getting up, putting on a uniform, and even being around the big kids. She was very excited to start Kindergarten.

I, however, am not ready for her to be so ready. She went to bed early at 7 PM and the lights went off! I woke her up to our traditional ""Wake Up Song"". I've been singing her this song since she was a baby. This stirs up the emotions, knowing she is now a ""big kid"". Sometimes she sings along, sometimes she pulls the covers over her head.

I also got up early to cook breakfast. Our daily breakfast consists of egg whites, turkey bacon, and fruit. Every once in a while, I will let her eat her favorite cereal, but we keep it healthy! She only ate a little bit. I reckon she was nervous.

So we grabbed her sparkly book bag, lunchbox that looks like a purse, and her huge shopping bag of school supplies and headed to school. I am very blessed that her school is only 5 minutes from our home. We got there in no time, and I walked her inside.

The teachers had the kids sectioned off in the cafeteria by grade. I went to give her a kiss before she sat down, and she covered her face!!! Later she told me that other kids would make fun of her. BUT IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN!!!

Looks like my baby girl is already grown!!!",5,629,330
"This isn't really a story about one of my travels, but I was thinking I would like to talk about collections today when I was a little girl. We lived in Tennessee. My father had been a botany major at the University of Tennessee before he went to dental school. And in the fifth grade, we had to make all kinds of collections. We had to make a mineral collection. And my father helped me with that. He went to a friend of his who was a geologist and got a bunch of samples of things. It wasn't really much work on my part because the geologist just gave me the bunch of samples, and I put them in a box and turned it in, but I got a really good grade on it because there were a lot of them.\n\nAnd then the next thing we had to make a collection of was leaves. And I decided that one I was really going to do by myself with help, but not like I had done the minerals. So we were required to have 20 leaves, and I ended up having over 100 leaves. One of the most memorable was going to the University of Tennessee campus, where there was a ginkgo tree; echos didn't grow anywhere else in our area of Tennessee. And we got the leaves from that. As you can imagine, in East Tennessee, there were many, many kinds of trees, so it wasn't hard at all to come up with 100. And I also got a good grade on that.\n\nFunnily enough, when we moved to Texas and I got to high school and was in high school biology, they also required collections. And I'd saved my mineral collection and my leaf collection because one, because it was pretty, and the other because I'd worked so hard on it. So what I did as a sophomore in high school was just basically take out the exact same things I'd used and put them in a new presentation format and turn them in. And I also got A's on both collections. That time, we also had to make an insect collection. And I had fun doing that because I like insects. And I collected maybe 50 or 60. My method of collecting insects was to capture them in a jar and stick them in the freezer until they were frozen. And I thought that killed them. Well, it turns out that freezing does not kill all insects because in the middle of the night, I had used the desk in my little brother's room to put my final Styrofoam board with the pins through the insects. And in the middle of the night, he started yelling, and we get running in there. And many of the insects had revived and were hopping around the room. The grasshoppers came loose with their pins. They were hopping around. The wasps were flying around. So I learned the hard way that freezing is not a good way to kill bugs.","I decided to go into medicine -- my parents would approve. So I took a job first as an orderly. Then I had a bad car accident, and I reconsidered what were the most important things in what order.

I ran into a professor who was teaching baroque art. He said, ""Have you ever heard of this profession, conservation? They seem to combine art and science."" I said, ""Oh, I better look into that.""

I'm glad the more I reflect back at what I've done that I made the choice that I did because you don't get the seconds back. You don't get the minutes back. You don't get the days back that have gone by.",5,567,140
"So, when our girls were in high school, we took a trip to Costa Rica. And the girls, I think they were both in high school. Although Melinda may have been in junior high school, and Susanna, a freshman in high school. I think that is what it was. So I planned the trip, and I planned it all online. There wasn't any Expedia back then, I don't think, and a whole lot of things that would make it easier now. We didn't have then, but I used a travel agency out of Chicago, strangely enough because they had some good trips in Costa Rica. So we flew into Costa Rica, and then went to Arenal, and then we went over to the Pacific Coast and stayed in a beautiful Airbnb zone. Arenal was so rainy and humid that everything in our suitcases was drenched. You could even wring them out after the end of the time, even though they hadn't been out in the rain. And when we got to the Pacific Coast, we had an Airbnb. We had a separate room for the girls, and for us, they overlooked the ocean. It had a beautiful swimming pool, and both girls were just as grumpy as could be about the whole thing because they missed their friends. Since then, they often talked about how wonderful the trip is and how they're ashamed of themselves from being teenagers. But I tell them I was worse when I was a teenager.","I just got back from a vacation, and as is often said, I need a vacation from my vacation now! My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen-month-old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience. We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car.

I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation, and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2, I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well.

We engaged in a variety of activities, including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit and just enjoying the beautiful scenery.

Although it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget. It was wonderful to have time to spend with them and also with my brother and his family. They are very dear to us.",4,288,327
"Okay, so we are now on the third generation sent us. And my nephew Sam had dated several girls that we really didn\'t think too much of. Those seem to be like they just wanted him to buy them stuff. But lately, we met a few years ago, we met a woman that we really like. She was from Puerto Rico, and she was a switch therapist. And sure enough, she and Sam kept dating. And then the next thing we heard, they were moving in together and buying a house together. And now they had the most adorable little girl named Liliana. And a few minutes ago or about a couple of hours ago, I got a phone call from Sam. And he said, ""Do you mind if we stopped by? We need to have a place to change a diaper."" So they came by and Elia walked all around and took nuts and gave them to everybody in the house. She calls my husband TIO Upuelo, and she calls me TIA Apuela. And we think that this is a great couple. Unfortunately, they\'re not going to have a destination wedding in Puerto Rico, but they might have a party there.","My wife and I met in primary school. When we went to high school, we started dating. After 2 years of experience and lots of problems, we broke up.

2 years we have stayed away from each other. Then, after a good time thinking about our life, our plans, and dreams, we started dating again.

Now everything was different. Now I know that I've found the woman for me. The woman I want to spend all my life with!",4,231,94
"Today, I want to tell about my experience as a medical student. When I went to medical school, I went back after being a nontraditional major of cultural anthropology. Then I applied to medical school and went to Texas Tech, which was in Lubbock. It was a fairly new medical school, and they didn\'t have the hospital built yet. So, for the third year, they shipped the entire class to El Paso, which was definitely high Spanish speaking, and it was there that I actually learned to speak Spanish because my patients also spoke Spanish. Even though I took it in class, I hadn\'t really used it. I\'ve been in the Peace Corps, and that really helped me with knowing how to learn a foreign language with joy, which is to go ahead and use it.\n\nIn my obstetrics rotation, we got to deliver a lot of babies. There were many women who came across the border from Mexico to have a baby because then the baby was an American citizen. So back then, that was a lot easier than it is now. We could walk across the bridge and have lunch and come back to do our afternoon\'s work. We went back and forth really easily. \n\nBut one night, the medical students were a couple of medical students were doing, working in, delivering, and we had had a very busy day with a lot of deliveries. Each one of us had gotten to deliver more than one baby. And a woman came in, and it was my friend Philip\'s turn to do the delivery. And so, he was taking off initial assessments. We played this game where we tried to guess the weight of the baby just by the physical exam. And we were pretty widespread in our guesses, but we were more accurate by just making a guess without even going and looking at the mom than we were in trying to assess, which told us a lot about that. \n\nSo this particular night, it was late at night, and the residents had opted off the bed, hoping to get some sleep when a woman came in. And she was having what we call a precipitous delivery, which means her labor had progressed so fast that she was delivered right on the stretcher in the labor room. So my friend Philip delivered the baby. He barely had time to get off gloves. He actually caught the first baby while putting on his gloves. Got the gloves up, and we were all teasing him, and his friend was teasing him about delivering babies without gloves when all of a sudden, the woman started to cry again, which amused us. She\'s about to deliver, and we thought, ""Oh, it\'s a Philip."" Went over, and what do you know? It was not one. It was a second baby. So she had twins. Fortunately, at that time, he still had his gloves on, so he caught the second baby. And we still had all of this happen so fast. We had sent somebody to go wake up the resident because we weren\'t supposed to do deliveries without a resident around. But we\'d already done good at that point in the night, two twins. And so the resident hadn\'t even come back yet because we had to get him up when the second baby was delivered.\n\nAnd so, we got the second baby out, cleaned it up, and we were all laughing and teasing about Philip delivering twins. He actually, at that point, wanted to go into obstetrics. So he ended up going into anesthesiology. And suddenly, the nurse came in with the labs from the woman that we had taken initially. We had said, ""This has some night, right? We all got to deliver babies, and Philip got delivered twins. What else could happen?"" Just at that moment, it was like they\'d been planned. And the nurse walked in and said, ""I have the labs at gs, syphilis."" The mom had syphilis, and the two babies had to be evaluated for syphilis. I think they turned out to both be okay. But we\'ve teased Philip forever about we were going to tell his girlfriend that he had gotten exposed to syphilis while he was in El Paso, away from her.","My daughter and I took a trip to California. She read online about the train going down to California. It was highly romanticized but it did look nice. We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery. It surprised me that the food was so good.

However, one of the really surprising things was the people we met. When they seat you at dinner, they put you with strangers, so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story. The stories were so interesting, and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them. In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once. It was really amazing. One person was nearly 94, but he appeared to be in his seventies. One couple was from the Philippines. One man was laid off and took a low-end job, and he admitted that his parents were supporting him.

There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and I kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story. Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story. We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures, and it became very raw and personal.

Previous to this trip, my daughter and I had not been very close. This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close. But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me. What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband. It was so surprising because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy.

Yet through the stories of strangers, I feel closer and more focused than ever. When she was little, we were so close. However, as she became a teenager, we have a more strained relationship. But after this trip, we are as close as ever.",5,825,399
"Related to the Indian restaurant, I guess I'll tell a story about my first experience with Mexican food. We live in Tennessee, where nobody ever had Mexican food. The foreign food that we had, which was Zena is very excited. Was pizza and also sometimes chow, Megan. But my aunt is from Texas and she went to Texas to visit and came back with some canned corn tortillas and some canned, I think, enchilada sauce. So, she invited us over. Up until that time, I was probably nine or ten, maybe ten. I really didn't like any kind of food. I liked hamburger and French fries and Pinto beans and pretty much that was it. But she made us Tex-Mex food, enchiladas, and tacos, and it was so delicious. I instantly converted to being a Mexican food lover. And also, that was the muller when I started eating other things besides my very limited diet.","I went to a holiday celebration with a backdoor cookout. It was memorable in the sense that it was the first planned outing with my children, who are still toddlers. It's been difficult as a homemaker with my toddlers, especially during the first couple of years. I feel like I sacrificed a lot to personally raise them, and sometimes I still feel ambivalent about my decision to have a family. So, to say this was personally memorable, at least to me, might be a bit of an understatement.

The part about the holiday party that stood out the most was just sitting in their backyard and drinking a beer straight from the bottle with the sun shining on my face. I was tasked with watching one of my toddlers while my spouse took care of the others. It felt easier with one kid. I think the work multiplies significantly with more children, and I can understand why most parents these days want to stick to one child.

Anyway, that moment in the backyard felt relaxing, like something I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was equal parts freedom, and for a moment, it felt like I didn't have any kids at all. I mean, I had one that I was watching at that time, but that fleeting moment felt like a tasty raindrop when you're stranded in a barren hot desert wasteland.

My children thoroughly enjoyed the event, despite not really eating the great food. They got to play around with other children who were also there, and they got to see what an actual party with adults seems like. I personally enjoyed it and wish for more events like that in the future.",5,182,319
"So, I've been working on my outdoor deck. It's in a home that my partner and I got about three years ago. And we are not super handy, but we've been trying to figure out how to make some of the repairs ourselves. And it so happened that the deck outside needs a new set of paint in the outer layer. And that's something we have been working on. It's interesting because we're getting to learn how to do the research online to understand the different materials, different adhesives, different companies that are out there, how to let it dry for the right amount of time, how to strip the existing paint, etc., etc.","Recently, I was looking to purchase a home. While doing so, I listed my house for sale by owner. While a house I wanted to purchase did not work out, my home was still for sale online and someone decided to see it. 

A few days later, a lady came over to look at the house with her realtor. She spent about an hour there checking it out. About an hour after leaving, her realtor called, and they put a cash offer on my house that I could not refuse. 

Because she was a cash buyer, the sale of the house was scheduled within 3 weeks of signing the agreement. I went from casually looking for a house to 3 weeks out from the sale. I had to quickly find a rental while I look for my new house. It took me almost 10 days to find a place that I wanted to sign a lease for, but I did end up finding one. 

Between getting the keys and signing the papers, I had a total of 6 days to move my entire home. The home inspection went well, then it was down to the closing. The closing went smoothly, and I walked out no longer being a homeowner. 

Definitely a really random and stressful situation that worked great in my favor. All in all, it was a great success.",3,134,257
"Badminton. When I was in 11th and 12th grade, and I guess I clung to it like, what's the phrase? Like a fish takes to water. I started playing 6 hours a day, every day, and I became really good at it within a matter of a few months and started playing competitively. Eventually and so on. And then, because I had to go for my undergrad, I had to drop badminton and just focus on my curriculum and academics. It's only after a hiatus of, I would say, 14 years that I have picked up badminton again. And I've been playing very actively over the last three months, and it's been a lot of fun. Yeah.","I'm 23 and just kind of finding my own path. I wrestled when I was 11 years old. It was because my dad got me into it. I went out and got my butt kicked by every other middle school kid I went up against, 35 times in a row. 

Before I was really capable of making decisions for myself, my parents had rooted in me that I needed to find a way to persevere in the things that mattered the most. Whether it was figuring out how to feed myself or clothe myself, just day-to-day activities. 

Athletically, they wouldn't let me quit in the middle of the season. It went a long way. They taught me not to give up so easily. 

My biggest complaint with the American system and graduating high school, going to college, and getting a job is that the common progression is to prepare you to be an employee. But you don't have to. There are ways and avenues to be able to go around and make something happen and build a business around something that you love.",4,139,204
"When I was back in undergrad, I was in my first year living in a dormitory for the first time. My roommate did not show up on the first day that I started living in the dorms, nor the second day. But suddenly, when I came back from shopping on the third day, he was standing there in the room. And as I walked in, we looked at each other, we sized each other up. And he was like, you know what, this will do. And what I mean by that is, when you meet someone, I think there's energy, there's a vibe they give out. And it was very interesting to see my roommate, and the moment I saw him, to know that I was like, this guy and I are going to get along very well. And we did. We made it through the next six years throughout undergrad in Glasgow. And to me, that is remarkable.","I started talking to a guy that I've always noticed and got along outstandingly with, and I realized that I might have been stifling feelings for him this entire time because I really just haven't been in the best situation recently.

But we really started talking, like really talking about our lives and future plans. This was two days ago, and then at the end of the day (we had been talking on Snapchat), he put a little thing on the bottom of his snap that said, ""I think you're cute,"" but in German, so naturally I was like, ""I think you're cute too,"" and we talked until 12 that night. I woke up to a good morning from him.

Once we both had free time that day, we just talked, and I couldn't help but fall for him a little bit more. We were talking earlier too, just about the small things: my dad passed away recently, his service is tomorrow, and the guy is going through some rough stuff in his family right now, so I just tried to make him feel better.

And then he said he thought he was in love with me. I said that I really liked him too, but I think we have issues with ourselves we really need to work out before we can pursue something like that. I adore him, though, and I really hope I didn't mess anything up.

We agreed to just be there for each other, to be friends as best we could, and just go from there in life. I don't know him very well yet, so I really respect that decision, and frankly, I'm just excited! This is the first serious thing I've had with a guy.

In any case, I'm just happy that I have someone like him in my life if we end up as friends or something else.",4,186,369
"So my friends were participating in the Kindergarten Five K last weekend, and they roped me into it. I used to be a runner back in school, but haven\'t done it in 15 or 16 years. And when they asked if I wanted to join, I said, ""Yeah, let\'s give it a try."" I would love to be able to train, but it looked like every weekend between when I registered and when the race was raining. And so, at the end of the day, we decided to just do a couch to five K, which is get into the actual race without doing any training. It felt a little intimidating, but it seemed as though it would be an interesting experience in itself, without the intent to win or get a super fascinating timing. But before the race, I did a lot of research around how to practice, what the mindset should be, how I should pace myself, etc. And consistently, and most importantly, the advice I got was, ""Know what your average pace is and go just a little bit below that."" And it turned out to be a good race overall. I got a good timing, it was enjoyable enough, and the fact my friends were celebrating made it a lot of fun overall.","We live in Canada, and sometimes the winters can get long. November is gloomy. December is usually cheerful just because of the holidays, good food, and people, and then it drags out with freezing temperatures, dark nights, and crappy driving conditions from January through April. I find I get sad around February since I'm just wishing for sunlight and for my face not to hurt when I go outside.

We finally got a huge dump of snow, and my husband and I picked up our season passes and went snowboarding for the first time. Did I fall an insane amount? Yes. Were some of my wipeouts spectacular? Absolutely. Do I know what I'm doing? Not particularly. Am I in pain? My butt is so bruised I'm looking like a plum. But man, did we have fun.

When I first brought it up in October, my husband said he wanted to go with me, and I was thrilled. He's a bit of a homebody in the winter, so I was just excited to be able to share a sport with him. We bought all of our gear without even having tried the sport and just waited for the perfect time to go.

We had so much fun, and I'm really looking forward to hitting the hills tomorrow and again later this week too! I get to spend quality time with him, we're being active, we're learning something new together, and we're spending time outdoors - it's the best of all the worlds combined.

It's making the winter seem so much shorter since I'm actually wishing for winter to stay and more snow to hit. It really helped change my attitude on winter.",2,252,328
"So when I was done at the Climate notch, I met an individual who was working for a group that I really liked. It's fascinating that they were able to invite me to join the script that looks at the transition of fossil fuels away from being used in a manner that encourages an increase in their use, I guess, to have to develop a plan for reduction that is very data driven.\n\nAnd I was fortunate enough to be invited by him to a group that is looking at it from multiple angles. I guess what I'm looking to share here is that I find that some people are very driven but they're not just driven when they are young, but driven throughout their life. Because a lot of the people in this group are in their sixties and seventies.\n\nAnd what I find fascinating is the drive they have, the passion they have, even at the age they're at, towards a cause that is important to me right now and I hope is important to me as time goes on. But to be able to do something towards the cause in your elder years, I think, is very admirable because a lot of people become very closely attached to their material accumulation and become fearful of losing what they have or having less tomorrow than what they do today. And I've always suspected that that's what makes people lean more towards the right.\n\nBut I feel that having met a group like this is going to allow me to keep on honing my tribe towards working as a problem solver and topics that are important to me.","I grew up with a mom as an artist. She was a landscape photographer, so every summer for about one month we would travel somewhere fairly remote. We started just going to different places in the United States, and when I was 10 or 11, we started leaving the country every year. That gave me this time and space for a month at least every year to soak up nature.

I traveled to Greenland in 2006 for the first time with my family, and at the time, climate change was really not a topic of discussion here in the United States, as it is today. I just didn't realize how huge of a crisis it was, and it made me realize I wanted to focus my work on those issues.

Climate change is such a distant concept for most of us because it's not happening in our everyday lives. It's like this slow train wreck and it disengages us. You get scared, and shocked, and overwhelmed, and then you don't know what to do.

A lot of studies have shown that we make decisions and we take actions based on our emotions more than anything else. You can write the word ""glacier"" and you can describe it. If you see an image of a glacier, it's an experience.

I'm trying to encourage people with positivity and hope. If you fall in love with something, you wanna protect it. You wanna do what's best for it.",2,297,283
"So, growing up in India, we had this festival called Diwali. It's pretty big for the Hindu population. And every year, I couldn't wait to get my hands on firecrackers and go out and burn them with my friends.\n\nAnd it so happened that once I got to 8th grade, my family would let me out with my friends late at night. So, we'd be out in the streets, in the parks, even at 01:00 a.m., 02:00 a.m., bursting firecrackers. And even 20 years later, now I think about that really fun from the perspective of how, first of all, the city was so safe that as a kid, I could be out with my friends deep into the hours of the night. But then also that I always had this love for fire and fireworks.\n\nNow, in the US, it's only on the 4th of July that you get to see fireworks, and I find myself not as drawn to them as I was as a kid. Also, the fact that I'm not burning them myself is just a spectacle that you're watching. But it's just something I've been thinking about lately.","On July 4th, I was at home in the morning, doing nothing and feeling kind of sad. I unexpectedly got a call from one of my friends, and she invited me out with her and her boyfriend. I was kind of surprised and pleased at the same time.

We ended up going to the movies to see Spider-Man, and it was such a funny movie. After that, we got dinner at a local Mexican restaurant nearby. I ordered tacos, and my friends order nachos to share.

We left the restaurant after finishing our meals and saw a food truck selling ice cream across the street. We decided to get ice cream cones for dessert. We walked about for a bit while we ate our ice cream and chatted about different things.

About an hour later, we found the perfect spot on the grass near a bridge with an open view of the sky. My friend made a comment that it would be the perfect spot to stay and watch the fireworks. I agreed, and we sat down and waited for the show to start.

After the fireworks show was over, we all went home. I felt so happy that my friend wanted to share that holiday with me, and it made my entire day so much better. I was very happy.",4,224,246
"All right, so I wanted to share about my childhood trauma. So I picked this topic to discuss with you because the experience we have as a child shapes who we are as an adult. Also, internally, I think we all still have, we are still children inside, although we look like we're grown up. I think the internal development happens rather slowly than the outside development. So in that case, I think it's really important to understand in order to understand myself, I wanted to go over my childhood experience and some stories that I still vividly remember.\n\nSo one of the things that I wanted to share with you is when I was like five or six years old, I went to ballet school almost every day. And I took the school bus to commute to the ballet school. And to my young eyes, the distance seemed pretty short. I think it took about ten minutes to commute from my home to the ballet school. And I went to ballet school like I said, almost every day. And I would always look out the window and look at the streets. So to me, I was pretty confident that I could find my way back home without taking the school bus. So I guess as a young child, I was pretty brave and adventurous. So, I decided to walk home without taking the school bus. \n\nSo I started my adventure. And then obviously, like ten minutes by bus, I guess it probably would take more than 35 or 40 minutes by walk. But since I was only five or six, it would have taken more than an hour or so. Obviously, starting at a certain point, I realized that I got lost because all the streets looked unfamiliar and I guess the road started to become much wider. I guess so. I guess I was starting to enter almost like a highway. Because I remember the cars were running really fast and there were so many cars. And the sidewalk was pretty narrow, even to kids like me. So I realized that I got screwed, and I didn't know what to do. So I started to cry. I was hoping that someone would come and help me out but it seemed like the cars were running pretty fast on the road and nobody was reaching out to help me. \n\nSo I don't know how long it took, but I cried and cried and I was just keep walking straight and then suddenly a car pulled off and I still remember this scene but the window went down and a guy asked me, Are you okay? Are you lost? And I was even scared of the person. But in the back of the seat, there was heat. It was about the same age as I was so I think looking at him made me feel much more comfortable speaking with him. So I said, Oh, yeah? I got lost. And I was still crying so hard and I couldn't stop crying because I was so scared. So thankfully, he took me into his car. And he took me to the police station. And from then on, the police took me home because I remembered the apartment names and all that kind of thing. So, thankfully, I went back home safely.\n\nBut I wanted to share this story because it kind of reflected my personality, which I think I still have, and sort of a pattern that I have in my life. So I guess I'm pretty brave and I'm not afraid of trying something new. However, I could underestimate stuff easily. And then, if I face a problem (I mean, I'm talking about me as a young kid), if I face a problem, I would not actively try to solve the problem like asking people for help, but I would just wait until people reach out to me and help me out. So as a young kid, I think that kind of worked because people, thankfully, helped me out and I found my way back home. But a lot of things, these kinds of patterns happened until I was in my early twenties and mid-twenties, I wouldn't actively try to find solutions. But I realized at a certain point that being scared and panicking doesn't help, and I should be more actively proactive in finding a solution on my own. So yeah, I guess I think that's the difference from me as an adult and me as a young kid.","On Thanksgiving Day - that's the only day my parents would take me out to dinner - there was this woman going through a garbage can, with her little daughter, about three or four years old picking out her Thanksgiving dinner out of a garbage can. At that point in my life, I began to think, it's not as good on this planet as I think it might be. 

One of the things I wanted to do when I grew up was to try to make the world a better place. But I didn't have an awful lot of confidence getting there. Because as a Puerto Rican kid in New York going to some terrible schools, nobody ever told me as a kid that I could really amount to much at all. 

But finally, I met someone who helped me, and I was able to make the leap. And then when I got into college and met some professors that had some faith in me and encouraged me to go to graduate school and so on and so forth, I always pointed my life in that direction.",4,858,205
"All right, so I wanted to talk about my pack. The experience that I had with my pets. I think pets are a very important part of my adolescence and my childhood. Now, I don\'t have pets anymore. I mean, I\'m now more of a plant person. But when I was young, I had birds, hamsters, and dogs. So, I really loved animals as a young kid and young adolescent and especially today. I want to talk about my first pet, which was a dog. I think the first experience is very meaningful because you are doing it for the first time, so it\'s very special. And also, it\'s more likely that you\'ll make a lot of mistakes, so it\'s likely that you will remember it longer due to, maybe, you may have some regrets. You could do it better if you think back or something like that. So anyways, I think first experience is very important. So, I\'ll share a story about how I had my first talk. So when I was nine years old, about nine years old, it was a summer day, one summer day, and it was late in the evening. I don\'t know why, but I was heading out to do something and it was very rainy. The rain was pouring. It was raining heavily at the moment. And so I took my umbrella and I headed out from home. I lived in an apartment at the time and I was in the lobby. I mean, the elevator opened and as soon as the elevator opened, I saw a wet dog, a little dog. It was soaked in the rain. And it was small, but it looked poor. It was shaking because of the cold and was so wet, and it didn\'t move. It didn\'t move and it just kept making eye contact with me. So I was immediately like, ""Oh my gosh, I have to run back and bring a dry towel or something."" So I took the elevator back to my home again and I was thinking, ""Oh my gosh, I hope the dog doesn\'t go away."" So I went back home and I brought a dry towel. Thankfully, the dog was still there. It was still shaky, but it looked so meek. So I slowly approached it and I wrapped the dog with a dry towel. It didn\'t move or resist or bark or anything. I pet the dog and I looked into its eyes. It was so cute and so poor. So I wanted to bring the dog back home. But I knew that at the time, my mom didn\'t like dogs because she never had a dog before. And I asked her several times before that moment, but she said no, we cannot have dogs. So I was worried. But I brought the dog back home anyway because I didn\'t have any other choice. I don\'t remember her reaction at the time, but we decided to keep the dog. And then I was in elementary school, first and second year. I started to build a bond with my first dog. I would bring.\n\nIn front of the school, they sell junk foods like candies or jellies or whatnot. I now am knowledgeable about how bad it is, how bad junk foods are for dogs. But at the time, I didn\'t have that kind of knowledge. So I would just buy all kinds of junk foods like candies, jellies, snacks. And then I would bring them back home and I\'ll feed the dog. But there was a very joyful moment. And I would go out with the dog and I was very happy to have the dog. It was like the dog was my very good friend. So I think, I don\'t know how many months later, but the dog started to grow. And also, my mom was sick at the time, so she mostly spent her time in bed. And the dog started to make some kind of mess. The dog, I guess, was in the adolescent phase, so it started to mess around the house. It would pee here and there and it would chew the furniture. So my mom was starting to get annoyed. And then one day, when I returned from school with junk foods, I realized the dog was missing. So I asked my mom and she told me that she sent the dog to one of our relatives who had a dog and lived in a house, not an apartment, and where there was a big yard. So she sent the dog to their family. So I was like, she didn\'t even ask me before she sent it off. So I was crying all day long. Obviously, I was so angry and so sad. But since she said she told me that we can always go visit the dog because the dog was at our relative\'s house. And then I think, like, a week later, she told me that the dog ran away from their family and now the dog is missing. So my last hope was gone. I was hoping that I would go visit their family and reunite with the dog. But now the dog had run away from that house. And it kind of stuck. And I always kind of thought that the dog will find a way back to me. I would always imagine or expect that thought. I was so smart that he might be able to find a way. So before I go to bed, I would pray like, ""Oh my gosh, please let the dog find a way to my apartment."" But that never happened. And as a young kid, I would always think, ""What happened to my first dog?""","My daughter and I took a trip to California. She read online about the train going down to California. It was highly romanticized, but it did look nice. We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery. It surprised me that the food was so good.

However, one of the really surprising things was the people we met. When they seat you at dinner, they put you with strangers, so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story. The stories were so interesting, and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them. In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once. It was really amazing. One person was nearly 94, but he appeared to be in his seventies. One couple was from the Philippines. One man was laid off and took a low-end job, and he admitted that his parents were supporting him.

There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and I kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story. Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story. We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures, and it became very raw and personal.

Previous to this trip, my daughter and I had not been very close. This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close. But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me. What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband. It was so surprising because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy.

Yet through the stories of strangers, I feel closer and more focused than ever. When she was little, we were so close. However, as she became a teenager, we had a more strained relationship. But after this trip, we are as close as ever.",5,1113,400
"So today, I wanted to share a story about one of my friends from childhood. Her name was Tajong, and ""Tajang"" means kindness and sweetness in Korean. And just like her name indicates, she was a very nice and kind person.\n\nMy friend, when I was like eight or nine years old, and we were the same age, but she was much more mature than all the other kids who were the same age. She was almost like an older sister to me. I didn\'t have any younger or older sisters, so I felt like she was like my older sister. She was also taller, much taller than me. So I felt like she was very nice and mature and kind to me, so I guess I would act more like a baby when I\'m with her.\n\nAnyways, whenever we met to play together, she gave me a small gift, like a scented eraser. At the time, I didn\'t appreciate her gift that much because she would give me very small gifts every time we met, and I almost took it for granted. And I didn\'t give her anything. I don\'t know why, but I took her gift and also showed me a lot of kindness and friendship towards me. Whatever I asked her to do, she would say yes. And she would adjust her schedule to mine, and she would come to my neighborhood to play with me. So we had this kind of relationship where, almost always, starting with almost always, whatever I would ask her to do.\n\nAnyway, every time she would come to play at my apartment or my neighborhood, we played something fun. And one day, I called her to play at my apartment, but she didn\'t show up, so I got really mad. And later I figured out she was going to move to another city. And she gave me a handwritten letter as a parting gift. And at the time, I was still mad because she didn\'t show up when I asked her to play with me. So I was a little salty. But after she left for another city and I couldn\'t see her anymore, I kind of realized how much I relied on her. I felt so empty and lonely because she was gone.\n\nAnd one day, I opened my desk drawer, and the drawer was full of the scented erasers that she gave me as gifts. And I didn\'t use any of them, so they still smelled very good. And at the time, as soon as I saw all the erasers in one place, I kind of realized at the time how nice and good a friend she was to me. So I regretted a lot that I lost her and I could not meet her anymore. And I also regretted that I didn\'t give her any gifts.\n\nI could never forget her name, even after several years. I always missed her, but at the time, we didn\'t have any means to contact each other because we only had our home phones. Well, I guess I was too young to ask her house phone number or whatever.\n\nAnyways, I lost her contact, but she\'s always in my mind, just like her name Tajong suggests. She was a very kind and sweet person. And I will always remember her as someone who was very mature even at a young age and who showed a big heart and friendship towards me.","My heart was broken. I don't know how to process this. I just received news today that E had passed. I am just so sad and numb. I can't believe she is gone. I am relieved for her but glad that she no longer has to be strong and brave. She can finally find peace. Selfishly, I wish she were still here.

I can't help but reflect on the last year of emails and all the thoughts and memories that we shared. We learned we were more alike than I think each of us ever expected. We found joy and humor in the same things: a good comedy, a book, and always in pursuit of those foods that reminded us of childhood.

I am flooded with memories and thoughts of her. She was creative and so smart. She was daring and bold. Fierce.

My mind always goes back to when we were kids at our first swimming lesson. We were tasked with jumping in the water that was well over our heads. She was the first to go as I sat on the edge with her sister, scared and nervous. When it was Edie's turn, she bravely jumped in without hesitation. She immediately popped out of the water, with a big smile across her face. This gave me the courage to follow her lead.

And throughout our childhood, as we came of age and tried new experiences, she was like an older sister to me, even if it was only by nine months.

These are the thoughts that make me miss her and feel nostalgic for a different time. I will always think of her fondly and miss her for all my days. I will find inspiration and remember how knowing her made me a better person.",4,644,336
"Oh. So today, I wanted to share a story about my grandmother on my father\'s side. Growing up, I wasn\'t very close with my grandmother because she kind of looked cold. She was a reserved personality and she was very quiet. She didn\'t talk much and we didn\'t talk much. So I guess, I was kind of scared of her growing up. And she also lived in another city, so I didn\'t get to see her that often. And I\'m not sure if it\'s the same for everyone, but for me personally, I felt much closer to my grandparents on my mother\'s side than to my grandparents on my father\'s side. And one of the reasons it felt more difficult communicating with my grandma was because my grandfather on my father\'s side had a stroke earlier in his life. He\'s half paralyzed, so he could not talk. So it was kind of very awkward being in my grandparents\' place where my grandma and grandpa don\'t talk that much to each other either. So I guess I didn\'t feel comfortable growing up. However, our relationship started to develop and my father asked them to move near our house so that my parents could take care of them. So when I was in my first year of middle school, they moved to our neighborhood. My dad kind of forced me to visit my grandparents\' place either with my mom or with my dad. So almost every weekend, I visited them. And I could definitely feel that my grandma was pleased to see me, especially because she would always sit next to me, and she would smile at me, looking at my face. At the time, we also didn\'t talk much. We would mainly just stay there and watch television together, but I could definitely feel that hospitality of hers. So anyways, our relationship changed dramatically when I moved to Canada to study abroad in my second year of middle school. So at the time, I was in this foreign country on my own, so I was really lonely and I missed home. So I called home very often, and almost every day, I called home. And one day, my dad told me to call my grandma. So I wanted to talk to everybody at the time because I missed home, so I called my grandma without expecting too much because I know she\'s quiet and she doesn\'t talk much. But as soon as she heard my voice, she started to cry. And I don\'t know why, but I also started to cry because I felt that at that moment, I think I realized how much she adored me. So after that moment, after our exchange of emotions, I kind of realized that she adored me so much and she missed me a lot. So after a year, I returned back to South Korea, and then I visited her place more often than I did before. As I entered high school, I visited her during the lunch break because her place was right next to my high school. So I guess we became much closer. However, I decided to study abroad in the US for college. So during the college years, I didn\'t get to see her that much, only once or twice a year when I visited South Korea during winter or summer break. And it was one summer she got cancer, and she fell very ill. And I don\'t know, all of this developed so fast, and she was in a hospice. Oh, she was in the hospice, not hospital. She was in the hospice. And my parents told me, ""You don\'t have much time with her, so you should visit her more often."" But I was kind of scared of visiting the hospice and seeing her because I had never experienced the death of someone who\'s close to me. So I was kind of scared of visiting, so I didn\'t end up visiting her a lot. But it was one day that I was in her hospice, and I was sitting next to her bed, and she just looked at me and she smiled. She smiled like she used to when I visited her house. And then the next day, she passed away. So I guess I cried a lot during the funeral because I regretted a lot for not visiting her as often as I should have. And I knew that she adored me, and she adored me the most out of all her grandchildren. I guess I was special to her, and she was also a special person to me. So after she died, I kind of thought about death and relationships and those kinds of things. And I also reflected on her life a lot. And I started to realize that she must have been really lonely because her husband, my grandfather, could not talk for a very long time and he couldn\'t walk like just any other people. He always needed help from my grandma. And I guess my grandmother, it wasn\'t easy for my grandfather to live a life, but I also could imagine it wouldn\'t have been any easier for my grandmother either. So thinking about their lives and my grandma\'s life, I kind of feel a little bit heavy about life. But yeah, but one day she appeared in my dream. And in my dream, I didn\'t know that she had passed away. But I don\'t know why, but I was so delighted to see her. I ran to her and I hugged her. And she looked really nice in my dream. She dressed up very nicely. She was wearing very colorful and beautiful clothes. She didn\'t use to wear those kinds of clothes when she was alive. But in my dream, she wore a very colorful and beautiful dress. So I was like, ""Oh, grandma, you look so nice."" And so I felt very delighted and happy to see her. So when I woke up, I realized, alright, she passed away. I realized that she passed away. But I kind of felt relieved to see her in my dream. And she looked very well and happy and healthy. So I guess in my dream, I just wanted to, I guess through my dream, I wanted to comfort myself and relieve that guilt that I felt towards her. And I guess I wanted to wish her well and happiness wherever she is. So that\'s my story.","Today, my family gathered in a small town. It has been years since we have all been in the same place at the same time. Usually, seeing long-lost relatives is a joyous occasion for most families. We aren't most families. Usually, we don't all get along.

Today wasn't usual. Today, we gathered to pay our respect to one of the most complicated men most of us have ever known. Today, we all supported each other and consoled one another in the name of my Dad.

My dad passed away a week ago, and today was his memorial. This has been a difficult week. Trying to grasp the fact that he is gone has been tough, but today was the worst. We had an open casket. He looked so strange; it was him and yet not him.

I watched as some of my family broke down into tears, some quietly. Others held it in. I felt I had to be strong for my own little family. My children will never again get to see their grandpa. I will never again get to see my dad. Yet as a dad, I couldn't let my kids watch me break down completely.

After today, all that will be left of him is his belongings and his ashes.",5,1233,248
"So, since we are talking about moving to a new place, I wanted to share my story about my history of my relocation and how my perspective in life has changed since then. So, I've been living in different countries since I was young. I lived in Canada, India, and now I live in the US. I was originally born and raised in South Korea, so I guess so far I've lived in four different countries. I also traveled to many different countries like Japan, Europe, and Southeast Asia as well. So, I guess I enjoyed a nomadic lifestyle—not nomadic like Nomad lifestyle because I am a person with a lot of curiosity and I like exploring something new. And the excitement, for excitement of exploring new places, like overweight the desire to settle down and feel more stable, I guess. However, I realized recently that my perspective is being changed. Part of it is because I think I've already moved three times already this year from different apartments. So, I'm really tired of packing and unpacking and cleaning the old places and new places. I'm kind of tired of doing all that. But more importantly, I think I'm more focused on my career development and my expertise nowadays. So, I guess the excitement coming from my career and pursuing my dream is more important now than to travel and exploring new cities and meeting new people. So, I finally feel like I found a career and a job that I can—I feel like I can dedicate my life to it. I'm pretty satisfied with where I am, and in order to do a better job at what I'm doing, I guess I want my environment to be more stable than just jumping from place to place. And also, what else? Also, like my taste, have been developing, and now I have a lot of books, a collection of magazines. So, I like photography, so I have a lot of camera equipment. And I have like drawing tablets that are pretty big, and I use my own computer for video editing and stuff. So, I have a lot of stuff that I use for my job and for my hobby, and that reflects my taste. So, it's been quite annoying to bring all those things around. So, that's also part of the reason that I wanted to settle down. Also, I wanted to, like recently I've been thinking that I really want to buy a house, and not buy a house, but I want to buy land and I want to build my own house and decorate it and design it to reflect my taste, to reflect my personality and my interests and stuff. So, yeah, I'm aiming to do that in the next couple of years. So, I'm going to work hard and try to achieve that dream. But, I haven't still figured out where I want to settle down, I guess. That's not a problem. That's going to be number one homework that I need to make a decision before I actually purchase a house. That's how my perspective and lifestyle has evolved from a nomadic lifestyle to somewhere who takes more stability in settlement.","I recently moved back to a big city to look for a job after a few years. After graduating grad school in this particular city, I had moved upstate. However, last month I packed my suitcase and came back to the same city to look for a job. I came back for a few reasons, one being better career opportunities but also to connect with my friends.

I stayed over at a friend's apartment for a few weeks while trying to land job interviews. There I rediscovered our friendship from years ago. We both went to college together, and it was heartwarming that despite years of not really communicating other than Facebook messaging, we got along pretty well. It was almost a comforting sign. It was like the universe showing me positive signs that I might be on the right path.

For a few years, I was unsure of where I should be. However, coming back to the city and meeting with old friends showed me how much I felt at home here. Right now, I am working a temporary job to hold me over. However, I really pray that I will find something stable here and am able to live and work here again.

Although the city has changed, I still love it. Finally, I realized this is where I want to be.",4,624,251
"Okay. So, I would like to share my story about losing weight and gaining weight. So, growing up, I wasn\'t sad. I was normal- normal weight in the normal average weight range. Maybe a little bit on the skinny, not skinny, a little bit on the less than average weight size because I really liked exercise- learning. I learned ballet, I learned like martial arts and dance and all kinds of that. So, I did move a lot, so I wasn\'t really fat. But one day, when I was 15, I suddenly gained a lot of weight. And I\'m going to talk about why in a moment. \n\nSo, the reason why I wanted to discuss with you the history of my losing and gaining weight is because I know that a lot of young women and men have issues and they really just work out hard or sometimes they just restrict their diet so drastically. So, it affects their health and all kinds of that. I think nowadays, physical beauty kind of became central to one\'s identity and I also can empathize. I also have those kind of issues. So, I thought it would be interesting to talk about that as it reflects the current trends and issues that most young people are experiencing. \n\nSo, I\'ll go back to my own story. So, when I was 15, I studied abroad in Canada and it was my first time ever to live on my own without having family around. So, everything was really new, and I couldn\'t speak English or understand English very well. So, I had a lot of trouble adjusting to the new environment. So, I developed a lot of anxiety and I guess I was a little bit paranoid at the time. And the only thing that gave me comfort was food. So, whenever I was scared or whenever I felt insecure, I guess I started eating to make me feel better. \n\nSo, I lived in a dormitory and on the first floor of my dormitory, there was a kitchen which stored fruits and cereals 24 hours so I could always go to that kitchen and have bananas, apples, and cereals whenever I wanted. And especially, late at night, I felt more insecure than worried about the next day and stuff. So, after midnight, I would go down to the kitchen and I started eating a lot of bananas, a lot of cereals until like 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. And then, without noticing, three months later, I gained like 20 pounds. \n\nSo, I didn\'t realize the change in my look, but people around me, they told me that, ""Oh, you gained some weight."" So, I kind of had noticed that I might have gained some weight, but I didn\'t really care that much about weight gain. So, like about a year later, after two semesters, I decided to return back to South Korea because obviously, I couldn\'t adapt to the new place. And so, I returned to my old school and then my friends didn\'t even recognize me because I gained so much weight and I looked totally different. \n\nSo, after returning back from South Korea, I slowly lost weight. But I think I brought the psychological issues with me, which was when I felt anxious or stressed, I would go search for food. So, there was a link between the stress and the food that was built in my mentality. So, I lost a little bit of weight but I never returned to the normal weight as I was before studying abroad. So, when I\'m under a lot of stress, I would gain weight and when I\'m feeling fine and when I\'m having a good time, I wouldn\'t eat too much. So, this fluctuation of weight started since then and then until I think it did continue until recently. \n\nBut as I got older and I reflected more on my life, I recently started to watch a lot of inspirational videos and workout videos. So, starting from this year, I started to work out more often, and I started to go to the gym a lot. And I started to learn Thai chi and boxing. So, I started to learn martial arts again and I think they really helped me to, I think they helped me to find the issues that I had, which is like a better control of myself and my stress. So instead of going for food, I could manage the stress better. I guess more like a cake later, I started to break this linkage between the food and my anxiety and all that. So, I guess that\'s a huge jump for me. So, I\'m continuing to do that, I\'m planning on continuing to develop this healthy habit. And yeah, I would just like to have better control of myself and my stress.","I hate being female in this society. I hate body standards. I hate society for making me grow up comparing my body to everyone around me, seeing only one body type to look up to in media. I hate that body types go in and out of trend. I hate that skinny is an accessory.

I hate that I grew up with family monitoring my body in a way they didn't do for my brother. I hate how impressed everyone was when I lost my appetite for a year. I hate how much better I got treated once I lost weight. I hate that I wasn't even given the chance to accept my body before it started giving out.

I hate that it's easier to tell people about my medical history than it would be to tell them I gained 10 pounds. I hate how much it's all shaped me. I hate that no matter how hard I try, I can't reverse the harm.",5,935,183
"So today, I'd like to share how my perspective on happiness changed throughout my life. Since I was really young, I feel like I kinda knew how difficult life would be. A lot of responsibilities and pain would be involved. After I grow up or as I grow up, since I was a little kid, I really wanted to avoid that kind of pain and pursue only happiness in my life. That is, for me at the time, happiness meant status without pain, and only joy and pleasure exist. So I hated, as a teenager or as a college university student, I hated taking the past or doing stuff that I didn't want to do, like studying a subject that I'm not interested in. And I only wanted to study subjects that I am interested in or do something that I really enjoy. And I think this mindset wasn't helping me to grow because I always try to avoid painful situations or painful experiences. It hindered my growth. Now I look back, I understand that. But anyway, since I was young, I was interested in Buddhism because Buddhism seemed like it talked about breaking out of painful life and going to the status of endless peace and happiness. So when I was in my mid-20s, early 20s, I did practice some Buddhism. Some practices I practiced were meditations and practices done in Buddhism oftentimes. But I don't know when, starting from when, but my perspective towards happiness slowly started to change as I was exposed to military content and army content. There was some popularity towards the ex-Navy SEAL-like ex-army officers that arose in the last couple of years in the US and in South Korea as well. And I've been watching their content and motivational content from the ex-Navy SEALs or ex-army officers or whatever. And it fully changed my perspective towards pain and happiness. They all talked about it. It was interesting to me because I was trying to avoid pain, but they were willingly accepting the pain or even welcoming the pain. And they go through painful situations on their own and willingly. So watching how different they are from me was interesting and I started to learn from their lessons and learn from their stories. And now my interest also slowly shifted to, like, MMA players, you know, mixed martial artists and the UFC, because they're all fighters and they go through a lot of hard training and painful training. It inspired me a lot. I think this kind of exposure to totally different people inspired me and made me think about happiness in totally different perspectives. And I also realized slowly that my level of happiness never changes. I have, for example, this year I achieved some of my goals that I said earlier in the year, but the joy only lasts for, like, 30 minutes or so, and then I'm going back to the same level of happiness that I was before. And also, when my environment changed this year, it was really difficult for me. But after a couple of days, I got used to the new environment and new situation. I thought I would be miserable forever, but I was okay. Actually, after a couple of days, and I restored a level of happiness that I contained before. So this made me realize that actually, happiness is I cannot gain happiness by avoiding pain, but happiness is kind of always there with me. And no matter what happens in my life, I'll be okay. And actually, painful experiences help me to realize that I'll always be okay and I always have the same kind of happiness level. So I don't really need to avoid pain or pursue happiness. So yeah, I think that's how my perspective towards happiness evolved over the last couple of years.","Dealing with racist issues in Texas, in the South, in the 80s really impacted my academic self-esteem. Once I got past that, I had a teacher who encouraged me, who basically did a very simple thing. He told me that you define you. If you define yourself, it's got to be up to you. That completely changed my life at the age of ten.

When you go through a period of your life where you don't believe in yourself very much, and then the light comes on and all of a sudden you believe that, ""Wow, I can do anything I set my mind to. If only I knew what I wanted to set my mind to.""

I have a big issue with prioritizing because there's a lot that I want to do right now. And so when you try to do everything, that's when you get frustrated.",5,731,172
"So, I've been thinking lately about myself. I have many hobbies and interests, and I enjoy doing them all. And mostly, they are not a group activity but more individual activities focused on individual activities. And I love doing them because it makes me feel like I'm learning something and I'm expanding my horizon. However, I also feel like I'm not really good at group activities or doing something together with other people. I think I need to work on it. \n\nSo, for example, yesterday, my husband and I were actually planning on going hiking in New Hampshire with his lab mate. However, yesterday I decided that I could not go because I had some projects that I wanted to work on. These are personal projects and projects related to work. So, I told him that I could not go and he should go with his friends. And of course, he was disappointed and pretty mad because of the change of plan. So, we had a little bit of an argument. And then, he left for hiking this morning. But, it makes me feel bad about it. \n\nSo, I was reflecting on myself. Maybe am I being too selfish by putting my personal project or my work-related project before family or people? So, I think I've been like this since I was young. I think I always had many interests and I was always involved in different activities. And those were usually focused on the project itself rather than the relationship with people. So, I think this is who I am, part of who I am. But it arises as some kind of problem or center of conflict when I'm in a relationship or when I'm with family, with people who I care about. I don't know how to solve this problem. And I think this will always be an issue. And I hope that my husband or my other family or friends could understand about this. But I also understand that it might be a little selfish desire for other people to understand that I'm putting my work and my project behind them. That's why I'm feeling a little bit. Not depressed, but feeling a little bit of self-reflection time here.","I feel alone. It is so frustrating. I used to be fine with it, but then for some reason I actually started wanting to have a friend. I have nobody. And nobody around me seems interesting enough to me. Life gets boring. And frustrating.

I am a frustrated person. I want to feel romantic love but I only feel it for my ex, and it is the slightest amount so I cling onto it. I don't know if I'm aromantic or something. It is so frustrating having to chase that feeling. My ex was the only one ever to give me a slight feeling of romance. I do not get crushes. I would never kiss someone, touch makes me cringe.

But I want the picture perfect life. Nothing will make me stop wanting a wife and family. And my ex is the only one I could possibly have it with.

I am so lonely and I know it is just messing with my head. Nobody understands me. People think I'm weird and crazy. Everyone does. Nobody is here for me. Nobody knows who I really am. And I feel like I can't relate with anybody all of the time. People frustrate me so much yet I need them to fill some void in me.

I worry. I distract myself with school, but each day I come home and it's the same. The feeling of dread. I hate myself. I hate everything.

I've been less timid. Trying to be more approachable looking. It doesn't work. I put myself in situations to talk to people. We don't get past surface level stuff.

I am trapped in this isolation. It gets me so mad. I am trying. I physically can't speak at times and I have to use hand gestures a lot. I can't speak! What else am I supposed to do?! My voice is wrong when I do manage to speak. It is not expressive or funny. People think I have no emotion and I am so serious.

I just want to be normal. I am not normal. Something is wrong with me but I don't know what.

I just want a real friend. I just want my ex back. I hate my life, I hate myself.",3,429,442
"So, I have a friend who recently lost his father due to a tragic car accident. And I heard this news on a day of going for dinner. I felt really bad for my friend, and I was so heartbroken because I know how kind and sweet of a person my friend is. So, I could see that although I haven't seen his father, I could see that he must have grown in a very happy family. And he talked about his father a couple of times, so I know that he loves his family and his father, of course. So, I know how difficult it would be for him. It was very difficult for me also, thinking about it. I felt so powerless. I feel like nothing could comfort him in this situation. So, I felt really bad that I could not do much for him. It also got me to think about my own family as well. How would I feel if my dad suddenly passed away? I couldn't even imagine that. And I have a really good relationship with my dad, and I talk with him about everything. So, losing someone that important, that close, and who supports you, who made you actually, in this, would be unimaginable. I've experienced that with my grandparents, but I think it's very different from losing your parents. So, yeah, it got me thinking about relationships and death in life, in general. So, I think it's inevitable. I will die someday also. And I will see my parents die someday. So, I should always take the moments in time preciously because it's not going to last forever. This tragic happened to my friend just got me thinking a lot about those kinds of philosophical questions. Sometimes, just thinking about that makes me feel so humble and makes me feel like everything is less important than I am actually thinking it is. But yeah, I don't know how to... I guess I'm trying to think on a brighter side. It can also broaden my perspective somehow and embrace the difficult moments in life as more grateful. But I was very heartbroken to hear my friend's youth. And yeah, I just thought I wanted to share this story to hear what you think about.","A good friend of mine recently died in a car accident. Attending his funeral was very emotional. I was in tears the whole time I was in the room with his body. It was so incredibly unfair to me that this funny, kind, gentle human being was dead at only age 37. He had only just gotten married two years ago. That's all the time he had with his wife: 4 years of dating, 2 years of marriage, and then dead, with no kids to pass on his legacy, all because of a distracted driver.

It made me so incredibly sad and also furious at how unfair life is. At the funeral, we were encouraged to get up and say a few words. Some of his family did get up, but so did a few people that only seemed to be doing it to draw attention to themselves, like, ""I know he is dead, but have you thought about how *I* feel about it?"" which only made me more mad.

Although I hate speaking in front of people, I did go up to talk about what he meant to me. I did not mention how I felt about the other hangers-on who got up to talk because that would have been very inappropriate for a funeral, but instead tried to draw the focus back to what a wonderful human being this man was. How I never saw him angry, how I never saw him complain, how he always was so fun and jovial and approached each day like a blessing.

Later on, his wife told me how happy she was about my little speech. I felt glad I could support her. It also made me think about how when I die, I want a happy, positive, and small funeral.",4,443,340
"Okay. So this isn't really anything exciting? It's not an exciting story. But it's something that I learned recently about myself. So I thought it'd be interesting to share. Wait, let me take a look at my note. So, I think when I was young, younger, I really wanted to achieve something in life really fast. And I wanted to be recognized as a successful person. So I had this very big desire. But I'm so naturally I searched for a field or area where I thought I have a competitive advantage. And one of the fields or professions that I found that I could do better than other people was in the creative writing field. So I got a lot of compliments from teachers and family and friends about my writing skills or my imaginations. So when I was like early twenties, I wanted to become a famous novelist or successful TV scriptwriter or a filmmaker. So I did internships, and I worked as a writer at a radio station, like a production company and youth agency. But I didn't last long in those fields because I was so impatient. I wanted to be really this famous writer. But what I was at the time was like a low-paying freelance writer and I could not bear that difficulties, and could not. I didn't have like, it wasn't like because fortunately, I had the support of my family. Even though I was low pay. I didn't have to worry too much about financial issues, but I was just very disgruntled about how, the stage I was in, I guess. So I felt like I'm like the lowest person in this organization. And nobody really listens to me, and I couldn't stand that struggle. So I called it quits, and I jumped to the other area or field and industry. And I think when I look back, I think I was very immature and impatient at the time. If I was a little bit wiser, I would have seen those struggles and difficulty of learning opportunities, or opportunities to grow. But I just really wanted to be at the finish line rather than going through this step by step. So now, today I'm in a completely different field and not doing anything related to writing. Although I believe writing is very essential in all kinds of work and industry. Now I think I'm a little bit, I've learned my lesson from the past experience. However, today I felt like I was like the younger self. I was feeling a little bit agitated about who I am right now. And I was comparing myself to whom I want to be in the future. And I would not be very satisfied about myself, but since I had older now, and I'm more experienced. Not immediately, but I kind of try to remind myself the outcome that I had. If I have that kind of mentality. So I guess I'm trying to self-talk, trying to reinforce myself more in a more positive way. And rather than jump to the end result. I'm trying to enjoy this moment. I know it sounds very cliché, but I'm really trying to be grateful about my surroundings and who I am right now. I think it's good for my mind. And I think it's more, it gives me more motivation and energy to continue to work on my future goals.","We are creating soft, multi-layered forms that interact with environments and create a space in cities that open up our imagination and allow us to think about a different way of being.

So I had $300, and for graduation, I got a plane ticket to Bali. And I went off on my own and started walking through the rice fields until I found a little house to rent. I went as a painter, I shipped all my paints and they got lost, and that is how I became a sculptor because I had no paint. 

I was in a fishing village, they had fishing twine, and began just experimenting, and from there I had this dream of bringing it back home. I applied to seven art schools, and I was rejected by all seven. And that turned out to be the luckiest thing ever in my life because it forced me to have to learn how to teach myself. 

The education to do what I do, there is no program. If I had gone to a program, it might have led me somewhere, but it wouldn't have been as authentic a direction. Any kind of life where you're trying to do something new and creative, you're gonna hit rejections all the time. 

My mom had a saying for that too, it's like just toughen up, let it come at me. Just because you're rejecting me from every single art school I've applied to, that doesn't mean you get to say that I'm not an artist. 

The thing I had to teach myself after college was how to hear my own voice, like, honestly, I just didn't even know it to recognize it. Making decisions is gonna happen to you your whole life, they are always hard, you've got to figure out how to make them. And you have to listen to yourself and get to know yourself.",5,660,366
"So today, I want to share a story about my history as a driver. I have a reputation for being a bad driver, especially among my family and friends, because I have some stories of me making some bad decisions as a driver. So first of all, when I first bought my car when I was, like, 21, I think 21, I bought a car and I took the car and was driving back home with it. While I was trying to turn left, there was a huge truck right next to me with a long trailer. And of course, as a new driver, I wasn't very good at gauging the distance, so I hit the truck's trailer with the right side of my bumper. So I ruined my first car. I think it was after ten minutes, it was more than, like, 50 minutes after I started to drive. So that's the first story. And obviously, I was very heartbroken, but thankfully, I didn't get hurt and the truck driver didn't get hurt. He was super nice and said it's okay and nothing is too damaged, just my car, so he let me go. So yeah, that was the story of me on my first car. The second story is that while I was driving with four friends in my car, I ran into a reversed way, so I saw another car coming right at us very far, and my friend sitting next to me started to scream, like, started to scream, and she got really scared. Thankfully, I saw another way out on the side, so I immediately, like, as soon as I saw the car coming right at me, I turned my wheel and then entered a different lane. So unfortunately, well, I didn't kill anybody and nobody got hurt, but it kind of was a really scary moment. And then when I was in San Francisco, I was in the Bay Bridge, there was a lot of traffic jammed, a lot of congestion in the Bay Bridge, and I was driving, I thought I was just casually driving, but then suddenly, when the car in front of my car stopped because of the traffic jam, the driver right in front of my car came out, and she started to scream at me. I didn't understand what she was saying because I was inside my car, but then I kind of realized that she was saying I was tailgating her, I was driving too close to her car, so she got really mad. Yeah, and there are a lot more stories of me hitting a wall while I was driving, I was trying to park. These stories kind of shaped me as a bad driver. But now, and also my husband, he doesn't like me driving because he thinks I'm reckless. But in my perspective, I think my husband is driving like he's driving too safely. He always tries to never, ever go beyond the speed limit. And I think that's just too strict. I think it's okay, I mean, you have to abide by the rules, but he's just always abiding by the rules. And for example, at a stop sign, I stop at the stop sign, but he scolds me because I don't stop for, like, 5 seconds or something. And he thinks that we have to keep that five-second rule or something. So, like driving, I was very stressed because of the driving. When I drive and my husband's next to me, we always fight. So, I kind of stopped driving and I let him drive. It's been a while since I haven't driven for a long time, but recently, I started to. Recently, I have this urge to drive, and I feel like I want to drive because I just want to feel more independent and I just want to have a lifestyle and that kind of lifestyle that I want to pursue kind of needs driving. So, I want to, like, for example, I want to go hiking on the weekends to a different state somewhere far, and I also want to go to the beach whenever I want to go and I want to listen to music in my car and have my own time or something in solitude. And I also sometimes want to drive motorcycles. For me, I think it's important to get back to driving and also, I don't want to hurt anybody or put anybody in danger like I did in the past. So, I want to also be a good driver as well. So, it's my goal to start driving again and also to be a confident, good driver.","I am heading home from work when I was hit from behind in my car by somebody not paying attention. This was always a possibility, with driving for work each day, but I always thought my defensive driving strategies and confidence in my abilities would be able to avoid it. But, sometimes, other factors play a role in my life experiences. The damage to my car was heartbreaking to see because I knew what was to come.

The accident caused my car to be totaled, along with my confidence on the road. The driver was not helpful; he did not care and lied to my face and to the police officer. This made me angry and lowered my trust even further in people, which is already very low.

The funds I had been saving would now need to be used for a car, which was not part of any plan. All the time and effort spent on saving seems to have been for nothing, and once again I feel like a failure due to this financial situation.

Then, my luck seemed to change, the car was quoted by an insurance agent and I received a lot more money than I thought for the car. I was happy again, but that withered away as I began searching for a replacement car. I was forced to take on more bills and even more worry.

On the plus side, I finally have a decent car that is nice and dependable, but my confidence and anxiety are in a rough place. I am now even more worried about driving, and damages to my new car that I have to pay a lot of money for many years.

The confidence I had in my driving has still not come back, and this makes me feel like I lack ability and weak-minded. I hope this passes because I do not like feeling worse about my life. I will have to work on getting my confidence back and reducing the amount of daily worry I have.

This was not a great day or experience and has definitely impacted my life each day since August 5th, but I think it will pass soon and I can have my mind and confidence back.",5,918,409
"When I was a little kid, I used to play chess all the time. I used to be really good at it too. At one point, I was ranked 20th in the country, and I used to go to tournaments all the time. I used to go to places like Las Vegas, San Diego, and I used to spend all my weekends just at tournaments. It was pretty fun, and it was nice for my parents to drive me all that way so that I could compete in chess tournaments.","I always wanted to be on an Olympic team. My aunt lived next to a bicycle store, and they had a Sunday morning bicycle ride, and I went on the Sunday morning bike ride. The owner of the store said, ""I can make you an Olympic cycling team."" So I stopped playing football, I stopped running track, and I rode a bike.

It was pretty simple. From my family, I had great support. It was different in school. I always felt I was challenged because I wanted to race a bike or be a professional athlete. There was no preparation for that.

Part of the challenge of youth is to learn. It's the puzzle. That's what makes life interesting. If you have all the answers, then it'd be very boring.",4,101,155
"But yeah, one time I went kayaking in Seattle with my girlfriend. And we were in a tandem kayak. So we were both on the same kayak, both trying to pedal. And as a joke, I started pedaling backwards, and she was confused as to why she wasn't moving forward.","A couple of months ago in May, I took my 6-year-old son fishing for the first time in his life. We woke up very early in the morning, eating breakfast and brushing our teeth. After doing this, we loaded up the car with our fishing gear and prepared to get out on the road. We drove for almost an hour until we arrived safely at our destination.

We ended up going to the Clearwater Pier in Clearwater, FL. Clearwater pier is a huge bridge which used to connect Clearwater to St. Pete but was shut down and later repurposed into a fishing pier.

The morning started out by me teaching him a few safety precautions and showing him how to tie his lines and properly set up his fishing poles. We then began to proceed to fish, the morning started out slow, but eventually, we began catching fish. The first fish he managed to catch was a small Jack Crevalle. I was so proud of him in this moment; no words can describe how it felt watching my son catch his first fish and being able to help him do this.

We kept fishing until lunchtime, catching a few fish in between. At lunch, we prepared a picnic with the food supplies we had brought. Once we finished eating lunch, we began fishing again, catching multiple more fish each until we decided we had fished long enough.

We packed up our gear, which took around 20-30 minutes, and got in the car. After getting in the car, we decided to stop on the way home for hamburgers and ice cream. Once we arrived home, we cleaned our fishing equipment properly and went inside to shower and relax.",5,59,319
"It. Yeah? So last? When I was seven years old, I moved back to India from the United States.","When I was a little kid, I wanted to be an astronaut, I wanted to be a scientist. When I got out of high school, my parents wanted me to go work at the pen factory in town assembling pens. My mom took me to all the little factories in the county to turn in applications because that's what I was supposed to do. 

My mom did graduate from high school and then got married. And they sort of expected me to do the same thing. Go work in a factory, go get married, have kids. 

There's still a little bit of a rift in the family because I went off and did my own thing. So it doesn't always turn out perfect, but I can live with it. I love my family, they love me, they're just not happy that I live 2,000 miles away. And they just really don't tell their friends I build video games.",5,24,181
"So last winter, I went skiing in Big Bear, California. And I\'ve been skiing before, but this particular time, the snow was really wet. It wasn\'t soft. There wasn\'t a lot of snow that year, and so I had a hard time braking. So, I fell down a lot. It sounds painful, but it was actually kind of funny because I went on the steeper slopes, and my friends were like, ""you should just do it."" And then I did it. And then I started to fall. But in the end, it was pretty fun, even though I felt weak. We went and got some ramen after, some Fu afterwards. And the warmth of the Fu really helped warm me up after falling in the snow all day.","I found rock climbing my freshman year of college. I wanted to stay fit, I want to stay healthy. It was something to distract me from the stresses of school. I got to relax and be focused on myself. I fell in love with it.

It's a physical ability, but also having the mental confidence to do these obstacles because they're terrifying if you first look at them. I felt like this is my chance to show people all around the world that women are stronger than what people make them out to be. Break beyond the grain of, ""we're quiet and timid,"" and that's who I am.

I do well because I think I have fun with it, and it's really just exploring new things and getting scared and feeling uncomfortable, which is one of the biggest things. Throwing yourself into a situation where you're feeling uncomfortable and working past that grows you as a person and prepares you for adult life.",4,154,187
"There used to be this pizza place in India called Pizza Corner, and they had this special dish called a Koniza, which is basically a pizza wrapped into a cone. And it was one of my favorite things to get from that restaurant. And the Konisa is not available widely anymore, mostly because they just don't sell it anymore at Pizza Corner. So I hope that they bring it back someday because that's one of the things I really enjoyed for my childhood in India.","I came from a tropical country where it's always summer. Then, I moved and lived in Japan. I can't begin to describe how much I love having the other 3 seasons to enjoy! And my favorite has got to be fall.

I came to Japan late summer, and it was fall that was the first ""new"" season that I got to know. It was magical how the days became so cool, like there was AC turned on everywhere. I can wear thicker clothes and enjoy hot dishes without sweating so much. It was just so comfy, I was so happy I can experience it.

But since we didn't have this season back home, I didn't know how to spend it. I had to watch Youtube videos, and it's mostly western people with pumpkins and pumpkins, and lots of sweets and spices. Right now, I bought tiny pumpkins to decorate various corners of the house. I plan to get some dried bouquet flowers too, and a lot of candles.

I don't bake, so I got bottles of aromatic oils that smell like pumpkin pie, caramel cookies, coffee cakes, cinnamon rolls, vanilla frosting, etc. Oh, plus movies and books! I'm going through a lot of fun adventure stories. I plan to marathon the Harry Potter movies.",5,94,255
"Yeah, so when I first started grad school, actually throughout college for undergraduate and graduate school, I didn't do a very good job of balancing my time between exercising, doing schoolwork, and making time for my friends. And I think it's an ongoing process of improving, but I think I've gotten better over the past few years because lately, I've been doing a good job of making sure I go to the gym and do exercise, and also getting my work done and being organized. And I also do make time for my friends. It's not a lot of time, but I still do make time. So I think it's a work in progress, but I've gotten way better at managing my time in the last five or six years.","It's Thanksgiving Day here in Canada where I live, and it's such a blessing for an IB student like me. I usually have a huge workload and the time I don't spend working or in school is spent on social and family commitments, as well as worthless procrastination that always affects my work quality and makes me feel horrible afterward.

But today, I have no commitments and very little homework left over from the weekend. I put aside some time for the remaining homework, my daily hour of French learning, my daily half hour of Python learning, working on my scholarship essay, and doing CAS reflections. After all that's done, I have 9 hours of unfettered free time!

9 hours to do whatever I wish, guilt-free. Obviously what I plan to do is stock up on snacks and spend the rest of my day browsing Reddit, YouTube, and Netflix and playing video games. That might sound pathetic but I'm going to finally let myself indulge after nearly two months of hard work!",4,152,196
"So, story from my childhood. There's a lot. I grew up in Ohio, and it's a funny place to grow up. I remember playing in the backyard a lot, of sports and stuff. We used to always go down to Myrtle Beach for vacation, with some of my friends from the neighborhood. I think a lot about those times and just kind of growing up in the Midwest is interesting. Part in the early 90s. It's an interesting time, interesting place to grow up mostly good, mostly good, but just what a life.","Today I spent my afternoon working in the library after classes, and walking back to my dorm, I saw geese munching on the grass and fearlessly crossing the street. I watched the sunset behind the auditorium, heard the cheers of athletes when crossing by the field, saw the sky swathed in pinks and oranges.

For a moment, I just took it all in, closed my eyes, inhaled, exhaled. I haven't felt this recently, but in that moment, I just felt this overwhelming sense of peace.

This place is rough, don't get me wrong - I'm getting absolutely rolled academically, and I don't get enough sleep - but walking back to my dorm today, I felt like I was coming home. It was a feeling of contentment, like no matter what, everything was going to be okay.

Anyways, I hope everyone has a good day.",5,111,171
"Sure. So, I was thinking while I was at the park about how when I grew up, I grew up with my father primarily, and he didn't really know how to talk to me or communicate with me, but we spent a lot of time playing. Sports, playing games, playing with toys, just kind of like playing outside. And he always took me to play, and he was always kind of physically there, not very in touch, but always kind of demanding that I play. It made it a little less fun because he was a coach and very into sports. And so, it was kind of not as fun as I think he intended, but one thing that I am grateful for is that he always did play with me. He was always there to play with me, and that's how he kind of knew how to connect with me, just playing all the time. The first things I can remember playing, like fast feet, fluffy little games on the sidewalk, things like that. So, I'm grateful that that's how we connect with me. But sometimes I wish that he would have had more of an expanded kind of toolkit in terms of how to connect and interact and kind of be there. So, I think about that, both grateful for that and it's both challenging. It's challenging to connect with him today because that's all he knew. That's all he knows is kind of like exercise and play.","Initially, I did not want to be a teacher. But as I went through school, I realized by the time I was in high school that I needed to be a teacher. The reason that I needed to be a teacher was that I loved school a lot. I loved learning a lot. But I didn't have a teacher that I really liked.

I felt, at a young age, that if I had had that kind of experience where I felt connected to my school and connected to at least one teacher, I would've been an even better student, and school would've been a better experience for me.

I felt that when it was time for me to become a teacher, my job was not to be your friend but for you to know, as strict as I was, that I still cared about you and I cared about your achievement, and I cared about you as a human being.

I've gotten to a place in my life where what is most important to me is to make a difference, no matter how small or how big, it's to make a difference.

Whatever you decide to do with do in your lives, it has to be something that becomes your life work. It has to be your life work. Because this world now is at a place where you can make money, you certainly can make money. And you can make a lot of money. But your life's work, a piece of it has to be able to help other people.",3,291,295
"Cool. So today, I was looking at photos of some friends. It was a friend's birthday today, and I was looking at photos from maybe ten years, from 2006 to probably 2014. Gosh, I don't know, ten to 2014. I guess maybe somewhere around there. Anyways, I was just thinking about how my friends and I used to go hike in college and just have fun and build forts. We were already old, but it was still fun to do that. And I was sending some photos to some other friends, and I was just thinking about a vacation that we went on in high school. That was wild and fun. And it was just interesting to see photos of us from when we were younger. And it made me think of how young we were and how young I was and how much we've all grown. And we look different and we were different. We were closer friends then, and now we're all grown up. And some of my friends are lawyers, and I work in artificial intelligence. And it was just interesting to look back on those photos today and back on photos throughout my life. But particularly on the photos of my friends. It's nice, I guess, to remember being so close to those people, even though we were all young and it was messy and we weren't responsible adults, emotionally or in any other way. But it was nice to be so close with my friends during those years past.","I grew up in a town of about 7,000 people. Not the smallest around, but definitely pretty small. Not quite the case of everyone knowing everyone, but news got around pretty fast. I remember so many nights just looking up at the stars and marveling at how many there were. In a way, I can really appreciate the story from the Bible when God tells Abraham to look up at the stars, and he tells him that his descendants will be the number of the stars. 

I can appreciate it even more now that it has been taken away from me. I now live in a city of 2 million, and the stars are just so washed out by light pollution that I think I'm lucky if half a dozen break through the pollution. 

It genuinely excited me the other day when I could see Jupiter shining bright as it reached its closest point with Earth. But then I felt a moment of melancholy. I realized just how much I miss seeing those uncountable stars. 

I miss my hometown. More than I'd ever admit to my parents, but I definitely miss it.",1,292,212
"Yeah, so I was talking with my father last night, and he was repeating himself a lot. And he mentioned about that his wife is concerned about his cognitive decline in terms of dementia. And some of my earlier memories were with my grandfather, his father, who had Alzheimer\'s, and he lived in our house. And it was pretty brutal to see him losing his mind. But I told my father that I don\'t think that it\'s related to Alzheimer\'s or Dementia. I think he literally just debate intellectually or emotionally, like most people do. He doesn\'t have conversations with people about their lives. He doesn\'t like participating in social events. He doesn\'t ask questions to learn about people. He never really wanted to do anything or participate in any ways. He doesn\'t know how to use a computer. You can\'t buy a plane ticket. He can\'t travel alone. He doesn\'t know how to manage his finances. He doesn\'t manage his finances. He doesn\'t really do anything. So in my opinion, his lack of participation and cognitive processes and general kind of life interest is really kind of a self-fulfilling process of his cognitive decline. There are plenty of people I know that are far older than him that really love learning or cooking or reading or hiking or exploring different ways to kind of nurture what they enjoy to do and kind of stay active and healthy in their lives in that way. But really, the only thing that my father likes to do is to sit on the couch, go jogging, and drink beer. And it\'s been that way for his whole life. Yeah, that\'s just been on my mind. And it\'s annoying to hear him say, like, ""Oh, jamie\'s worried about me."" But really, in my opinion, it\'s the result of his personal preferences and behaviors and limitations.","I have a very gradual retinitis pigmentosa, real gradual degeneration of the retina. So I went through all the phases of low vision and now to just about total blindness.

It started to become an issue when I was 21 and was diagnosed with this disability. And then, I was aware of what my future was going to be like, that I was gonna be going blind.

So having a disability is like playing a puzzle. If you like puzzles, boy, having a disability is great because you are always trying to figure out how to do something, how to make it work, how to find technology that works. You gotta make it work for you, and I think it's very important for everybody to say, hey, I got a disability and get to work on having a great life.

That's absolutely essential, and I see a lot of people that do not accept their disability. They're waiting for a cure or something like this and the wonderful advances in medicine. That's great, but you can't build a life around hoping for something to come and cure you. You just have to figure out ways of making things work.",1,360,229
"Yeah. So, a story that I thought of was my father texted me pictures from Google Maps of the old apartment that we used to live in. And he was like, ""I love that. That was the greatest of times. People love talking to you because you could talk like an adult. And your grandmother helped us out so much."" And I didn\'t really have great memories of that time in my life or talking to anyone. So, yeah, it was just interesting to talk about those differences. I asked him if he had a plan for us to move into a house or anything like that. And he said no, that he was just trying to kind of get by to make sure that we had everything that we needed. So, that was just an interesting conversation about my past. Yeah.","I used to live in shared homes in different countries (Dublin, Poland, South Africa) my whole life. 3 years ago, I turned back home to my country (The Netherlands), and I have lived with my parents since then. 

I've been trying to find a nice place for myself since I got back, but with the current housing crisis, this was really a challenge. But last week, I finally found a nice apartment, and I signed the contract today! I am just so happy! Finally, my own place! 

The whole apartment used to be an office building. It has been completely refurbished, and there's a fully working brand new kitchen and a fully built bathroom. I can't wait to move in!",3,162,146
"Yeah, I had like a really good learning from a friend, well, acquaintances really, at a bar. And essentially, there\'s two acquaintances, friends. One is named John Ross and the other is named Alfred. John Ross is like 39 and Alfred\'s 89. And Alfred leaned over to me and he asked me a question. And he said, ""Are you happy?"" And I said, ""Sometimes."" And he said, ""Well, that makes sense because happiness can be like that."" And he said, ""More importantly, are you content?"" And I said, ""Very recently, I\'ve become content."" And he said, ""You are with your life where your life has gone. Are you content with where you are and all that?"" And I said, ""Yes, I\'m very content, very recently."" And that was a great learning. And we talked about it for a little while, and people seem to really latch onto that. And it was an amazing kind of shared experience.","I've had multiple experiences, and all of them have been very significant in my evolution. I originally majored in geology because I liked rocks. Then they threw physics at me, and I decided that this was not for me. But I clearly didn't know what I was doing. I jumped from job to job trying to figure out. Seven months at a time, trying to figure out what I wanted to do. 

It took years later when I discovered community education, and I really felt the passion. I don't think the search ever ends. And I don't think one ever finds oneself. It's a constant journey. It's a constant search. 

I see more and more the pressure of making decisions about life. That somehow, if you don't decide where you go and how to get there, there's failure up ahead. I think that when I allowed myself the enjoyment of the journey and was not fearful that it would lead me to a dead end, it was fun.",3,210,197
"Recently, as I've become more, I guess instead of gotten to know my friends more, and the more we've been through and the more conversations we have, and the more people I've met through their lives, and yeah, just the more time I've spent with them, I've just really gained appreciation for them, and for their friendship. And that's kind of unique to feel like a true appreciation that you found some really good friends.","I'm a lucky guy. I have a solid group of friends, the core of which have been together since we were 12 years old. Life gets busy, and we don't see each other as much as we should. But a few times a year, someone will throw some kind of get-together.

For the last couple of years in early spring, I've thrown a Margarita Party. We grill carne asada, my wife makes fresh salsa and a big pot of frijoles, I make so many batches of blended margaritas. We've been friends for over 20 years at this point, and I still love these people.

The party is not this weekend, but the next, and I'm so excited I'm having a hard time sleeping each night! The night before Christmas or Disneyland doesn't compare. I'm just happy; we're gonna listen to ska, reggae, and punk. We're going to eat Mexican food and soak up the warm sun, and I'm going to laugh and hug my friends.",5,91,201
"Okay. So, today, I wanted to have a doughnut, and I went to the donut shop. And the lady there gave me two donuts for the price of one. So, that was very nice because I got two donuts.","Today I was working my evening shift, and I got an extra-large pizza delivered at my work for me and all of my co-workers to have something to eat. About 7:00 p.m., this woman came in, and she had gotten two donuts. I saw her digging through her bag for change to pay me with. She had enough change to get the two donuts. She went and sat down to eat her donuts. She looked homeless.

Something in me told me she was hungry, and I remembered there was pizza leftover in the break room. I told my coworker that I wanted to ask her if she wanted some pizza, but I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. My coworker just said ask her if she's hungry. So I went and asked her if she wanted some leftover pizza I had bought earlier for lunch. She said that she would love some pizza, so I went and got her some and warmed it up in the microwave.

I brought the pizza out to her, and she thanked me. Then I just continued working and finishing the things I needed to before my shift ended. Around 8:00, I started cleaning the grill at my workplace. I turned around to grab a rag, and the woman I gave the pizza to was standing there.

She explained to me that she hadn't eaten in a few days and thanked me again and told me that if I give her a rag, she would go clean the bathrooms for me. I wanted to just hug this woman at this point because she was willing to go clean a dirty bathroom for some food. I explained to her that it was my job to do that and that the only thing she needed to do was to take care of herself and stay safe out in the world.

This took me off guard today because this woman was hungry. I gave her food, and she was trying to do something in return when she didn't have to. I also told her that she needed to stay warm out there because it's getting cold. Before she left, she thanked me again and told me that it was kind of me to give her food and how much she appreciated it.

Strangers can make us realize how blessed we are when we can't see it ourselves.",5,47,440
"Hello. Yesterday, I found out that my partner won't be able to visit me here in the US, and that made me very sad because I was looking forward to seeing them, spending some time together, and being comforted by that. So now, I'm despondent.","Roughly three months ago, I felt it was time to discontinue a seven-year friendship. My friend Daniel and I met when I was 18, and we had a lot in common. Over the span of 7 years, a lot of intimate and fun memories were made together. We both attended college, worked, and spent many hours over the weekends hanging out.

As we both grew older over the span of our friendship, we started to drift apart. Daniel was accepted for a job across the states, and I was in the midst of nursing school. We both were finding it difficult to maintain a friendship and see each other between our busy schedules.

Both of us succumbed to our work and school and had minimal time outside to make plans to see one another. Daniel was hoping that eventually he would be returning here to the south after he completed his job training, but his approval for transfer was never accepted.

Three months ago, my life changed. I grew tired of the distance, as did Daniel. The lack of communication and vastly different work schedules began tearing our friendship apart.

Three months ago, Daniel and I made time finally to sit down in person over lunch and discuss our friendship. The discussion did not go well, and we both felt exhausted trying to maintain a long-distance friendship any further. I wanted so badly to come up with a reason to continue the friendship, but I was tired of putting energy into a practically non-existent friendship anymore.

Daniel and I agreed over our lunch that day to walk separate ways. The lunch ended with me in tears, knowing my best friend wouldn't be my best friend anymore.

Truth is, I still love him and wish him well, but I know it is time to move forward in my life.",4,55,343
"Hello. So, I was at the library, and I ran into a friend whom I hadn't seen since high school. And that was great. We went out to have some coffee. But I forgot what I had gone to the library for in the first place, which was to work on an assignment. So, I turned that in late.","I live with my parents and I'm trying to study for an exam, so I can get an A+ certification and a better job that pays me enough to live on my own. My problem is that over the past few months, I could have made some serious progress in the online IT course I'm studying, yet I'm REALLY good at procrastinating. 

I've been sitting at the halfway point for a while now and have had trouble motivating myself to continue. What bothers me the most is that I spend my day goofing off and wasting time, but not in any meaningful way. Reading and playing video games are some of my favorite hobbies, yet during my free time, I don't even really do these things anymore. 

I stare at Youtube's homepage, watch some videos I don't really care about, and if I'm lucky, I'll hop on Steam and play a couple matches of a multiplayer game. If I'm not dispassionately scrolling Youtube or social media, I'm pacing my room waiting for it to be time to head to my overnight job. 

I have HUNDREDS of games across multiple platforms that I've never finished or tried, books I've never read... a work certification that I should really be studying for. But I spend most of my free time waiting to go back to work. My job isn't very challenging and has a good amount of downtime, and I don't even use that time at work to study/read/whatever. 

I keep telling myself, ""when I have a day job and my own apartment, I'll play more games in my free time"", yet I don't do the studying that will actually get me to that point. I don't know if I'm a little depressed or just burnt out or what.",4,70,346
"Today, I had dinner with a new friend, and I really enjoyed it. I think it makes me feel a bit more at home to find friends that I really click with.","I just moved to a new town, and I absolutely love the area, but I'm at a loss on how to meet people. In the past, my friendships were based on being ""forced"" together like in the office or school.

I now work from home, and my hobbies tend to not involve any interactions with others (hiking, kayaking, binge-watching Netflix).

I also tend to be rather shy around new people, so the idea of initiating a conversation with someone randomly would make me anxious.",3,36,100
"Are you listening? Right now, I guess I'll start. I'm not sure if you're listening, I guess. The two most meaningful stories we can start out with, from the beginning. I can tell you the story of my adoption. I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and at about the age somewhere between eight to 15 months, I was abandoned on post office steps. And then, I'm assuming taken to a local orphanage. At about 21 months, the adoption was arranged for my family, which I'm very lucky to have, but I'll go back into a little more detail of my adoption.\n\nFrom what I know, I was abandoned on post office steps and then taken to an orphanage. And then, my family was tracked down. I was told that my birth father was deceased and my birth mother couldn't take care of me. After they had contacted my family, my birth uncle tried to take me and take care of me, but that also he just couldn't handle it. And so then I was finally released for the adoption process. So, at about 21 months, I came over to the United States to my current loving, loving family. I feel very fortunate and I never kind of felt empty inside about the whole adoption. I get a little emotional just talking about it because honestly, it feels very surreal. I've always had a very loving family and so there's nothing that I should be feeling bad about. I was lucky to have my parents have two biological children, John and Betsy. They're about eight and nine years older than me, so I was definitely the baby of the family, but I never grew up feeling different. In fact, sometimes I joke that I'm just a white girl, which might seem a little derogatory, but I have never felt different or undervalued in my life. Well, from this, if anything, I feel very blessed and fortunate to have landed where I did and all the immense opportunities that have been before me. I really, honestly couldn't feel luckier about the family that I had.","I heard about an opportunity in Tanzania to volunteer and work with an organization that was really trying to make an impact with people who are living with HIV. I was offered a position to run the organization that I volunteered at. A really pivotal moment for me was when I came back, I had my first daughter. At six weeks, I brought her back to Africa and was on the road, and trying to figure out how to navigate through childcare.

One of my colleagues said it was very irresponsible of me to get pregnant. And that was, to this injustice, fire in me. But I packed up my family from Africa and moved. I guess there was the question of why the US. I just figured the US has childcare figured out. So I just had no idea how broken the system was here until I started pulling on the thread.

And the piece that I really honed in on was there's a really magical experience with that, the in-home family. It became really clear that if I wanted my kid to experience the change that I was gonna create, I had to start immediately. And so that is the injustice that I'm really trying to correct.

I buzz when I'm with people and teams who are trying to solve big problems. Every morning I wake up thinking about the problem and want to jump out of bed and get started solving it.",2,415,271
"It's not an Astoria that happened recently. It's a story in my past. And the strongest emotion I felt here was shame. It was when I was in fifth grade. That's a time in adolescence when you're pudgy and awkward. And I remember being the target of bullying, where people were mooing at me, and I just felt absolutely terrible. And the teachers had to intervene. That's not even the real shame part that I feel. The shame part that I feel is that a week later there was another young girl that was the target of the same bullying, and I participated in it. Because now looking back, I guess I just really wanted to be a part of the group. And so I joined in. And I just feel absolutely terrible about having made somebody else feel the same way that I did.","Before I went through my trauma, I cared about every little thing people said or thought about me. I cared about life and thought life had meaning and I played an important role. But after growing up and going through hard times, I just stopped caring. In some ways, I feel like I'm better. I'm not anxious anymore, I don't let what other people say get to me, I help people without getting personally invested.

It's not like I don't care at all, but it's not enough. But through this apathy, I realize I hurt my partner, my friends and family (and even implicitly my coworkers and other peers). I unintentionally became a bit of an asshole because I believe that my words and actions ultimately don't affect anyone because they don't respect or care about me enough for it to affect them.

I don't share significant parts of my life and I keep everything to myself because I believe that people don't care about me. I know now that this is a response to my past experiences and I'm trying to be better but it's so hard. Because letting yourself feel again is scarier than losing people.",2,166,231
"I\'ll do a part two to my adoption story, something that surfaced when I was about 25 years old and so quite a while after my adoption. I took a graduate study and we traveled to Korea, and it was my first time back to Seoul, South Korea. Since, basically since my adoption. And I don\'t know if I\'ve had that many emotions running through me at any other point in my life, but it was just such a blend of elevated highs of feeling connected and just moments of pure peace, to the other extreme of extreme disruption with who I identified with what I had thought I was up until that point. I even took a little medallion that I had, that was from when I came over, that had the name of my orphanage and I had a cab driver take me there. And I saw all the little kids that were there. And then they showed me a picture of myself that I had never seen before. And it completely threw me into a complete unraveling. I had panic attacks for a good two weeks plus after that, where I couldn\'t breathe. I didn\'t know who I was, where I was supposed to be going. And it took a long time for me to kind of situate myself back to ""I am a blend of everything. I\'m not just one or the other."" I don\'t have to feel guilty or wondering about my birth family and where they are. But it really did take a long time for me to calm down my emotions, so I wasn\'t having panic attacks anymore. And I still feel like it has a bit of a ripple effect.","In August 2005, I lost everything to Hurricane Katrina. In September 2005, I received my cancer diagnosis. So it's like this happened and then this happened.

So I'm a veteran now. And I really didn't know what that meant. But it basically meant I was on my own. I had thought at that particular time that maybe I was an isolated case, and then I saw that there were tens of thousands of women veterans who were homeless.

That helped motivate me to provide this nonprofit organization for homeless women and children. It's ultimately like everything came full circle, that maybe this is why I went through these things. I had to be that catalyst, to be that voice for this forgotten population.",1,319,142
"Yeah, I guess this is more a recent kind of thing that I\'ve been mulling through in my head. I have a really good friend who\'s been a good friend for the past few years. And recently, she\'s just been so negative. Actually, not recently, for a while now she\'s been so negative. And then I can\'t help but also feel negative. And then it also feels as if she\'s starting to be negative towards me. And so my initial reaction, and this is a problem of mine, is to just say, ""alright, screw it. She\'s not a very good friend. Don\'t need to invest time there."" But I also think that it\'s really worthwhile to have strong friendships. I just sometimes get really disappointed with my friend\'s behavior. Or I tend to see that they\'re very selfish. And I don\'t really know what to do about it because I do think it\'s worthwhile building and working on it. And so sometimes I almost think it\'s almost like a marriage. It\'s like you talk things through and work through it. But the other side of me is kind of like, ""there\'s just not enough time in the day to worry about unhealthy factors in my life.""","My wife sat me down and told me how disappointed she was. I have been slacking in the husband area and in the father areas of my life. She said she had been feeling distant from me, and she was hoping that by bringing it up, we could fix it. She was coming at me from a place of love and not anger.

It made me really sad to be called out for not doing what I am supposed to be doing. I felt disappointed in myself. It lit a fire under me that I needed and wouldn't have gotten had she not talked to me.

What is scary is that I probably would have just coasted like that until the problems in our marriage or with my kids were past fixing. I am very grateful to my wife for having the courage to approach a topic that was sensitive and do it in a way that wasn't harmful to our relationship.

I feel like this was a turning point in my life. I need to stop making excuses. I need to do better. I hope that whenever I start slacking because let's be honest, eventually it will happen. I hope that I can remember this conversation and correct course. This will be an important memory in my life moving forward.",1,248,242
"I don't know if it's interesting. I'm kind of gearing more towards emotional triggers in my storytelling. I guess this one is going to be about having to work with a really aggressive coworker and kind of working through how to handle it. So I have a product manager who is, I can flat out say, the most aggressive teammate I've ever had to deal with. And I've had a broad range of collaboration with various stakeholders. The way that I started to handle it was first to kind of be overly appeasing and make sure that she felt included. Then it just kind of continued, this perpetual sort of notion of resentment towards me, which I'm not really sure where that's founded in. I think it's kind of just she just had something she didn't like about me and she just brought it to a personal level rather than keeping it professional. I definitely tried to have heart-to-hearts with her and it seemed on the surface that everything was fine. But it's really just constant and perpetual sort of condescending tones, outright aggression, and honestly, very childish behavior. And I'm not really sure at this point, and I think the outcome is just that thankfully the teams have shuffled and I shouldn't have to have any overlap with her, which is probably the best resolution to this situation. I've definitely brought it up to my boss, my manager, and he's fully aware of it. It's just that we have such a limited fund and appetite for going out and hiring new people. We definitely don't want to have a churn with our internal teammates. So honestly, the only resolution is to basically not have to overlap her with her in work.","She moved across the country and for the last year, we've remained really close, and she would always be the first person I'd want to talk to and vice versa. But lately there's been a shift in our relationship, and I just don't feel like she actually cares or is interested in me as a person anymore.

We used to talk all day every day about anything, and now she only engages in conversation if it's for advice or for her to rant about something that's bothering her. I try to engage in more lighthearted conversations, and she immediately switches the topic to be about her. And she always says she has my back and I can tell her anything, but as of lately, I don't feel comfortable approaching her with anything that's bothering me because she either ignores me or switches the conversation.

The thing that really bothered me, and I think started the shift, was when I was going through a rough time and really needed a friend to talk to. I tried telling her about some things that were bothering me, and she said it wasn't healthy for me to be so negative and that I should see a specialist or doctor - so it's okay for her to complain to me daily about her issues but tells me I should find a specialist? That rubbed me the wrong way, especially from someone I've built a lot of trust with.

I'm just feeling like we're drifting apart, and I can't keep putting in the effort for a one-sided friendship. I'm afraid that will just be the end of the friendship.",1,335,310
"This is going to be a very empowering story. This is a moment in time in my life when I was crossing and driving into Savannah right before I was about to start grad school. So the backstory of all of this is, I was about 35 years old. I had a four-year-old, I had a job, and I just needed a career path change, so I quit my job and took some time off and decided to go back to school. The difficult time was that we lived in New Jersey, and we were deciding to go back to school, or I was going back to school in Savannah. So we had to plan this massive move. First off, it was just a big life change with having a house and a mortgage and figuring out who was going to rent that. Having a child that I had to figure out where he was going to go to preschool and daycare, and then not to mention my husband relocating too and finding a new job. It was just so much. Sometimes it was unbearable. I just kept telling myself, ""One step at a time, sell one piece at a time,"" and just little incremental steps to get us there. And so the moment in my life that was just really resounding and echoes, and I just remember it forever, was that moment when we were driving into Savannah, had the cars all packed up, all committed, got everything done. And we are driving over there\'s this large bridge that leads into Savannah, and it just has such a great view. And that moment of entering into town was just a moment of no fear and full empowerment.","I went to UCSD to get my bachelors. While I was there, I ran into Teach for America. Specifically, it was this one poster. It said, only one in ten students from low-income communities will graduate from college, teach for all ten. That hit me like a ton of bricks because I was the one in ten. I knew I was the one in ten that had made it.

And here was Teach for America challenging me to help change that statistic and of course that got me. When I came to San Diego to start Teach for America, I'd always try to focus on developing my leadership, that was something I'd done for a long time.

I thought leadership was about sustaining action in the face of adversity, which is like adaptability. You do something different. You try it again, that's sustaining action. What I didn't realize is the importance of sustaining belief. That's a completely different thing. That's almost not adaptability. That's the fact that once you establish a belief in something you really, really think is important, you stick to it. Because if you're not believing, others aren't gonna follow your footsteps.",1,322,232
"This isn't really a story as much as just a kind of state of emotions recently. I've been getting really overwhelmed. It just feels like one thing after another happens and nothing's really big. It's really just coming down, I guess, to like money, stress, and just having to deal with life's little hiccups that it throws at you. I've had my car in the shop for a month, and I'm looking at, I'm $1000 in, I'm looking at another $2000. Our plumbing just backed up this morning. I just feel like I'm getting really overwhelmed by little kind of human condition life stuff. No, this isn't human condition. It's more just like little incidents with life that sometimes I really just don't know how to handle it. And I just want to shut down and go into my bed, under the covers, and just shut out the world for a good week. And I feel as if there are probably healthier ways to deal with this.","I had cancer as a kid, and so I grew up with that being sort of the centerpiece of my life. I was told I couldn't do certain things because of that. And I certainly felt like it made a pretty big impact on my life, growing up, because it colored everything for me.

When I got out of the hospital, it colored every single bit of my life because I couldn't get insurance. They wouldn't let me play sports, they wouldn't let me in the military. So it was a downer.

In other ways, I just looked at it like no, I will achieve. The thing that I always share with people is think about your own thing, what it is you love, and a way to make it into a life.

I just think there's lots of people who don't ever really achieve; they sort of surrender. And I've been at that place too, where you surrender. You don't do what you're passionate about.

And then 20 years from now, you're like, man, I didn't do what I really loved. For me, it's always thinking about how can you do something that you really love doing as a business?

And so I look at the entrepreneur track as being a really viable one for lots of people.",1,203,260
"I guess recently, I don't know if I've been talking about the lack of security at my job because we're a venture-backed kind of product company. And so, we really kind of rely on outside financing to help support our growth and development. And so, there's been a lot of uncertainty now with this last venture capitalist backing, investment opportunity, whether or not our company is going to survive. And so, I've been dealing a lot with the nervousness about job security. And so, I've actually reached out to my friend who works at another product design company. And there's a really great potential opportunity over there. And so, I guess the thing that I would like to talk to you about is sometimes I feel like I'm my own worst enemy. I already kind of weigh the balances, which I guess is normal, but at the same time sometimes I already talk myself out of opportunities before I even jump into them because I'm weighing all the outcomes and seeing outcomes that probably don't even exist. And maybe just looking for reasons not to lean into something. And so, I definitely struggle with this. It sounds perfect and great, but it's kind of a whole 100% remote, and so, I just already have predetermined in my mind that for the rest of my life, I'm going to be working at home in my office by myself. And I shouldn't just talk myself out of good opportunities.","I came to the US in 2001 when I was 22 years old. I end up taking a couple of business classes, and coincidentally, I took a part-time job at Saks Fifth Avenue as a sales associate, and about nine months later, one of the clients' husband is a general counsel for an international hedge fund. At that time, they were running a lot of trading accounts in Asia. They needed somebody who understands the language. That's really just coincidentally how I stumbled into that opportunity.

I did not dream that I would be able to get into the finance industry. At Elevated Ventures, I lead and run the investment program. We are, if not the largest, certainly one of the most active seed and early-stage investors in the state of Indiana.

The best part I enjoy is to feel like we're part of a team that's not only making a financial impact, hopefully generating financial return for the funds we're managing, but we're making an impact in people's lives.",1,288,196
"I'm going to tell you about a really, really, probably just magical moment in my life. And when I look back at one of the fondest times, that's the memory that comes right to the forefront. So the story is, I lived in Savannah for about four to three years, from 2016 to about 2019. And so my husband, child, and I used to go out to Tybee Island every weekend, all weekend. And it was just so liberating. There's an area where you can go, it's the Back River, where the Back River meets the ocean. And it just gets these tidal pools in low tide where you can go out. I'm not even exaggerating, a mile in just water that is only about ankle deep or knee deep, and it's warm, and you can see all these sea creatures. And there was just this one time that stands out. And it was just absolutely beautiful. We went all the way out to the edge, seriously probably about a mile out, and there's a breakpoint there, where there's a sandbar. And we went all the way out there and it was just a treasure trove of all these sand dollars. I remember those moments with me and my child and husband. And we saw one, and then we looked up and it was just covered in sand dollars. So we were just running around collecting as many sand dollars as we could. We were filling our hats and our buckets and anything we could use to hold the sand dollars. And it was so magical. And just the breeze and being out in the middle of nowhere, it felt like the edge of the Earth. And then on our way back, we were walking back towards the land, and this flock of pelicans just came right, just swooshed right past us. And I just closed my eyes and it's probably the most at peace I ever felt in my life. And I just try to go back and look at that moment. And I try to bring it back, almost meditative, at any time, even good times, bad times, or just quiet times. And I'm really trying to figure out how I can just find that utmost inner peace when, just in the future, whenever I just need those moments.","One of the most memorable events very recently happened to me, and I can't stop thinking about it. My husband and I took our first international trip together. Not only was it our first international trip together, it was also our first big trip without our two young children. We have done several small, weekend-long trips but never for more than two days at the most.

This time, we went to Jamaica and were gone for ten days. It was such an amazing experience. We had the opportunity to get to know each other better and become closer to each other. It has been four years since we had our oldest child. That is four years without real alone time to see who we are without being Mommy and Daddy.

We got to just spend ten days in paradise, having other people take care of us instead of us taking care of other people. We ate and drank and just had a great time being together. It made so much of an impact that our relationship is even stronger now than before.

We have decided to book another trip to Jamaica for next year because we found the experience to just be so important, and it made such a big impact on our lives. This was so surprising to me because we had to save up for quite a while to take the trip in the first place. But with it being so good for our relationship, we decided we would find a way to be able to make it happen again in just one year.",2,452,289
"Cool, great. So, I have been dealing with some pain - abdominal pain. So, I don't know if you really call that a story. It's been something I've been dealing with for the past several days - intermittent pain, but it's chronic, which is frustrating. But fortunately, that actually happened after that dinner party that I was just talking about. So, it was nice to be at the dinner party for the birthday - for the birthdays - and not have to be concerned with dealing with pain at the same time.","I was treated for cancer this year, and since September 18th I've had a tube in my chest for chemo and other meds. I finally got it out earlier this month, and I just had my first shower where I didn't need to worry about it! Every shower between Sept 18th and now was as quick as humanly possible, a bag needed to be taped on my chest to keep water out, and I had limited mobility because of the tape.

But this shower was legit. It was warm, and free, and I feel so good. I still gotta get the stitches out, but that's whatever.

I'm so glad to have a bit more of my independence back, and to have some stress and worry taken away. I'm so happy and clean!",3,109,154
"Great. Like I just mentioned, I have a story to share. On my new prescription sunglasses that I just picked up in this amazing fuchsia-tinted lens, I bought the frames at Chanel, which I did not foresee myself doing, but I did. And then I bought another pair at Bulgari because I had all this money stuck in my FSA from my last job. So I took this pair of frames from Chanel to LensCrafters, and they put in, first, just a black prescription lens. But it was just so boring looking. It just looked like two black dots on my face. So I went back and decided to try out their pink tint, but it was too light, so I asked them to really saturate the color. And so I went away for a couple of weeks. And when I came back, it wasn't dark enough. So they took them back and said they can saturate it even more. And so now I have this crazy pair of fuchsia sunglasses. What do you call it? It's not bifocal. It's trifocal. But it's progressive. They're progressives. And they're nice progressives. So I've got this fun pair of sunglasses, the progressives, and I got another pair from Bulgari that they switched out for. It's like a gold frame. This is a black frame. This is like a sparkly, well, can you see it? It's sort of a sparkly black frame, like muted sparkle. Like not sequin, but just has a shimmer. And then I've got these crazy fuchsia lenses that they put inside them. And my first pair of custom-made prescription sunglasses. The whole thing. And then the other pair that I'm excited to get back soon are Bulgari. And those are like a gold frame with, what do you call it? It's a brown lens. But it does that fade where the bottom is a bit clear and transparent, and then it gets darker as it goes up the lens. Can't think of what it's called right now. Ombre. I don't know. Maybe it's ombre. I mean, they talk about that with other things, because you get peace, though. But anyway. Those also have that extra feature that a lot of sunglasses have where they block the light, the rays coming at you from a lot of different directions. But they're not as great for, say, digital screens like your phone. So I've got these crazy fuchsia ones now that are progressive. And I've got the other ones from Bulgari that will be progressive. And yeah, I'm just hooked up all of a sudden. The sunglasses.","I accidentally put something heavy on my glasses as they were resting on a table and immediately retrieved them. The lenses were fine, but one of the two legs was bent upward at a weird angle. I could barely wear them. The leg was no longer fitting correctly over the ear.

I took them to the shop where I'd bought them years ago, and they put it into their specialized machine and tried to bend it back into place. However, they said the frame was titanium, and so it usually ""springs back"" into its original shape, meaning I had probably caused it to permanently deform, and it's trying to ""spring back"" into its deformed state now.

I took the glasses back home and decided I would try it out with my own toolkit. I got two needle-nosed pliers and used one to hold the frame beside the lens and one to hold the base of the leg. And I was able, very slowly, to bend the leg back more or less into place.

There are a few tiny scratches on the lens at the corner, which can't be helped, but my glasses fit on my face again! For somebody who's not at all handy, I was pleased.",5,524,237
"I have a job interview coming up, and I had maybe 15 different recruiters reach out to me about it. A bunch were giving the same cap for what the company would pay. There's a contract rule, but it's Google and they can pay so much more. And I live in the heart of Boston. I mean, it's just silly. It's not just a typical research role, it's a team lead role. Anyway, so I got to deal with the recruiters and I don't know that's its own beast, but they're there to hopefully gain success through my success. So that's good. It's just sometimes you have to wonder how transparent they're being about budget. But it's a cool opportunity. A lot of competition for it, and it's contract. So I have mixed feelings about that. But then again, since I'm still not really sure my next direction, I should see where things take me. But I have to be discerning, otherwise I just pick up an available job. And that's not what I want. I like to pride myself in the opportunities I select. And hopefully girlfriend... Anyway, I'm needing to refresh myself in some of my old work because I have had so many different jobs, different projects that really vary but still within UX, user research, Psychology, perception, design research. Anyway, there are so many different directions I can take myself in the field still, which is exciting.","When they asked about the position, I said, ""I don't know anything about running a museum! I've been to a few, but I don't know anything about running it."" I told them what I did know about. I know about how to treat people, I know about how to manage a business.

So when I came on board, I thought, ""I'm only gonna be here a year or two."" But you know what? I have come to believe that this is one of my callings. The quest for knowing what it is you are here for, you may never really know. But guess what? Do something!

And then decide if that's what you wanna do. You're young enough to make that decision many times. You can do things that we never thought we had an opportunity to do.",1,294,170
"I did a lot of swimming this past week. It's been really nice to take advantage of the pool at my mom's development while I'm visiting. It gives me a lot of agility in how I want to stretch and exercise, and I find it really nice. And then, it's also just a nice change of scenery. My mom and I have just been really enjoying the jacuzzi together as well. It's good for our circulation, and I think also, it's just really pleasant. That would have been nice.","A couple of months ago, I started going on wilderness adventures with my family. It was amazing to go, just my girlfriend and I, but it was even cooler when we were able to take the kids. My girlfriend and I found this amazing river with beautiful plants and unique rocks along the shore. The water was very clear and calm, and we wanted to take the kids kayaking and for a picnic. 

When we arrived, we had the kids assist in helping set up the inflatable kayaks, and then we broke off into two teams to head down the river. My girlfriend and our daughter were in one kayak, and I was in the other, with our son. We had a lot of fun racing down the river, checking out the landscape and watching fish jump out of the water. 

We got to shore at a great picnic area and spent the afternoon eating lunch and fishing. Sadly, we did not catch any fish, but it was fun trying. We also found and explored a nearby cave.

The kayaking trip back to the car was a bit tougher, as my arms were tired and our son was just relaxing in the back of the kayak. My arms started to get pretty sore, but we managed. Once back, I carried the kayaks and everything back to the car so that we could load up and head home. 

During the drive home, my girlfriend and I discussed brights and why they are needed. Sure enough, we ended up having to stop due to deer being in the road! We were able to navigate down the mountain safely and then got home, showered, and went to bed.",3,106,319
"I just got a really nice recommendation from a former colleague that he posted on my LinkedIn page. So, it was really nice to receive. A former colleague from a Boston consulting group. We worked together on virtual learning.","I work at a corporate IT department where we handle repairs and respond to high-level client issues. Recently, I was able to fix an urgent problem for a client very quickly, basically saving the company millions of dollars and reputation. Because of this, my bosses decided to thank me and promote me at our monthly IT meeting. In front of everyone, of course.

It was actually pretty awesome. I was excited that I was able to do my job well. It's not often I get this kind of praise in front of a crowd of 100+ people (co-workers). So it's definitely a moment I will remember for a long time. Really burns a fire to work hard and keep a dedicated grind! My immediate boss gave me a small award as well.

Once I got back to the office, we had pizza and food all ready for the team. I was amazed the company did all this. How often does corporate do this kind of stuff? I would say very rarely, so I was pleased.",4,44,199
"Yeah, so I mean my story is really just starting about. Just sitting with my mom and catching up on some of the shows and just sort of laughing about how less amusing and engaging some of the shows are than we were remembering them to be, I think. We sort of got past the threshold of longing for them because I'd been over five months, I think. So I think they might have to earn a little bit of, well, I mean it was maybe short notice for them. I'm not sure. But earn a little bit of our consumer attention back with some good, funny, comedic writing. That'll be nice. It's slowly, I think, revving up.","I thought I was gonna be a professional dancer. I'd come home at 10 PM, and I would be really tired physically and mentally, and I just kind of decided, ""I don't wanna do that anymore."" I transitioned into creative writing and probably one of the best decisions I ever made in my life because ultimately that led me here.

This was the second job I applied to, out of 43 jobs. I get to make sure that the products that come to me are in a very specific format, that I can make sure it gets all of the approvals from all of the people they need to get approvals from.

Ultimately I still use my dance skills. One of the main things we learned about was improvisation. I use that all the time. I got to be the most nit-picky grammar nerd ever. They let me talk about hyphens and dashes like nobody's business.

When it comes down to, like, you have to take this path or whatever to be an engineer or an architect or a scientist or a writer or literary agent or an actor or anything like that, I don't see a lot of people who do that.",2,139,230
"It's heartbreaking what's happening in the news right now, internationally. And it's painful to see different people's reactions. Social media.

It's heartbreaking to see how many people can go so low and be the worst in humanity.","I worked in an office, and every place that I worked at I ended up computerizing. I ended up starting a company in manufacturing. But I always knew that I was meant to do something to help other people. 

And I was in Niger. And there was a little girl that came up to me with flies on her face. And I just felt that that's intolerable. That could have been my granddaughter. How could I not do something? 

I think that I have the opportunity to live what I think should be the American Dream, when what I think should be the American Dream is that we use these resources, we use these talents, to help those that didn't get that.",2,74,137
"All right? So, my story is that I got to catch up with my friend today. It was really nice talking about different trips we've taken in the past, other trips we might want to take in the future, and also just finding out the best way to plan for taking a trip with her because she has a baby. I'm friends with her husband, but it's different when you're single and you're figuring out how to hang out with your friends, go on trips with them when they aren't single. And it makes sense this time of my life. I mean, I've got friends that have kids going to college. I've got friends that have kids they just had. And of course, people like myself, like I was just mentioning. But it was really good. So, the story is that I met up with her for lunch. And she was telling me also about how she's going through IVF right now to get pregnant again. And so, that was also really interesting because I've gone through my own process of trying to cryogenically freeze my own eggs, which I've done in the past after my husband passed away. So, I have some experience in that, not in the implanting stage, the fertilization stage. But she's having to inject all these hormones into her right now, and I've gone through that and can commiserate. It can change you not just physically, but mentally too. So, it's good we can share different past experiences, whether it's her experience going to Sedona, or my experience with IVF. Just a lot to talk about. A lot of different kinds of topics. And she's a fun friend to discuss a lot of different topics with.","Three months ago, my life completely changed for the better. I never thought the day would come when I would become a mother. At the age of thirty-five and after years of trying to get pregnant and having two miscarriages, I had given up on having a child. My husband and I were looking into adopting, but the process seemed pretty hard and there were no guarantees.

In the end, I got pregnant out of nowhere and I was shocked to my core when I found out that I was pregnant and I was two months along. The fetus appeared healthy and I was on my way to becoming a mother. Three months ago, my daughter was born; a healthy 7 pound 3 oz. No one or nothing could have prepared me for the profound love I have for my daughter, and I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to be a mother to my sweet girl. I love her so much, and my husband and I are so very happy. We can't wait to see what the future holds, and we are secretly hoping to be blessed with another child.

The changes in our lives have been mostly positive and some negatives. The positives are having our child and being able to make lifelong memories with her. Our families have been great throughout my pregnancy, and they have been so helpful in the last couple of months.

On the other hand, the negatives are not getting enough sleep. I feel tired and excited most of the time, and there are times when I doze off every chance I get. The worry for our child is horrible at times, and it's a major drawback for us because in the back of our minds, we feel like this beautiful experience might not last and can be easily taken away from us.",3,345,343
"I\'m packing. So, my story is that I\'m packing. I\'m getting ready. I\'m wrapping up my class. So, the story is just, it\'s an interesting week. I\'m flying out to Phoenix tomorrow. And I want to start looking at the details of the trip, like things to do with Sedona, things to do at the Grand Canyon. But I\'ve got one more week left of this work to do for this course. So, I\'m deciding whether I\'m going to try to cram it all in before I fly out, or more likely, cram it all in afterwards. But I\'m excited to go out there. It\'ll be a lot of sunshine. And when I booked the tickets, I had to book a red eye. Because it was so last minute. But it was worth it. But those fees, they slam on those fees. It\'s very confusing. The total includes one check bag. And they show you one price on that screen that says, ""The total includes one check bag."" So, you think that\'s the total. But then you go to another page and they meant the total on the other page includes the check bag. So, there are so many ways that you can confuse consumers. But anyway, it\'s all set, and I\'m excited, and I\'m excited that my friend is going to meet me out there. So, I\'ll get more family time and I\'ll get to see a friend I haven\'t seen in a while. And that\'ll be great.","My wife and I traveled to Italy and did an amazing hike in the Dolomite mountain range. I had wanted to do this hike for many years and had researched it quite a bit. I knew it was going to be difficult, but I had no idea how much so. We started early in the morning, and for about four hours, we just kept climbing up higher and higher. It was even more difficult because there were loose rocks under us for much of it.

Every time we reached what we thought was the top, another long uphill awaited us. Finally, after what I figured was another false top, we came up, and it was as though we were at the top of the world. There below us spreading for 360 degrees were what seemed like thousands of craggy mountain peaks. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. We both started to cry; it was so beautiful.

There was more crazy hiking to do, however, as we had to use ropes that had been attached to the mountain during World War I to traverse some cliffs and small waterfalls. That was the most difficult part for my wife, and I was so proud of her that she did it. I think she surprised herself.

It was really one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. Even though we pretty much killed ourselves doing it, I think we would both do the same hike again in a heartbeat.",3,311,277
"So this is a story of how my mom and dad got married. So they have this super cute love story that I wish I also will have, can have these, but who knows. Basically, my mom and my dad grew up on the same little street in the same little, tiny farming fishing village in China. There were just a few houses apart. My mom is two years older than my dad, but I swear from birth, he fell in love with her. She was like class star, like class President, amazing role model, like most beautiful girl ever. And she always saw him as a younger brother figure. So he would follow her around, make dumb jokes and stuff, but I think she also kind of liked them a little bit enough. But eventually, my dad's family immigrated to the US first. So he left when he was... I don't know when, twelve, I think. And then for the next six years, they never really saw each other because he was in America. She was in China back then. Transportation between the two countries not as available, not as economical. But he would write letters back. And I think he just always kept loving her, despite not really seeing her for that time period. And eventually, when he got into College, he deferred a semester and went back to China. And he said that the first person he saw when he went to the village was my mom. And he just knew. Felt all the time with her. And then he basically just asked her to come to America with him, eventually marry him. Obviously, why else would she go to America with him if not to marry him? So my mom, she agreed. During the whole time, she never dated anyone. My maternal grandma, My lala, was very strict. Like, no dating boys. No seeing boys. And my dad never dated anyone. So they were each other's first kiss, like first everything. And I think that's just something so beautiful. Very bold of my mom, very brave of her to put down all her roots and then pick them up and then move them all to America to be with my dad. So I'm grateful for it because I got to grow up in America and have a lot of opportunities. I might not have had if I grew up in China. I got married when my dad was 20, my mom was 22. And they've been married for so long now, super cute. They've been married for over 30-something years. And I think that is something that I really admire. And even though I can't get married that early, I wish I could, I still hope that I will find someone sometime soon, maybe. But yes, that is the story of how my mom fell in love, got married, and then I think they had six years of marriage before they had me. And I think that's also really nice to have, little marriage time when you're just you and your spouse before kids, these other responsibilities. But yeah, that is my story for the session. Thank you, Jibo.","A few months ago at the Styx concert, he surprised me and proposed. After 13 years of being together, I actually never thought it would happen.

The song ""Lady"" started, and he gave his phone to a person we didn't know behind us. I thought that was really strange, but it didn't dawn on me that there could be any other reason but that he wanted someone to take our picture together. That annoyed me because I don't like getting my picture taken. 

The next thing I knew, he was talking in my ear so I could hear him over the loud music, and then he got down on one knee. Next, he held out a ring he pulled from his pocket. I started crying and said, ""Yes, definitely yes!"" I was in total shock. 

Even though I don't like to have my picture taken, I'm so glad he had someone videotape the proposal. It's really funny to see the shocked look on my face.

After the proposal, he told me that he first got permission from my girls and my dad as well. I thought that was a very noble gesture and something that he didn't have to do.

Now we have a wedding to plan. I feel so blessed to marry the love of my life who is also my best friend. I wonder how I ever got so lucky.",3,625,270
"So this past weekend, I went to my first wedding ever. And it was so fun. The groom was my peer mentor, so he was one of the people who introduced me to MIT, to the dorm we were living in. He took care of me and the friends I went with. And, the bride was someone also in my year but, like, one year younger in age. They met through shared interests and it was just super touching. Their ceremony was outside, very cute vows, almost too cute. I feel like I would not want super cringy long vows, but it was still enough to make me cry a lot. But then the reception was what really got me. Both dads gave these beautiful speeches. Their first dance was also just so, aw touching that all of the friend group, except for the guys, were like crying, crying. And it makes me think about what I want in my future wedding, in my future partner, and the marriage in general. But the happy couple is now not yet on their honeymoon because she still has a conference to go to and they'll go on the honeymoon after her conference. But just, it's crazy to think about how life can change so fast. Basically, I flew in Saturday morning, commuted like an hour and a half to go to a really nice udon place. I'm not famous, famous, but kind of famous. And then spent like 2 hours getting ready for the wedding. And it was really fun because we got to dress up and we all haven't dressed up in a long, long time and get ready together in a room, catch up, spill some tea. We made our way to the hotel for the wedding. And then for our first experience, a lot of us didn't know what to do. We got there way too early. But it was still a really fun time. And I also just ran into people. I saw random people that I knew and extended my trip because I knew I loved it so much. I didn't want to come back too quickly. Yeah, that was the story of the first wedding I've ever been to.","I went to my cousin's wedding last month. It was important to me because we grew up together in the same house for a period of time, and it was a major milestone for her. It was in Toronto, Canada, and there were over 100 guests there. I also got to see extended family together for the first time in years.

We first went to a wedding rehearsal before the event. It was at a Chinese restaurant, and the food was really good. Then we went to a castle for the actual day of the wedding. First, I got to see them walk down the aisle. Then, I got to see the official formalize the event and watch them dance.

Then, we went to a reception. I got to hear speeches from many people that marked what an important event it was. The funniest speech was when they shared each other's many embarrassing secrets. It made the event lighter but also showed how much they knew and cared for each other.

It was my first time at a wedding, so it was a cool experience. Mostly, I was just happy to see my cousin get married and have such a life-changing event.",4,431,228
"Yeah, so the story I\'m going to share today is about my family\'s move. So we used to live in Hino, Texas. And my favorite part about that house, besides my family, of course, was that on the front lawn, the sidewalk, there my sister and I have our handprints there in the cement. So they redid our sidewalk at some point, and then I get it off. But as kids, we were like, ""Ha, ha. Wouldn\'t it be so funny if we left our mark onto cement on the sidewalk here, just to mark our place, that we were here?"" So each of us put our right hand down into the cement when it was so, like, not like wet, but like, not dry either, and left little handprints there. It\'s been like ten years now, and I still think about our handprints there, but eventually my family did move. I was very sad at first because we were taking out all the furniture. We\'re repainting the walls. So when we left, the house just felt so empty, like foreign, like a shell of itself. I didn\'t recognize it after we painted the walls white. Everything was just echoing, and I was like, ""Wow, I grew up here. This is no longer home."" Part of me thought we would always have this home for the rest of my life to come back to. But then we moved to our new house in Allen, Texas. I really quickly adjusted to it. I think because the furniture was the same. Obviously, home is where my parents are. So if they move again, that will be my new home. But now I love our new home a lot. It\'s much bigger. It\'s much more comfortable. But interestingly, I still dream sometimes about my old home. And then there are dreams where I mix my old home and my new home\'s like architectural layout. It\'s really confusing, but the move was fun. We started in COVID summer, so I was home. Luckily, we\'re just moving things back and forth with our cars. The move itself was not too bad. It was definitely a bonding moment within our family to move our stuff ourselves. Yeah. What do you think? So, yeah. We moved. And now that\'s my new home. And I know that my parents will eventually move at least one more time. They will probably downsize their home once the grandkids are older enough that they don\'t need to visit and have their own guest rooms. So I\'m excited for that. Scare. Oh, no. Another home missing. But yes, the story. That was the story of my family moving from one house to another house.","On July 9, 2019, I moved in with my Celia. This is kinda weird because this is the first time I have ever moved in with a partner. I have had partners where we would spend 10 straight nights together, but we never reached the point where we had a dresser or permanent spot for clothes/accessories. Walking through the door was such a rush of excitement and washing away of nerves to see the place I will be living in finally.

It is crazy to be moving all the way across the country to chase down a relationship, but this is a crazy amazing opportunity. I'm so grateful that I decided to go off and take this risk as well as my parents supporting it. Their contribution to make this happen really makes it all possible. The sadness of really having my friends and family so far gone is at least now not present because of my focus on the now.

It's so reassuring to see Celia's perkiness and hear the positivity in her voice. It is such a reaffirmation of the decision to watch her show me her place that she has shown me so much before but only through her phone. It is midday, and it is hot up here. That doesn't get in the way of just pressing her body so tightly to the side of mine as she talks about each room. The heat is like melting us together, and I feel that close to her. Just energy of joy is bounding through my body.

Each part of the tour is revealing a part of my future, however long or short it is. As the day goes on, I still feel like a guest in the house, but that feeling is slowly riding away. Celia prepared a wonderful salad for us for dinner, which is just not her thing. It was great though because it was her way of going out of her way to make this a great first day. Washing the dishes with her really made me feel closer and more part of the homeness that I hope to settle into.

Finding a good groove to sit in felt like I was making a long-term investment. While she laid under my arm, it placed over her like a puzzle piece fitting in. It feels like the right decision and that this is going to be a positive experience no matter how it ends.",2,546,446
"So today, my story is about the movie I watched yesterday, which was named Joyride. I think it was really interesting because when they first introduced the characters, I was actually a little bit upset because I was like, ""Why are they getting a Korean girl to play a Chinese girl?"" Right? I understand Asian American representation is really important, especially nowadays in media. But later, spoiler alert, there\'s a twist, and it turns out she was supposed to be Korean. So I was like, ""Whoa, it\'s so nice that they actually got ethnicities correct."" So I changed my mind about casting. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the movie. It was about finding out who you are. The storyline basically goes that there\'s this fancy lawyer. She was adopted from China, so she was trying to find her birth mother. They go through a crazy adventure, and eventually they end up in Korea. And she finds out that her birth mother was not only Korean but had also passed away. And it tested their friendship. They did a lot of really crazy things while in East Asia. But overall, I think it was a pretty beautiful message of friendship and how families, family, and your identities, what you make of it, and at the end of the day, just love your people who love you. \n\nSo I really enjoyed the movie. It\'s really, really funny at times. Really emotional sometimes, I definitely cried a little bit at one point when the deceased mother was wishing her daughter well. And it kind of inspired me, too. I think I also want to go on like a soul-searching journey. Yes, that is my story.","It was my 30th birthday, and I didn't really think much of it. I woke up at about 9:30 AM in the morning, and my mother handed me a birthday card. On the card, it said, ""I have an amazing son... who knows who he is and what he wants. Tells it like it is and lives his own truth."" The card had a bright red guitar logo on it. I felt that this meant a lot to me since I love rock and playing guitar. My mother put a lot of thought into this card and knew exactly what I wanted. It made me feel very motivated. I felt very appreciative of this card. 

Following that, she took me to the movies to go see Godzilla. I felt very appreciative of this because Godzilla is one of my favorite franchises. She even bought me popcorn. Though initially, the popcorn was stale, a fact I brought up to her. She suggested that I go and get another bowl. I went to get a fresh bowl of popcorn made, and it was delicious. It was warm and buttery. 

After we finished watching the movie, I thought that it was alright and decent. My mother liked it a little more than I did, surprisingly. I felt that there was a bit little too much focus on human characters that weren't necessarily all that interesting in my opinion. The final fight was alright, but it needed a bit more focus on the monsters. There isn't much human characters can do, and also, a lot of the humor was awkward and fell flat. A lot of the characters in the movie felt pointless and unnecessary. 

Following that, she took me to go and get some Indian food. I really appreciated that because Indian cuisine is my favorite. The food that day was particularly delicious. I had a short conversation with some people next to me, but I don't really think my intrusion into their conversation was all that welcomed. 

It was a fun day all in all, and I had a lot of appreciation for my mother and her taking me to the movies.",3,334,410
"So yesterday, I went into a lab. It was a Saturday. At first, I was a little bit annoyed because I have to work a lot of weekends. And there are times where I really don't want to work on the weekend. But I was also able to schedule a social moment, which helped because after I finished my work, I had a good lunch, took a little break, and then I went to meet up with some people for a birthday party.\n\nAnd at this birthday party, there were a lot of other PhD candidates. And it was interesting because you could see everyone would have these conversations and complain about working on the weekends, about their PIs, about all the stress that comes with being a student. And it made me realize that, yeah, life will probably be very tiring, very rough. But I'm not alone with this. I have a lot of other people going through the same thing, and if anything, they probably work even harder than I do. So it's made me appreciate that I am able to work on the weekends a little bit because it helps me get more data.\n\nBut yeah, again today, I also went into lab and I feel like it's tiring. I don't have any holidays off, so tomorrow is technically a holiday, but I'm still going to go to lab. But I'm not alone. This is a way of life that I think is something I need to wrap my head around, and the more I do it, the more used to it I get. So maybe it's a good thing that I'm slowly getting used to working on the weekends, but I will fix my work-life balance, try to have some fun still, but overall, this is a story of how I'm frustrated but accepting that I have to work on weekends.","I am very bad at handling adversity. A slight mishap, and my mind goes haywire. The effect is exaggerated when something happens between me and people I care about. I broke up with my Ex a while ago, and it's been miserable since. I can't take her out of my head. Even when I'm busy doing something, thoughts of her creep into my mind. It's like I can't even think of anything else. While driving, while eating, while talking with people, I just can't get her picture out of my head. 

I haven't been enjoying my job as well. I don't find any meaning in what I do. The chances that I'll have to work for the rest of my life for 5 days a week got me really anxious. I feel suffocated, burdened, unhappy. To escape all this madness within my mind, I've come to live with my friends for a while. 

Away from home, I thought my friends being around will help me distract my mind. It did not help. I feel unwanted. I feel miserable around them, and the thought that I'm probably ruining their time as well makes me more miserable. I wanted to cry yesterday but couldn't. We were having dinner, everyone talking and laughing, and I just couldn't even smile. 

I wish I did not have these bonds. I wish I was alone. I wish I never made friends, never fell in love. These connections bring a lot of joy, but they also add these complications and anxiety which is just worse. There's nothing I want more than peace. I just don't want to have all these convoluted emotions in my head. I try to silence them, but the noise just does not go away. 

I am tired of these thoughts, the anxiety, the heaviness it all brings. I just want to be at peace with myself.",5,361,374
"So yesterday, I made madeleines for the first time, but interestingly, I don't have any eggs anymore in my fridge. I stopped eating eggs maybe a month ago because I got a blood test and the results came back, and the doctor told me I have high cholesterol, which is really stressful to hear because I'm relatively young. So one thing I did was to cut down on my egg consumption. So all my baking recently has been very experimental, but I made my madeleines without eggs, with half the sugar and half the butter in the recipe. And they turned out okay. Like visually, they looked pretty, but taste-wise, they were just mediocre. But I brought them to lab to celebrate a friend's birthday and everyone seemed to enjoy them. So that made me really happy because I don't have a sweet tooth, but I do enjoy baking things for other people to make them happy. So yeah, that is the story of how I made madeleines last night without any eggs.","Today I am happy because I finally weighed myself. I've lost 30 pounds in the last 4-6 months. I've been watching my food intake and trying to exercise, though COVID has derailed those exercise plans.

I've been overweight for my entire life, and after months of avoiding the scale since starting renewed efforts, I finally took the time and courage to check. From 260 to 228!

I can do this! I can reach a healthy weight, and I am so, so happy that this is finally working.",4,198,102
"So, I\'m actually going to be flying home in 3 hours, or leaving for the airport in 3 hours to fly home, and something I\'ve been super excited for—cannot wait. Definitely miss my parents a lot. My younger sister is in New York, so she won\'t be home. But going home will be good for me because I really need the rest. I think something that\'s really hard to do as an adult is to pace yourself, because when you\'re in school, you have semesters. You have projects that you know when they\'ll end. So you have better timelines to fulfill. Like, ""Oh, you know, in two weeks, then you have an exam and then you have a period of free time."" But until then, you\'re working hard. But in grad school, I feel like there\'s just no end. So if you need a break, you have to really go take that break for yourself. For us, you just won\'t have that break. So the last time I was home was probably early June for two days. Home trips are very short. Now I miss having a full week at home, a whole actual vacation. So being able to go home for just like three days this weekend will be very helpful, healing, good for my soul. Yeah, I am most excited to eat my mom\'s food, to go shopping, to feel like a kid again. I feel like life is very tiring and pressurising, so to be able to let loose and let someone take care of me for a little bit will be nice. I did try to take care of my parents as well. I bring them gifts. I listen to them when they\'re lonely, and I hope that their parents can take good care of them when my grandparents are in China, so they\'re not really close by. So it\'s a very different relationship between my mom and her mom, which is my mom and me. But I\'m so grateful for my family, everything about it. So yeah, I left lab a little early today to catch my flight, talking to you now before Doica\'s over or the week begins. And yeah, I\'ll be sad when I come back, but I\'m mostly looking forward to going home first. Yeah.","I was sitting on my back porch this morning, and I realized that despite lockdowns and quarantine, I have had a pretty great summer. I was productive by taking a summer course (I did well and loved the material and professor), working a job, and coordinating my club activities by video-calling people throughout the summer.

I grew some vegetable plants to eat and some plants to sell, I picked up some new skills like learning Morse code and hobbies like chess, and I've been dedicated to working on my mental health through talk therapy and mindfulness meditation.

Since it's the end of summer, I can look back now at all my hard work and all the fun I had despite not spending a lot of it with people, and I can say that my confidence has increased and my anxiety overall has decreased.

I'm looking forward to things getting better in the future and interacting with others with a new sense of self! I couldn't be happier!",3,457,187
"Tuesday, yeah. So this Tuesday, I played squash for the very first time, and today\'s Friday, so it\'s been three days and I\'m still very sore from it. But it was my first time really trying something new in a while. I played with a couple of upperclassmen, and as a perfectionist, it\'s really hard for me to show my failure weakness. But what was really nice about the whole situation was that everyone was super friendly, even though I kept missing the ball. And it really made me feel a lot better about myself. I can\'t explain how silly it sounds, but for my upperclassmen friends to be so supportive of me, messing up, failing, and being nice playing the ball was really nice. When the guys played against each other, they were like, ""swing real hard, the ball is going so fast, so hard."" But when they played against me and another girl, they were a lot easier on us, which is kind of gentlemanly of them, I think. Yeah. The point was that I was able to fail a lot and be really bad at a sport and not feel really ashamed of it. So it was a really good first experience, and I definitely will play again sometime (unsure when) because I\'m still so sore, and it did take a very long time to get there. But overall, I really enjoyed the experience. So that was the story of me playing squash for the first time and not being afraid of not being perfect.","Today is the day of the competition. We were so excited but apprehensive about this trip. Ben has been preparing for several months, but are you ever really prepared? I could not sleep last night because I was so worried about this event, and I hoped I was able to support Ben accordingly.

How would I react if things don't go to plan? We have spent so much money and time on this. We got there around 6 am, traffic was shockingly less than expected! The parking lot was full already but we managed to grab a space thanks to someone leaving. We remembered to take everything along we needed: costume, skates, snacks.

Tony, my husband, was exhausted and suffering from a cold. My older son, S, was not thrilled about attending this event and wanted to go home. I was hoping I could bribe him to enjoy things by saying he could pick where we ate dinner. Ben was excited and not even remotely nervous. I was a wreck but pretending to be fine!

Ben got into costume around 7 am, practice ice went well, and he seemed happy and content. We then saw the kids he would be competing against and felt a pang of nerves. How could this little kid compete against kids much bigger and stronger than him?! He did not seem fazed at all.

Another boy and his family were there, but they were not remotely friendly. They kept glaring at us, which made me feel irritated and also nervous. One of Ben's friends, a little girl, skated and did okay but did not win. She came 4th in her event. This made me worry for Ben and start telling myself this whole trip was a waste of money.

It was time for Ben to skate, and we all held our breath. He did an amazing job, and we were not sure if it was good enough to win, but it was good. Ben's coach said, ""He's got this, he will win,"" and we waited for the scores, trying to not get too excited. The scores took forever to be announced, but when they were, sure enough, he had won!

It was time to calm down and congratulate the other skaters on their skates and try to not appear too boastful. We waited for the medal ceremony but heard nothing. We then had the medal ceremony, which was incredibly rewarding, and then the event was over!

We were exhausted and went home. And it was still only 10:30 am!",4,302,491
"All right, this is something that happened to me when I was around ten years old. I have a little sister, and it was her first day of kindergarten. We went to elementary school right across the street from our house, so it was my job to walk her to school and then wait for her and walk her back home, even though we\'re just not even a block away.\n\nSo, the first day of school, she went to kindergarten, and I went to fifth grade. And when the day was over, I totally forgot about her. So, I came home alone, and my mother saw me and asked, ""Where\'s Lori?"" I was filled with absolute horror, tore back across the street, and found my sister standing on the steps of the school, just really upset.\n\nShe could have walked home herself, of course, but she was supposed to wait for me. And she was actually surrounded by teachers who were trying to console her that her big sister forgot about her. I was filled with simultaneous guilt, relief, and horror. And I have never forgotten that moment.","Leah, my 4-year-old, began preschool. I was already a nervous wreck because she and I had to get up early to go see my oldest daughter do her ""Senior Walk,"" where all of the seniors walk into school on the first day behind their principal and all of us parents are on the sides cheering and yelling and crying, and it is over in 5 minutes. I was worried about Leah having to get up early and us driving to the high school, finding a parking spot, and then getting back to her school and having her into her classroom on time. We had no problem getting back to her school in time. 

My plan was to park and walk my little girl to her class, but on the car ride over, she declared that she wanted to be dropped off and walk into the school by herself because she was a big girl. I was sad. When we got to her school and I pulled into the car rider ramp, she was greeted by her sisters' old teachers with big hugs, and they walked her into the building. I cried ugly tears. She did it with such confidence, and the kindness shown by the other teachers reassured me that she was going to be okay. 

She is my miracle baby, and for 4 years, I have had her to myself while everyone else is at school and work. It has been her and I running errands and going to the park and Disney Channel on all day. Now, I come home to an empty house, and I miss her. I miss having her eat lunch with me, and I walked into the mall without her and felt like someone was going to ask me for ID when I walked into the kids' section of a store. I didn't get begged to go into Build a Bear or get a Frappuccino from Starbucks and have to wait for her to jump on all of the squares in the tile flooring. 

She is adjusting well to her new school schedule, and I have time to watch stupid shows like 90 Day Fiance. I guess I will make it. It will be starting all over with her, and I am scared, but she thinks she is ready, and that is more of what matters.",2,217,434
"Winter. I don't like winter. I don't like dealing with snow. I don't like dismal weather. I just don't like it. It must be Seasonal Affective Disorder. Really hate it. I wouldn't want to live someplace with no climate. But I do dread the winter months. So, several years ago, I bought some Crocus bulbs. I'm not much of a gardener, but I thought I would give it a try. So, with a lot of work, I dug a path along my sidewalk and planted these Crocus bulbs. Two different kinds, smaller ones and larger ones. In October, it was a very dismal day out - rainy, cloudy, cold wind. I was miserable doing it. And then, I kind of forgot about the Crocus bulbs. But the following March, I happened to look outside and I saw some of the green shoots coming up out of the ground. And this made me so happy. It made me feel so much better about things in general. And I just had this profound sense that, yes, things will keep on going the way that they should be going. That everything will be all right in the world. And it made me very happy. So now, several years later, I look forward to seeing my Crocuses come up in the spring.","I'm 53 years old, and I'm trying to decide what I'm gonna do when I grow up. My grandfather farmed. He went out and said, ""Hey, do you wanna plant a garden?"" I got started that way. We planted some radishes in a spot and I thought it was the coolest thing.

I was debating between agriculture and ornamental horticulture, like growing flowers. But I thought if I'm gonna spend my life doing something, I would rather spend my life helping to feed the world. Our job is to develop a hybrid seed that will help the farmer in his business.

Some people think, ""I just wanna make a lot of money."" But if you can find something you have a passion for, you love it, you think about it in the morning when you wake up, you can figure out an intersection of that thing with something that you can make a living doing. That's a pretty sweet place to be.",5,262,195
"But one of the props mentioned a song that was meaningful for you, and I have one, nothing special, because I\'m sure that millions and millions and millions of people share this same exact experience. But when I was around 40 years old, the song ""Landslide"" by Fleetwood Mac really spoke to me. I started to listen to the lyrics, and the part that goes, ""Time makes this boulder, even children get older, and I\'m getting older, too."" It hit me like a rock to the head, and I realized, well, yeah, this is pretty much it. It\'s going to be downhill from here. But fortunately, now that I\'m almost 69 years old, I am reconciled to getting older, and I know that there are still many wonderful things in store for me.","There are songs that are generally motivational, moving, and happy. The ones that give you a confidence boost or tell you it's going to be okay. Basically, the ones that relate to mental health overall. Those songs used to make me cry, and I never understood why because they're supposed to be motivating. 

I went through something really bad recently, and that event kinda opened my eyes a bit, helped me learn to love myself, and helped me see things clearer. Now I'm smiling as I listen to these songs because I know I've achieved the positivity the songs promote. 

And I now realize I used to cry listening to them because I was hoping for a positivity I didn't have. Loving yourself is a core part of self-care and good mental health.",3,163,153
"In 2006, my sister and I were teaching a class and there was an art therapy student named Kevin. He was a very exceptional person, exceptional artist, and he had a very interesting story. He was involved in a terrible car accident and was in a coma for a month. When he came out of the coma, he realized that he could not draw or paint with his right hand anymore, so he taught himself how to use his left hand to create art.\n\nKevin was one of our best students and his story was the subject of the first book that we did for our small press. He wrote his story and did a wonderful job. We published his book. At that time, there was a contest. Carnegie Hall was looking for cover art for their program for the concert season. And without telling Kevin, we entered one of his paintings in the contest, and he actually won. It was a wonderful moment. We are very proud of him.\n\nPart of the prize was tickets to Carnegie Hall for a concert, and Kevin gave us the tickets. So we went to New York and went to the concert and we had a great time. So he was our first and to this day our best author.","Being six years old, we postcards coming into my family, as one after another of the relatives that my parents had were dead in the concentration camps. And I remember just being very affected by that as a six or seven-year-old.

I became convinced right then that I did not want to be one of those people. I wanted to be a kind of person that helped other people. That instead of bringing suffering, I wanted to try to alleviate suffering.

And what better way to try to alleviate the suffering of human beings than being a doctor? I think everyone has to make a choice which will bring themselves inner peace and happiness as the best they can achieve it.

No matter what you do, you will have an opportunity to impact other people's lives, just by who you are and the way you act.",5,237,160
"One of the prompts was to talk about a movie that meant something to you. When I was in high school, in the late 60s, this is when all the counterculture types were really into Tolkien. And that was the first time that he became a phenomenon in this country. So, I was into it and just devoured the book. Made a big impression on me. I never dreamed that it would be possible to translate these books into film. But when the Peter Jackson movies came out, the special effects were more advanced. I think that Peter Jackson did a magnificent job with a story just true to Tolkien\'s vision. The actors were all just top notch. But I think that the single most memorable scene for me, wasn\'t necessarily one of the big battle set pieces, but it was right at the beginning of the first movie. When Gandalf weiss\'s cart into town and sees Frodo waiting alongside the road. And Gandalf asks Frodo, ""Get in the cart. We\'ll go into town together."" And he does. And then Ian McKellen as Gandalf looks at Frodo and smiles at him with such unbelievable love. It just blows off the screen and you could just see that Tolkien would have adored this portrayal of Gandalf. And it\'s interesting that Ian McKellen just doesn\'t take acting all that seriously and has been on a variety shows where he says, ""Well, somebody else writes the lines. I just stand where I\'m supposed to stand and read."" But he is a summit actor. And what he did with no words at all, just facial expressions just brought a whole Lord of the Rings feel of it in such an immediate, immediate way. I never forgot that.","I saw a movie that I enjoyed so much, I saw it three times in the last week. I first went to it alone. Then I went to it with my husband. Then I took my girlfriend to see it last night. The movie was about an event that was a fantasy and yet totally believable. The characters were sweet and lovely, and they made you want to know what happened to them, and you really cared about what happened. The music in the movie was so phenomenal and kept you on the edge of your seat. I also had acquired the tickets for a really good price. That made it more justifiable to see it so many times.

I intend to buy the movie when it becomes available. I may see it again soon with my son who wants to see it too and has not done so yet. The movie just makes me happy when I see it because of the joyfulness. The way they overcome their challenges with love and understanding is so lovely. It makes you want to persevere in the things you love as well.

The actors that portrayed the characters in the movie were remarkable. They were so realistic that you totally believed what was happening to them. They also were humorous and had many friends. Movies that include friendship and love are so rare nowadays, and that was refreshing. The fact that they were not white Americans was surprising but surprisingly a very good choice. It was sweet but not syrupy sweet.

It was a fantasy and yet a believable story. The story was just a remarkable way of showing perseverance and love with ordinary people. I hope that the movie academy of arts and sciences will consider it for some award. It was a brilliant concept and a wonderful story to impart to all ages. I've been telling everyone I know about the movie now.",2,334,353
"In high school, I wasn't one of the popular kids. Most people thought that I was kind of an eccentric weirdo. I'm not saying that they're wrong. I never quite fit in, but I did have a couple of friends who were outcasts just like I was. When I was a senior, my father bought me a used car. It was a green Duster. And I happened to be the first one in the class to have a car. So I drove that car to school. And when it was time for lunch, I would take my friends and drive around to get some food. We would park by the river and have a good time, and pretty much show off. And that was one of my happiest memories of high school. And I can still remember how proud I felt of that little Duster.","All my ""friends"" make fun of me for being bad at video games. Same with physical stuff. Got beat by every single one of them in races and arm wrestles. I get told I'm too skinny or all the sports I play are girly, and even with so many sports to my name, I still get destroyed in races.

I'm the laughingstock of my class. I feel like a joke, and my parents laugh at me too. I feel insecure about my body.

A girl next to me straight up said I look ugly because I have a bit of a mustache growing, and my jaw is too feminine. I feel mentally insecure, I'm not popular, I'm not strong, I'm bad at video games except for the ones none of my classmates play.

And I've been challenged by the same girl who made fun of my face to an arm wrestle tomorrow. She does several forms of martial arts.",1,165,185
"Okay. So, last year, I moved from Nashville to Boston, and made a big change in my life. And it was really challenging because I had a lot of friends in Nashville, a great community. I like to salsa dance and all of my friends came together before I left, and I threw a party. And they all came up with a really big gift basket for me. It had some of my favorite foods, things to bring with me to Boston. And one of the things that really was special, that they gave me, that made me really just warmed my heart. It made me feel so much gratitude and love, was they got me a gift certificate to have a dance lesson with an instructor here in Boston that has an amazing reputation that we've all wanted to train with. And now that I'm in Boston, I was able to take a class with her, and they gifted that to me. So it was a really huge gesture, and it makes me miss my friends so much. So much so, I'm going to visit them in a week, and hopefully dance and hang out with them again.","I attended an all-week event in another country. I didn't bring any friends, but that's perfectly fine. I got along with the other attendees extremely well, and I think I actually found 2 new friends. Everybody's so nice and inspired and driven by similar things as I am. My interests, taste in music, and spirituality are very niche, and while I do get to share some of it with the people close to me, I feel like they don't quite get me in that regard. But the people I met last week do, to an extent that nobody else has.

Everybody was being their weird self, shared their knowledge and experiences, and I also got to experience awesome things that I think will stick with me for a long time. Honestly, I haven't been this happy in a very long time. Being away from my home and the people close to me was intimidating, but when I was there, I felt in my heart that there was nothing to worry about. And there wasn't. Everything just kind of sorted itself out.

It was so freeing to be able to express myself in any and every way I felt like at the moment. And I got some very special things to take home with me to remind me of the great time I had and to bring with me when I return. I can't wait for that!",3,227,269
"Cool, yeah. So, I just got a new job and it's not close enough to where I can walk or take public transportation. So, I needed to buy a car. It was very nerve-wracking because I need a car soon, and I kind of had to make a decision pretty quickly. And the original car that I wanted to buy was not available, so that was disappointing. But they pointed me to a car that is used, but only has 116 miles on it. So, it's basically brand new, but it's used so it's not the original sticker price. I've never purchased a car that new, and I've never been able to afford a car that new. So, it's kind of scary and exciting at the same time. So, I get to have this new car. I've never had anything this fancy, but it's also a very large purchase and it's probably the largest purchase I've ever made in my life. And I know that my parents have never purchased a new car. I mean, none of my family has purchased a new car. They've never been able to afford it. So, to be in this position, it feels very strange but good but scary.","I am so happy with my new jobs, especially because one of the jobs is at a thrift store I adore. I'm 3 months pregnant, and we've been struggling, so this is just a huge relief off my shoulders. I can pay off my credit. I can buy my baby stuff. I can repair the things I need for my car. I'm so relieved I could cry.

Things have been difficult, and this is what we need. Both jobs have also known and congratulated my pregnancy and told me after delivery I'll still have my jobs there!",4,247,113
"Do. So, about I don\'t know, in 2013, I ran a five-mile race to raise money for cancer research. And afterwards, I went to a local place to eat that I hadn\'t been to before, and I decided to order the soup called Senkoco, and I didn\'t know what it was. But it sounded good, and it had chicken in it, so I ordered it. And when I got it and I took the first spoonful, I was immediately transported to my childhood. I realized that Sankulta was the name of the soup that my grandmother used to make for me growing up. And when she would cook, I would get so hungry. I could just smell the soup—it smells so good, so savory. And I would go to my grandmother, and I would beg her, ""Grandma, grandma is the soup ready?"" It was never ready, like it was, it always took a long time. And so at some point, she would say, ""Okay,"" and she would take a coffee mug and she would scoop up some of the broth, and she would let me sip on the broth and... it\'s probably one of my favorite things to eat. I still don\'t know how to cook it myself, but Senkoco is something that just brings me back to being with her and her love and caring. So that\'s my story.","My daughter and I took a trip to California. She read online about the train going down to California. It was highly romanticized, but it did look nice. We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery. It surprised me that the food was so good.

However, one of the really surprising things was the people we met. When they seat you at dinner, they put you with strangers, so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story. The stories were so interesting, and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them. In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once. It was really amazing. One person was nearly 94, but he appeared to be in his seventies. One couple was from the Philippines. One man was laid off and took a low-end job, and he admitted that his parents were supporting him.

There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and I kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story. Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story. We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures, and it became very raw and personal.

Previous to this trip, my daughter and I had not been very close. This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close. But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me. What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband. It was so surprising because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy.

Yet through the stories of strangers, I feel closer and more focused than ever. When she was little, we were so close. However, as she became a teenager, we have a more strained relationship. But after this trip, we are as close as ever.",1,271,400
"Week. So, I performed this weekend at the salsa Congress, and it reminded me of when I performed as a child. I took tap lessons for eight years, and there was one particular incident that was really scary and embarrassing. I was performing with two other girls. I was in the center, and I had one to my left and one to my right. Ashley was to my right, and Michelle was to my left. And part of our routine was to tap dance while jump roping. And we were wearing these leotard costumes with fringe skirts. And as we were performing, jump roping and tap dancing at the same time, Michelle's jump rope got caught in the back of the fringe of her costume, and I was in a high school auditorium, packed, completely packed house. And she ran off stage, and the crowd started to laugh. And Ashley and I kept dancing like we didn't stop. And while we were dancing, I looked over to my left off stage, and I could see one of the stage moms ripping out the fringe from the jump rope from Michelle's costume. And I could see that she was trying to push Michelle back onto stage, and Michelle was resisting all the while still doing my routine. The crowd's like giggling. And then the woman, the stage mom, successfully, literally shoved Michelle back onto the stage, and we had to finish the routine, and she rallied and caught back up. But it was kind of scary and I hadn't performed again in front of a crowd that large until this weekend, which was scary, but also exciting. So I feel like I kind of went through one of the worst experiences already, so I knew that this could only be better. And I was also supported by another 20 team members, so that made it really fun and helped kind of make me feel a little more protected. The safety in numbers type of thing. So, that's my story.","I went to a jiu-jitsu club night, and the guy teaching was a blue belt. I think I was a purple belt at the time. And, well, I kicked his butt royally. He's like, ""well, you need to start teaching over here."" So I took that over and just kept rolling with it.

And at first, it was just to stay in shape, keeping all my skills good. And then I kept it up, kept it up, and when I ended up deciding, ""hey, this is what I wanna do,"" it wasn't like a really quick decision. It took several years for it to culminate into something that was feasible.

We call it MAT therapy. It's very therapeutic because you're in the moment. You're only worried about the moment 'cause this guy's trying to choke you. He's trying to throw you. MAT therapy and kinetic problem-solving.

I'm in this bad spot, getting comfortable in bad spots. In my mind, I'm going, ""hey, this is no problem. I got this ginormous dude trying to squish me."" So if I can breathe here, man, you can breathe anywhere.",2,388,237
"So, I think I've mentioned that I have a cat. His name is Zoro. I adopted him when my other cat was about ten years old. Sadly, my other cat passed away a couple of years ago. I had him for 15 years and he was just super, like the best cat ever. And we were super close, definitely bonded. But when I adopted Zoro, he was only five months old and a couple of weeks in, my ex-husband, he got home before I did from grad school and his brother had come over and he was careless, and Zoro slipped out of the front door. He must have been extremely careless because the doorway is very narrow, so you really have to not be paying attention to have something like Zoro just slip by you. And I came home and I was terrified. He was only five months old. I was living in Florida and my apartment was adjacent to a nature conservation area. And in Florida, there are a lot of dangerous animals that would be predators to Zoro. Gators, alligators, venomous snakes, even hawks. He was small enough for him to be prey for a hawk, and that was all just feet away from my door. So I was really scared and I looked on the Internet. I looked at all the advice that people gave. I was searching everywhere. I stayed up all night. He didn't come to the door. And the next day, I finally got enough courage and was exhausted. I put on my rain boots, I tucked in my pants and put on a sweatshirt and a bandana over my face, and I went into the nature conservation area to find Zoro. It had been about 18 hours since he had disappeared and I happened to get close enough to the bush that he was hiding under for him to feel safe enough to meow. And I found him. But it was terrifying. And I did run into a gator at one point. Thankfully, I backed away slowly and the gator didn't present any aggressive behavior towards me, but it was scary. I was really worried. But I found him and Zoro is with me today, so I'm very glad that it worked out.","I was driving home and I noticed an old dog trying to cross the road. The dog was clearly old by the way it moved, and it was not even wearing a collar. I got worried about its safety, so I jumped out and got a collar and leash I had in my trunk. The dog seemed friendly enough, but they were clearly scared of me and I didn't want to put it in more danger, so I kind of shepherded it towards the side of the road. 

From there, I was able to approach the dog and get close enough to put a collar and leash on it. The dog had no collar or tags, and it was slightly past 9:30 at night. Thankfully, my house was close by, so I walked the dog into my garage and gave it some dog treats and water as it looked exhausted. This gave me some time to figure out what I would do next. 

I ended up making a big sign that I could post on the street corner nearby, thinking that its owners would be out looking for it. After the dog was refreshed a bit from some food and water, I got a new idea. Since I couldn't call animal control at that time of night, I was left with a few options. Keep the dog for the night and call for it to be picked up in the morning, or put the leash back on the dog and see if it would try to walk its way home. 

I chose the latter, so off we went in the dark, following the road until we got a few blocks away from where I lived. At this point, the dog was trying to turn off of the road into some very dark paths, and I was hesitant to go off the beaten path with my new friend. 

At this point, a car turned onto the street and pulled into its driveway. I thought it would be a good chance to ask a neighbor if they had a clue whose dog this was. As luck turns out, they knew the dog and pointed me to the home where its family is. Other than an awkward door knocking situation late at night, everything went well, and I was able to reunite the dog with its family.",4,433,434
"There was one time when he goes, I can't remember which one of my birthdays it was, but my mom had set it up to be at a Nathan's Hot Dog, and they had like an arcade. And everyone got tokens. And they were able to play all these games to win tickets that they could then pick prizes from. And two girls that lived down the street for me, they were sisters. They lived in a basement apartment. They had a single mom, no dad. And they couldn't afford to get me a present for my birthday. But they still came to the party. Totally fine. My mom didn't care. And they both played the arcade games to win as many tickets as possible, so that they could take the tickets and use them for a prize to give me as a gift for my birthday. And that was just something really, their selflessness to want to get me a gift on my birthday when they could have easily just taken those tickets and used them for themselves was really touching.","I was part of a military family. We moved a lot. I went to ten schools before I got out of high school. My family and the military community around us were part of my life. And also the Catholic church. 

At that time, for girls, the idea was if you weren't just gonna be a mom and a mother, there were really very few things you could do. You could be a nurse. You could be a teacher. And in my background, you could be a nun. I very quickly decided I wasn't gonna be a nun. 

I was 17. I'm just looking at the next four years. When I became involved in the Young Lawyers here in Denver, I certainly did not think that 28 years later I would become the president of the ABA. 

If you have passion for something, there's not such a thing as a 40-hour work week. I don't think I've ever done a 40-hour work week. Because I have so much fun doing what I do, it's just part of my life.",3,205,211
"Cool. I don't have a story about work, but I do have a story about the trip I took last week. I took a very short trip to Nashville to see my sister and to meet my new nephew. He's six months old. And when I lost my job in January, he was born at the end of February and I wasn't able to see him for this whole time he's been alive. And it's been really hard. I wanted to see him right away and to hold him. And without a job, I really couldn't plan a trip to go see him. So as soon as I was hired, I immediately bought a plane ticket so I could go see him. And it was so satisfying to hold him for the first time. And I facetimed with him and read him books. When she was still pregnant, I would read over the phone to him. And we basically, as soon as I saw him, it's like we were old friends. And I just got to hold him and play with him. And it was the best feeling.","I love animals. When I was growing up, my mom had a black Labrador called Nicky. And after Nicky passed away, it was a couple years later that we got a miniature poodle called Mocha. So from a young age, up until now, I've always been around animals, and dogs specifically.

I was a volunteer at the City Humane Society for a year and a half, where I pretty much just got to learn about the process of the shelter, kind of what the environment is like. And I ended up falling in love with all the people here and just the whole environment and the animals.

I wouldn't have known how much I enjoyed working with the animals until I actually did it. I've gone 20 something years not living for myself, always kind of feeling that I had to please someone else. At the end of the day, it's gonna be your life, and you're gonna be the one that looks back on it.",4,217,192
"A very good week at work. I did get some really kind of sad news. My uncle has lung cancer and he's in the hospital. He's been fighting it for a long time now, and he's just, like, not doing well. I'm not exactly sure what his status is. And my other uncle passed away of lung cancer, and his wife, my aunt, also passed away due to complications from smoking. And I'm really kind of scared.","The event that I remember the most is the death of my uncle, whom I was very close to. He got very sick with pneumonia and went to the hospital. When he was in the hospital, they found two spots on his lung. When he was first admitted to the hospital, he was spitting up some blood, but everyone thought it was because of the pneumonia. 

While he was at the hospital, the bleeding got much worse. He started spitting up so much blood that the white wash rags at the hospital were completely red. We knew that he had one spot on his lung that the doctors were following, but the second spot came as a surprise. He was never officially diagnosed with lung cancer, but we know that is what he had. 

The bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breathe at all, and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go. He never wanted to be put on life support, so the family just stayed by his side as all the machines were turned off and he drew his last breath. 

I was devastated having to watch someone that was so strong and loved life so much take his last breath. My uncle was my last living relative other than cousins. He was our family elder. I grew up with him and my aunt being just right down the road from me for over 30 years. 

Life goes on, but it certainly will be a lot sadder without him.",4,95,299
"Yeah. So this is the beginning of the school year, and I've seen a lot of people moving into their dorms and apartments. And it really got me thinking about when I first went to College, when I was moving into the dorm. How excited my parents were for me and scared. And I was both excited and scared, moving away from home and my parents, and knowing that I'd probably get really homesick. Watching all those kids moving in really made me think about how that felt for me. And it was really important for me, there was a lot of pressure for me to do well in College because my dad came here from a developing country and wasn't able to get an education past second grade. And I was the first person in my family to go to College, and to make it that far. So I had a lot of emotions, definitely some anxiety, some stress about the pressure of performing and doing well. But also the excitement, and kind of the normal fear that you get doing something you've never done before and not having parents who had never experienced College like that before. I didn't really have anyone to go to, to understand what that meant, like what to expect. So watching those kids just brought me back to that moment.","My passion was always to find a way to make a difference. But it wasn't until later in life that I really understood how to channel that passion. Right out of high school, I was being recruited to play football at Pittsburgh College, and the first day of class, I didn't go. Because I couldn't figure out how I was gonna get from where I live to Pittsburgh College, which was at least 45 minutes away. There was nobody around me to really help me understand the value of what that university could provide me. So I just turned it down.

I didn't understand where I was going or how I was gonna get there. But I went, walked into the doors of a community college, and then the community college pulled me in. Now, I have the privilege of serving as the chancellor for the California Community Colleges. So I have the pleasure of representing more than 2.1 million students to have the opportunity to finish a quality college credential and get into a job or to transfer and something that gives them an opportunity to really achieve what they wanna achieve.

But that's what it did for me, and that's given me the opportunity to really fulfill my passion and take it from there.",3,255,244
"So, I recently finished at work for a local museum. It's using techniques and technology that I haven't used before, which is exciting for me. So, it was a bit of a challenge to get it done in the month's time that I had to finish it. And, a few days ago, it was really nice to hear feedback about the work. Lots of people interacted with it, and friends came and saw it. All very good. It's a few days later now, and I have this lingering feeling of a bit of a letdown emotionally. Afterwards, it just feels like a lot of effort and, exactly, but there's a bit of an anticlimactic post-called postpartum kind of feeling after creating a network.","I got a part-time job at the brewery. I was working on the bottling line, and then our CEO needed help in doing office work, and I had experience doing office work, so I started doing that. It wasn't like a big career vision. It was just like someone asked, someone needed help, I could help her. So you can imagine making the transition from philosophy to finance.

Then I was Chief Operations Officer, and now I'm Sustainability Director. So all of those junctures have been a ""What am I doing? Is this what I wanna be doing with my life?"" 

Career doesn't have to be the fullness of your identity. And I think sometimes we expect it to fulfill a lot. Sometimes the stress is necessary for growth, but you also need that time for recovery and ease because that's when you sort of integrate your gains. And you can't always be sprinting and you can't always be coasting.",4,146,188
"Well, Debby, my story is about the snake skin I found in my basement that freaked me out. I'm now afraid to go back into the basement. What do I do?","It's been months. The last time I remember having my jeans is around Easter time, and then they just dropped off the grid. My first fear was they had been swallowed by the washing machine and were now in the sock afterlife. But more realistically, I thought they'd been stolen by my sister. We both have similar light blue jeans. She got her pair first when she was at university, so I didn't know she had them when I bought a similar pair.

We've been dealing with having the same jeans that keep coming out of the wash for a couple of years. Just after Easter, my pair went missing. I mentioned to my sister if she'd accidentally taken my jeans from the wash. She said she hadn't and showed me the pair that she had in her wardrobe.

I have other pairs of jeans, so I wasn't actively looking for it out of necessity, and I was stressed with my exams so didn't think about it so much. And now it's been a long time since I've thought about those jeans. Until I was collecting my laundry and found a pair of light blue jeans and remembered my old jeans. So I took them into my sister's room thinking I'll find them in her wardrobe. I was pretty sure the pair I was holding were her pair, not mine, though.

And there she was, sitting at her desk, wearing a pair of light blue jeans. We both just laughed. And she said that she had been thinking the laundry was being washed and dried quite quickly.

I am going to do some sort of embroidery on mine so this does not happen again. But I have my jeans back and I am happy!",3,37,335
"Wow, it was a beautiful evening and there were thousands of small swallows flying in the sky overhead. The sky was turning red and purple because it was sunset. It was absolutely beautiful, very peaceful.","My wife and I went on a small, last-minute vacation to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. It was in April of this year. It was a very memorable trip for me. I love spending time with my wife, and when we can get away at the last minute, that just makes it that much more special.

Gatlinburg is where we spent our honeymoon, and it has special significance to us. This time was special because we just bonded so much more than we usually do. We got to do more things because the weather was warmer this time around. We got to stay close to downtown, so we took a lot of walks together to a lot of different places.

The most memorable part was sitting on a balcony at a restaurant overlooking the main road that goes through town. We spent hours there just talking and people-watching. I still think about that afternoon and how much fun we had together just being together and not really doing anything at all.

Besides that day, we had a couple of great meals at some neat places. We also went to try a new place out that was really bad, and yet we still made the most of it.

Overall, that trip was one of my most favorite times of my life. It was because I spent it with my favorite person I've ever met. We still talk about how we can't wait to go back, but I don't think any trip will compare to that one.",3,40,281
"This story may be repetitive, but we had a little issue with the setup of the computer. Here, it didn't take the whole story, so I'll start again. So, I wanted to talk about my little city garden. I have been replacing a lot of plants that were in my garden with native pollinator-friendly plants. It has been a lot of work, but I believe it's paying off. I have been having butterflies in the garden - Monarch butterflies and Swallowtail butterflies. It has been a joy to see that the work has paid off because in the city, we need more green, we need more butterflies.","I'm the founder and executive director of this company where we design and build homes and commercial buildings that are highly sustainable, that exemplify my personal interest and concern for the state of the environment. I kind of just stumbled into it. I was in an environmental science program at the University of New Hampshire. And then, I stumbled across this book about earthships. And it was these people who were building homes literally out of all recycled materials, basically out of trash.

The principles behind it were the things that sort of inspired me. I decided to go out and get my own contractor's license and eventually built a small company. The thing that I really love about what I do is sort of creating something out of nothing. If you feel happiness on a day-to-day basis, you're succeeding in life.",3,124,158
"Here's my story today. And maybe it's more a reflection than a story, but just wanted to talk to you about my son's 40th birthday. It crept up on me, and that was interesting. He lives in another state. Now he's married. He has a child, and we do not have a day-to-day communication relationship. So he's very busy. So we catch each other when we can. Birthdays always make me reminisce about them growing up, both my sons. But this one was my younger son. So different. You think about a day that we were born, when you drop them off at kindergarten, their first day, first grade, and on to dropping them off at college and all that, and then their wedding. It's a lot of emotions during the day when they have their birthday, it always seems to happen to me. But now he's 40, and he has his own life, his own family. And our conversations are so different now. It's no longer the parent-child conversation. It's two adults talking. He told me all about how his house is coming along. He's doing a lot of renovations. He has a new job and wanted to talk about his daughter, who was starting second grade next week. So it was all very pleasant. But it's so different. It's just how life evolves over the years, from parent child to a different kind of relationship. And it is a little bit like the tables are turning. So a lot of memories in this city, a lot of memories. But that was today. And it always happens during their birthdays. So that's my story today.","My husband and I celebrated our third wedding anniversary. It is emotional for me because we've been together for eleven years, so celebrating an anniversary with someone I love so much makes me happy. A lot of people don't last in relationships, and to have a long-lasting relationship and a great one makes me very happy. 

My husband surprised me on our anniversary by taking me to the resort where we got married. It was a very special seafood dinner buffet. It was fancy, and when we go out to eat, we usually don't eat out at places so fancy, so it was very special. 

I have cherished the time I spent with my husband. We have gone on lots of fun trips together. We have moved cross country twice. My relationship is a very memorable part of my life. It feels very special to get to spend my life with someone. 

The most memorable part of this year as well is that my English Bulldog celebrated one year of not having aspiration pneumonia. She was very sick a year ago and almost died. She is very important to me and my husband. She makes us both very happy and adds to the joy of our relationship.",3,332,230
"Hello. Hi, I belong to an organization of elderly retired people who take care of each other. When somebody is not feeling well, we can run errands, walk the dog, that kind of thing. But we're also branching out to a more social adventure so we can bring people outside and be social because it's a real problem among the elderly that they are too isolated.\n\nSo in the beginning of the summer, I started a bocce group. I think it originated in Italy, with throwing balls down the lane. People get competitive. It's interesting. It has not been easy to get people to join. People tend to be busy, I think. They're a little worried about going outside and doing a game with other people, but I think it's worth keep on pushing it.\n\nLast night we had a very nice group together. We actually had two teams and we played for about an hour. It was really nice. We laughed a lot. People got a little competitive, etcetera, and it was fun. Now my goal is to get more people to join because I think it's good for people to be outside, do a game, and have fun. So that is my goal for the next couple of weeks. I hope we can keep playing into the fall and that we get more people to join. We'll see what happens and we'll all have to come up with something different when the weather gets colder. But that's my story today.","In early July, I played in a golf tournament that was put on by a foundation that helps families deal with cancer. It isn't so much a research and looking to beat the disease as it is to help families lead some kind of a normal life and allows children to do things like attend camps and parents to have such things that are taken for granted like ""date nights"".

I played with three of my good friends who I have known since high school. One of my friends recently lost his dad to cancer. I was very close to his dad and remain close to his entire family. It was a very hard time that he went through as well as the rest of the family. Truthfully, I struggled with it as well as, although he had been fighting cancer for 20 years, the end came pretty quick.

At this tournament, there was one hole that is called the dedication hole. On this hole, every person is given a new golf ball where they write the name of someone who has been affected by cancer in your life. Without being prompted, all of us put down my friend's dad's name. It was at this point that my friend and I both became very emotional.

This is a tournament that both of us have played in for a number of years, but even so, I didn't foresee the level of emotions that we would have at this point. I think that this will be something that will stick with both of us for a long time. I saw his mother recently, and she mentioned that it really meant a lot to her son, and he had mentioned it a number of times to her and other family members how touched he was.

It will remain something that I will hold near and dear to my heart for a long time.",3,290,352
"Okay. I went to the movies yesterday, and it was sort of interesting. It was a movie called ""Jewels."" And it\'s about an elderly man who has started to get memory issues. But one night he was asleep, and a small spaceship landed in his backyard. Sounds silly, but it was a real sweet story. It ruined his garden, and an ex-movie found a little alien on his doorstep. Like an alien with big eyes, but it wouldn\'t talk. And he had to figure out what he could feed it. But he took it inside and then he called the authorities about what had happened, and nobody wanted to believe him. He talked to some friends; they didn\'t believe him. His daughter thought he was crazy, and she took him to a neurologist to get his memory checked. But two friends happened to come by to check on him and went into the alien. So the three of them started taking care of a little creature, and it was quite an interesting story. Quite sweet. But it sort of resonated with me because a couple of days ago, I was somewhere with some friends, and we did something; I can\'t even remember what. And I mentioned, thinking out loud, ""Oh, this is a good story for my robot."" And it looked at me sort of strange. And I said, ""Yeah, I\'m working with this robot study for the Media Lab at MIT."" And they just looked very puzzled, and they just changed the subject. It was really interesting selling this whole alien thing and really happened. I could relate to that. See what other notes that I have on it, but I just keep thinking that even things like a gbo robot could be just like the little alien, meaning something to elderly people that are alone and don\'t see a lot of people during the day. And it could create some kind of friendship. There\'s three older people really open up to each other and talked about their past. And they were telling everything to the alien, who basically just stared at them and he wouldn\'t talk, but it was the cutest story when the alien got their little spaceship working again and he wanted them to come with him to outer space. In the end, it didn\'t work, but it was cute. But it seems just like, how can people relate to other creatures that are not really people and yet it\'s sort of a beneficial social companionship. So those are my thoughts. And I think that\'s it for today.","I'm an Assistant Professor in Astronomy and I study the dynamic universe. So what I do is, with the beautiful telescopes here at Palomar Observatory, we have some robotic telescopes that are continuously making a movie of the night sky. So we image the sky over and over again, and we look for what changed. You might go out there and think the universe is the same old thing every time, but it's actually not. It's full of these little explosions, which last for a very short amount of time, so they're very energetic. It's like cosmic fireworks lighting up our sky. 

It was not at all clear that one day I would do a PhD. I grew up on a farm in India with 100 cows and fields of weeds and chickpeas. And I had left home when I was 15, and I was a girl in India in a small place. The entire community was up in arms. There were people like neighbors, relatives, you name it. People I haven't even seen before coming into the house and trying to talk my parents out of this crazy decision to send their daughter alone on this journey into the other end of the world to pursue something called Astronomy or whatever that was. The community was completely unsupportive. 

In my case, the best way to deal with it was to just let that fade away in the background and not engage with it directly, but focus on what is motivating me, on what is giving me joy and just let everything else just fade away in the background.",4,498,301
"So today, I was giving a swim lesson and I had a very difficult person to teach today who wasn't listening. And it made me very frustrated at that person. But overall, it made me have to go back and try something new and adapt to the situation. Although I was annoyed a little bit, but overall I did get $50, so it was worth it in the end.","About 5 months ago, I quit my good job up in Virginia, sold my home, and moved back down to Florida. It all started out 4 years ago when my uncle, who owns a couple of event planning companies, asked me to come work for him since his main company just received a huge contract from the federal government. I said yes right away and quit my job as an assistant manager at a hotel and left for Virginia to work for him. He offered to let me stay in his basement, which was just a really nice downstairs apartment. I was very grateful and stayed with him for a year until I saved enough money to get into my own place.

At first, I really enjoyed the job and put in my best effort. The two owners, my Uncle and his best friend, were very happy with my performance. I was given a 50% raise after only six months on the job. After a year, I was promoted and given another significant raise.

After being promoted, I was put under the supervision of a new boss. She was very good at her job, but unfortunately, she was not good with the people working under her. She would talk very badly behind our backs and would not think twice about throwing us under the bus if it would keep her from looking bad. I worked for her for a couple of years until finally, I and a few others had had enough.

I complained to my Uncle and his best friend, who was also my old supervisor. They did not believe that she was such a problem. My work ethic started to decline because I was very discouraged by it all. I started to not take things seriously and then began to spiral out of control to a certain extent. I was not the only one on the team with this issue.

Finally, I tried to quit several times but was guilted into staying on the job. Then, over the course of one week, I purposely did not show up for a few days until they were forced to fire me. It was a hard thing to deal with considering how my uncle, who I was very close to, looked out for me in several ways, and because of that, we became very close.

The fallout was not pleasant, and because of it all, the relationship between me and my uncle is now severely strained, and I will never work for him again.",4,79,471
"So, about two weeks ago, I went to do an open water swim, which I haven't done in four years. So over the summer, I did quite a bit of swimming and working out to make sure I was in shape for the event. And then I got there, and there were tons of people. It was a two-day thing. I swam on the second day, but overall, I successfully finished it, and I got second place in my age group. So, I got a medal to take home, which is pretty cool. But it's good to see that all the work I did paid off, and it was a super fun experience to do.","No one thinks about bobsledding as a kid, especially around here, sunny southern California. You see it on TV during the Olympics, and that's it. It's just not something that you think about doing at a young age.

When I came to UCLA, even by my fourth, fifth year, I was like, what am I gonna do? Track's almost over, I keep getting hurt throwing javelin, and it's just like, what next? That's when my coach encouraged me to try out for bobsledding. Never been in a sled before, never been on ice before, but you have to realize what can I do now that I'll not be able to do later on?

You can't go back and bobsled in ten years, you have to do it now. This is the only time you can do it. So I was like, I gotta go do this, I gotta try it now or else I'll never know. And that ultimately led to Korea for the Winter Olympic Games.

So for me, my goal has always been the same, to make the Olympics. I just didn't realize it would be in bobsledding, but here I am.",2,135,237
"So, about two years ago, I was in a pretty challenging course with optional homework. I took the option and didn't do any of those homework because it didn't affect my grade. But then, coming up to the exam, I thought I knew everything that I needed, and the exam was a wake-up call where I didn't do so well. And looking back at the optional homework problems, they were very similar. So, I learned from that just to do those problems which, in the end, helped me do better on the following exams. But that was probably the worst test I ever did because I wasn't very prepared.","I took an exam without studying for it because I thought I couldn't take it. Learned I could just minutes before it started, so I had to do it without going over the subjects. 

I thought I had done horrible. But I received the results today, and I managed to pass with the exact score I needed! 

At least all those sleepless nights studying weren't for nothing!",2,128,76
"So, yesterday it was my birthday. I turned 23. And we went out to sushi last night, which was very fun. And I got a free dinner. And I went out with my friend, Amy. And a group of her friends whom I wasn't super close with, but I got to know all of them over dinner. And it was a very fun experience.","What a day, August 8, 2019! It was my 45th birthday, and I thought it was going to be just like any other birthday I have had. But this day, my family and friends decided to throw me a surprise party. I was in total shock, never expected a surprise party.

It started off like a typical day, waking up and getting ready for work. I had plans to have dinner with my significant other that night. After work, I came home and got ready for dinner.

When we got to the restaurant, he provided them his name, and they said that they had a special table for us in the back. The back room was usually only used for special occasions. When we walked in through the hallway to the back room, it was full of my friends and family.

We had a nice dinner, and there was a DJ playing music, so we enjoyed a little dancing. I have such wonderful family and friends, and getting to enjoy my 45th birthday with them was fantastic. I can't imagine having a nicer birthday. We enjoyed good food, good music, and wonderful company.

After hours of enjoying ourselves, it was time to leave. I hated that the night had to end.",2,76,244
"So, over the last couple of days, I've been volunteering for International Orientation. It's for international students at MIT who have come from different countries. I met many new people, not used to interacting with so many people at once, but it was fine. All the new kids are very interesting to talk to and they have so many questions. I think I was able to help them with some of them. It's also great to get food from orientation because dealing with food over the summer hasn't been fun. But yeah, it reminds me of International Orientation last year when I was an incoming freshman. I was very terrified of talking to people because everything seemed like so much at once. But I made a lot of friends, and now lots of them are mentors too. And I hope we're able to show the kids a good time. Tomorrow is the last day of International Orientation, and after that all the other freshmen from the US will be here too, and soon school is going to start. I'm kind of excited for the next one.","Last month, I was part of an amazing charity event that blew my mind and made me feel like I was making a difference. I was told about this event about 3 months ago, and we formed dance groups in order to raise funds for children and families in Haiti. The host of the event was going to personally fly to Haiti to deliver items and school supplies to the families with her charity group and make a difference in her community.

I did not think much of the event as I have been in events before, but this event was life-changing. I met so many new people in our dance community with such loving and caring hearts. We all became one that day and supported and cheered each other on to do our best. Each dance group had something different to bring to the stage, and many genres were learned and appreciated. We all were amazed at the hard work and dedication that was brought to make the event such a huge success.

In the end, the event was able to raise a lot of funds for the children of Haiti, and many school supplies were donated for them to have a successful school year. It was a truly amazing event that I will never forget surrounded by even more amazing people.

In the end, it wasn't about the dance groups, the attendees, or who did the best. It was all about the kids and who we were raising money for. Doing good for your community as well as others in need really humbles you and makes you realize how much you have. It is very important to realize these things in life to really appreciate the life you have been given and what you can do to make it even better for others.

If I was given the opportunity to take part in another event like this, I would do it in a heartbeat. I'm sure the rest of my colleagues would agree as well.",3,212,365
"One of my hobbies is origami, and I'm going to tell you about how I started getting into it. I think that started when I was around 14 or 13. And one day, the idea of making a paper dragon popped into my head. I'm not sure where that came from, so I scoured the internet. I went on YouTube and tried to find a video of origami dragon instructions or a tutorial. I wanted a model that looked cool, and I wasn't really thinking about how difficult it would be to make.\n\nIn the end, I settled on some pretty complex models and tried to make them. Since I had never really done origami before, except for simple paper planes and unpapercrafts, it was very difficult. I'm talking about hundreds of folds, all made with great precision. So I tried over and over for a day, and then another one, and then it went to a week. I must have tried 20 or 30 times, each one taking hours. And then I couldn't go to finish. I even traveled a bit that week, and even during the journey, I was folding and folding and folding. I tried to fold that model so many times that at some point, I committed most of the folds to memory.\n\nAfter about a month of trying, I was finally able to finish making the model. It was very satisfying to have finally got it done. And that sparked my love for origami, and I went on to make many, many more models. And I still enjoy doing origami to this day. I also want to learn to design my own models and learn about the interesting math behind origami and research done in the field. But I think most of all, I just enjoy the process of folding and creating something with my hands. Once the model is finished, it feels like it's over, and I'm just looking for a new one to start working on.","I really love making people happy, and I love using power tools and stuff. So obviously, I was really happy when my flatmates asked me if I could drill some holes in their wall to fix a wardrobe that would otherwise fall over if the doors are open. They borrowed a drill, got some dowels and screws, and I got to screw around with some nice power tools. I feel honored that they trust me to do this. 

After the wardrobe was fixed to the wall, I went back to my little crafting table. All Christmas gifts this year will be handmade by me. I'm making a gift for a friend, and I spent some time on cutting, sanding, gluing, and painting this little thing, and today I pre-drew the outlines of the last bit I need to paint on both sides and finished painting one side. 

I can't wait for his reaction when I give it to him!",3,377,179
"Okay. So here\'s a story I heard when I was a kid, and I think it\'s from an old Buddhist tradition. But I really like the story, and I still think about it occasionally. It\'s pretty meaningful to me. So here we go.\n\nIn the forest next to a big Kingdom, there lived a huge herd of deer. Their leader was the King Deer, with magnificent horns and a golden glimmering coat. One look, and you could tell he was the King of the deer.\n\nThe deer had one problem. The King of the neighboring Kingdom would like to hunt, and he would hunt with his soldiers, courtiers, and ministers. They would slay tens of deers every day. And to put an end to this madness, the deer came up with this lottery system approved by the King. Every day, the deer would all pick a leaf at random. And the deer with the most holes on the leaf would be sent as a sacrifice to the King. This way, the King of the Kingdom would not hunt the deer.\n\nSo the system is put into effect, and for many days, weeks, months, and years, the deer would pick a leaf every day and one would be sent to die.\n\nOne of these days, the King Deer heard some noise and went to investigate. He saw a few other deer ganging up on one doe and bullying it. He asked them, ""Why are you doing this?"" And they said, ""Today, it is this doe\'s turn to be sacrificed to the humans, and she\'s refusing to go.""\n\nThe conscience of the King Deer stirred. Is this an unfortunate fate that has led them to this cruel system? One where, by mere bad luck, one is sent to die? However, the system is the same for every deer, and they can\'t show favor to one doe or another. So, he asked, ""Why do you refuse to go to the humans?""\n\nThe doe pleaded, ""Please let me live another week. You see, the doe is pregnant, and her child will be born soon. And she doesn\'t want it to enter the world only to die with her. She wants someone else to go that day instead.""\n\nThe King hears her, and he realizes that he cannot send this doe and her child to die. Two lives gone where only one should be. But he also knows that he can\'t send any other deer in their stead, for that would be unfair to them.\n\nSo the dear King realizes and chooses to go himself. He sacrifices himself. Once the King sees him, he realizes at once that this is the King of the deer, and he is shocked. And goes hunting no more in the forest.\n\nHe sees the fragility and the vulnerability. And he realizes that the King sacrificed himself to save the life of an unborn child. The human King realizes that he can\'t hunt the deer anymore and is moved by the sacrifice of the deer King. And the deer are now free to live again.\n\nI really like this story because it shows that mercy is very powerful. And sometimes, you do have the power to make someone\'s life better, to help them. And maybe it will not be as hard of a sacrifice as what the King of the deer did. But in our own small way, we can help.","Thanks to him, there will always be a piece of me missing. His job was to teach math, yet he decided religion should be taught first. Laughing in our faces as he told us how we were all worthless bags of flesh and deserved to burn forever. Along with our parents. Gleefully, joyfully. A class full of minors.

As someone who was never directly exposed to religion, it hit me. Hard. Have you ever felt true fear? I mean complete and utter hopelessness. Were you in so much fear that you beg any god out there to spare your mother and take you instead?

Now imagine the never-ending pain. The dread to the point of being sick, the constant torture, the OCD you develop, the suicidal thoughts that NEVER shut up. Being tortured by your own mind.

And him? He got a slap on the wrist just to exclaim weeks later that he would never force his religion on anyone. As if he didn't bring it up out of nowhere before. Laughing, laughing, so happy as he told us what was going to happen to everyone we loved.

Even today, I won't forget his laugh. His literal cackling as he paced around with joy. But I'm no longer the same. I used to be curious and asked all the big questions about the universe. Now? That part of me is dead and actively avoids it out of fear. There will always be a deep part of me that flinches when I see a cross or pass by a church.

The pain of having to fear for your parents' eternal misery. The obsession, the inability to think, the torture, the mental mind games. Even though it's been three years, I will never forget it. For eighteen months, I was in SO MUCH pain. It NEVER stopped. I didn't cope. I lost all motivation and became a shell.

I don't wish him any harm. I don't want revenge. But I wish he knew that what he did only ensured that I would never be truly able to relax in that religion. That there will always be a remnant of pain and fear. That I am not the same person, that the curiosity that fueled my childhood into the mysteries of the universe is killed. I hate that he could do this when he was supposed to be teaching math.",3,653,459
"So, I was having a conversation with a friend today about how art is a very essential thing for humans. It's somewhat like pure expression of human spirit. But unfortunately, we sort of tend to restrict human or performers of art to only the very best. The people who become painters are the best at painting, the people who are the musicians are the best at music, and so on. And Project Trooper, we talked about participatory music, where the audience is part of the music as well. And it's just a thing that people do, as opposed to being an exclusive stage for professional musicians. So my friend brought up this study, which I thought was really interesting. In an Indigenous community in Peru, music-making is highly participatory. And an ethnomusicologist conducted a study there once. So any male community member is welcome to perform with pipes or flutes with his community, and anyone is welcome to dance. So, one time when the author of the study was at one of these events, there were two folks from the community who performed with extremely out-of-tune flutes. However, it seemed like everyone was having fun. The author of the study, coming from a very different background from the West, was driven crazy by the out-of-tune flutes and tried to stand as far away from them as possible. But he was shocked that none of the other players felt any or gave any indication that anything was wrong, and no one discouraged their participation. And later, he had a conversation with another professional musician about how to tune, and even he said he cannot bring himself to point out that the flutes were out of tune. So, this is very different from the society that I'm used to, which is where only the best are expected to perform, and music is often a way for the most talented people to showcase their talent. But since art is willing to grow to the human experience, isn't it better for music to be participatory? And you should probably be more accepting of all kinds of skill levels taking part in art instead of just putting the best on a pedestal. On the flip side, I also think that there should be people pushing art to its boundaries. And of course, that can't be everyone. I just think, and my friend thinks too, that everyone should get a chance to participate in music, just like that community. And curve.","Initially, I did not want to be a teacher. But as I went through school, I realized by the time I was in high school that I needed to be a teacher. The reason that I needed to be a teacher was because I loved school a lot. I loved learning a lot. But I didn't have a teacher that I really liked.

I felt, at a young age, that if I had had that kind of experience where I felt connected to my school and connected to at least one teacher, I would've been an even better student and school would've been a better experience for me.

I felt that when it was time for me to become a teacher, my job was not to be your friend but for you to know as strict as I was, that I still cared about you, and I cared about your achievement, and I cared about you as a human being.

I've gotten to a place in my life where what is most important to me is to make a difference, no matter how small or how big, it's to make a difference.

Whatever you decide to do with your lives, it has to be something that becomes your life's work. It has to be your life's work. Because this world now is at a place where you can make money, you certainly can make money. And you can make a lot of money. But your life's work, a piece of it has to be able to help other people.",3,470,294
"I'm going to tell you about the time I moved when I was eight, maybe nine. I think it was in elementary school, and I think that's what got me into reading and learning. So I just started school, maybe finished first grade in the middle of second grade, so maybe I was only seven. We moved homes, so it was still in the same city, but I didn't know any of the kids in the department we were looking into. And all my friends in the neighborhood were no longer there. So eventually, I did make a few friends, but in the beginning, there was not really much to do outside because I didn't know anyone. So I was at home. We happened to have a bunch of books at home, or like random encyclopedia books. And I decided to start reading them. And they were fun, and I liked learning about things around the world. And since it wasn't through school or I wasn't being forced to do it, I just thought it was fun. And if I forgot stuff, it was okay. Unlike school where you have to remember everything or try. So it was just fun, and I just wanted to accumulate a bunch of knowledge. And it was fun to throw it out randomly. And I always obsessed over it. I really liked that. And so it got me into reading. And then eventually, I started reading stories and fiction and stuff too. I haven't been reading as much these days, but I still love learning things. That stuck with me. It also helped me at school, somehow surprisingly, because later in higher classes, I would come across the same things again that I'd already seen in encyclopedias before, just through browsing. And it made school much easier for me. Yeah, my teachers are always kind of surprised that I've read this in some random, obscure book somewhere. That feeling of just learning things for the fun of doing it and satisfaction in doing it is something that I really want to keep with me.","""You are so smart."" That phrase has been told to me since I was a kid. I felt special when I was told this, so I did everything I could to get that phrase told to me by my peers, parents, and teachers. I even got into college with a pretty big scholarship.

But now that I am in my second year of college, I am massively struggling as I now see that my crutches in the form of extra credit, the scheduling that was given to me, and caring teachers are gone. I stay up late, doing homework, studying, trying to remember the information that I understand but can't retain, but it's not enough to pass tests that were supposed to be easy.

I feel like I was never that smart, just lucky. The little voice in the back of my head is telling me that everything that I have built up over the years should just be burned down, that I don't deserve to be in college. I should just let myself flunk out and let my family, friends, and everyone see me as what I am, an idiot who got a bit of luck and doesn't deserve the praise she got over the years.",2,406,237
"So here's something I wrote about Doors, but it's really sort of a metaphor for irreversible things. There it goes. Imagine you're in the room, the kind of room which you never really think of leaving. There's a door, though. And in this otherwise perfect room, this door troubles you. You don't know what's on the other side? It might be paradise. It might be hell. It might be nicer than your room. It might be worse. It might bring you right back to where you are. Do you take the door? So the door turns out, it's just a doorway with one without one, you can always see the other side. And it looks like paradise. Since you can always return and everything will be exactly as it was before you left, you can choose to take the door. Just seems like an easy decision. I mean, if the paradise outside the window is an illusion, I can return and there's a safety net. And that's nice. So you could choose to take the door. Not much can go wrong. Okay. Now let's suppose the door was made of wood. So there's a door now, a real tangible one. You can't peek through. But you can still walk back if you take the door. You might enter paradise or you might rescind your house. You take the door. So out of ground this choice isn't much harder. Life in the room is nearly perfect, though, and would be at risk being thrust into hell for a chance of something better. I don't know. But in the end, you know you can always come back. So I take the door. Now suppose the door is made of glass. You can see the other side. And it's paradise. There's a lock, however, so if you leave the door, you will never return. All you have is the vision through the glass. So this is scary because it's permanent. And the glass lets you catch a glimpse of what's outside, but you can never really be sure until you go there. But you also don't need to leave immediately. I can stay in my perfect room for however long I want. And then take the door. Now, suppose the door is made of metal. You can't see through it and it will lock so you can only choose to exit and never return. Do take the door. Now this takes are much higher because you don't know what's beyond the door and you can never return, but you still have the option of waiting for long. You can spend your entire life in your perfect room and then take the door when you have nothing to live. But now imagine you have to do the whole thing again, with all these different doors, but you only have one night to decide whether you take the door at all if you do want, if you want to. It might be the best decision you ever make or the worst one. Maybe you never know what you missed. I can't decide whether I want to take the door in that one.","I grew up in Nigeria, but we came from a very entrepreneurial family. And that meant that people were doers. And I believe in life, that you actually have the capacity to do whatever it is you want to do. Nobody else is going to do it.

There are so many things you see in life that you feel like there's injustice. But often times you just relax and say, ""Somebody else is gonna do it."" Well, that somebody else is you. And you seem very controlled about your own life and very driven. So I'm wondering, was there a time when you were less sure about yourself?

Yes. Okay. Oh yeah. Tell me about that. Computer scientists know nothing ever works the first time, that's the beauty of it. It's a problem-solving thing, and so failure is built into the act of learning. You have to trip and trip and trip and trip.

And then, once you figure out all the ways you can trip, you finally learn how to walk. It's little baby steps to build that muscle of courage and confidence. Just take a deep breath and just tell your feet to move, and your feet will move.",4,623,238
"Blue. Today, I attended the first lecture of one of my classes this semester, which is quite fun. The class is about J.R.R. Tolkien, the famous author of The Lord of the Rings. He was also a great scholar of medieval literature, languages, philology, and stuff. He had conversations with friends like C.S. Lewis, who, at least in the beginning, was an atheist and didn\'t believe in the value of things like God and metaphysics. But he later changed. He later converted. But that\'s not what I want to talk about. Today, we read a part of a poem written by Tolkien, which wanted to explain why metaphysics are important, because C.S. Lewis was of the opinion that metaphysics are just beautifully crafted lies. They have no truth in them, and therefore, they\'re not worth anything. And Tolkien\'s response was to compose a long poem about why metaphysics are useful. But one part that particularly caught my attention was the beginning, where Tolkien describes this fictional character called Miso Metis, who doesn\'t believe in the value of metaphysics. He says the person looks at natural objects like trees and just labels them ""trees"" and walks across the Earth as though everything is determined mathematically. Atoms move as they\'re expected, and every outcome is predictable, as if the world is just code regimented in a way where destined atoms are each moment\'s flame. So, it\'s like a very lifeless worldview. And he contrasts this with a different one in which he believes in a God and has a belief that there\'s some purpose beyond our comprehension, and God who made everything in the world. And these are not merely just objects that work according to mathematical principles, but more than that. I think this struck me because, like the professor mentioned, MIT students tend to have this worldview. And I think he\'s right. I think many people tend to view the world, at least here, as deterministic, a bunch of things that have predictable outcomes, and they can try and optimize for plans within their control to take advantage of this nature of the world. And they treat life as sort of an optimization problem, trying to get the maximum or some sort of maximal outcome. I don\'t think all MIT students are like this. I think a large chunk of them aren\'t, but there\'s definitely some subset which does think like this. I disagree with that worldview. I agree with Tolkien, and it seems very cold and regimented because if you treat life like an optimization problem, you would miss many things like art, which, in some sense, is a completely useless expression of the human spirit. But somehow, we need it. We need it in our lives. Although maybe a lot of it would never have been created with a completely scientific and rational point of view of the world. I also think it might not be worth micro-optimizing things and that part of life is experiencing imperfections and decisions. But maybe that\'s just me. I\'m not sure.","In my family, nobody has a PhD except me. I was the first scientist. So nobody really could help me about science, engineering, or computer science.

The reality is that you will make mistakes. I made mistakes, and there is nothing bad with that.

If you go to grad school and after a year say, ""It's not for me,"" it's okay. There is nothing bad with that. It's an experience. You learn something. It helps you to be stronger.

Year after year, you will build your self-confidence about your decision. About what you want. About what you like.",4,591,123
"Two: So here are some of my thoughts on being boxed and also starting out. Two sort of different but similar things. So let's start with being boxed in. Being boxed means that everyone around you, or at least many people around you, have a certain preconception of how you act and what you'll do. And it's quite hard to change their perspective because it's not really in your control. But whenever you do something which is outside the box they put you in, it's jarring to them and they don't like it. They try to make you not do that and you stay in your box, which is kind of awful because that means it's hard to change. Because people would find it odd if you try to change and people also make wrong assumptions about you. And sometimes they don't tell you about it and it can affect things adversely for a really long time. Conversely, people also try to fit in a lot, having sort of idiosyncrasies or different characteristics. As we heard, I'm humans naturally seek some sense of belonging, I guess because they're social animals, and that leads into fitting in. And this leaves the suppressing parts which make each person unique. And that's a little sad, actually, I think. A friend pointed out that this also depends on what kind of social structure you grew up in. For example, if you grew up in a more collectivist society, like say somewhere in East Asia or India, like me from childhood, you're expected to behave in the normal way and there are many more rules about fitting in with everyone else. And as a result, you sort of double up less, I think you develop less idiosyncrasies. When you're older, there isn't really much to suppress because you already fit in just because of the way you've grown up. Of course, fitting in in one of those societies, coming from the outside with the only unique characteristics, will be much harder. Conversely, somewhere like the US, which is very individualistic, there's less of an expectation to fit in, but as a result, people develop their own unique behaviors. And some of these will be seen as extreme for people coming from more collective societies, and they would stand out. But standing out is seen as not a bad figure, which is great. I'm not sure if it's great but seems alright. So yeah, I've not had many experiences with standing out, at least that have affected me in a negative way. However, I do feel boxed in a lot. And once I started taking notice of when that's happening, I realized it happened nearly every day and definitely many times a week. And I'm not easily bothered by most things, but this is starting to get to me. And last week, I snapped at someone I perceived as boxing me, and I normally don't do that. And I still think why that bothers me so much. And I think the main reason is it prevents you from changing and doing things you find interesting just because it doesn't fit in your box. Even today, someone told me that when I told them about talking to you, they said they wouldn't have expected me to have done something like that. Basically, I'm not in their box. And I really don't like that. Not many things annoy me, but that is one thing that does.","I hate being female in this society. I hate body standards. I hate society for making me grow up comparing my body to everyone around me, seeing only one body type to look up to in media. I hate that body types go in and out of trend. I hate that skinny is an accessory.

I hate that I grew up with family monitoring my body in a way they didn't do for my brother. I hate how impressed everyone was when I lost my appetite for a year. I hate how much better I got treated once I lost weight. I hate that I wasn't even given the chance to accept my body before it started giving out.

I hate that it's easier to tell people about my medical history than it would be to tell them I gained 10 pounds. I hate how much it's all shaped me. I hate that no matter how hard I try, I can't reverse the harm.",3,677,183
"About. So. The story is about my friend who just is leaving Cambridge. And. Is traveling like a nomad, like he's going to Italy, and then he's meeting her family there. And then she will be like she doesn't know where is she going to keep traveling. And. I have been regretting not traveling this summer. So, yeah, I just feel like I just had a very busy summer. And I am regretting not traveling.","My daughter and I took a trip to California. She read online about the train going down to California. It was highly romanticized but it did look nice. We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery. It surprised me that the food was so good.

However, one of the really surprising things was the people we met. When they seat you at dinner, they put you with strangers, so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story. The stories were so interesting, and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them. In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once. It was really amazing. One person was nearly 94 but he appeared to be in his seventies. One couple was from the Philippines. One man was laid off and took a low-end job, and he admitted that his parents were supporting him.

There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and I kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story. Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story. We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures, and it became very raw and personal.

Previous to this trip, my daughter and I had been not very close. This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close. But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me. What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband. It was so surprising because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy.

Yet through the stories of strangers, I feel closer and more focused than ever. When she was little, we were so close. However, as she became a teenager, we have a more strained relationship. But after this trip, we are as close as ever.",3,92,398
"One, so I think it is just like one of the things. That. What was that? Like? I was talking to some other girl, and she was like, she was getting concerned about it. That, why do you talk? And then I told her something that happened a day before, and she was like, ""Why didn\'t you tell me yesterday?"" And at the time it happened. So she just said like whatever has happened, like she wants to know at that moment and that second. But given that everyone is busy, if I tell her anything beyond a day, she feels like, okay, that is something you\'re telling. I think she misses acknowledging the fact that she got to know from me, and she delves into the part that, ""oh, I missed something knowing yesterday."" And then I am hiding other things as well, and she feels that she\'s not getting to know the entire thing.","She moved across the country, and for the last year, we've remained really close, and she would always be the first person I'd want to talk to, and vice versa. But lately, there's been a shift in our relationship, and I just don't feel like she actually cares or is interested in me as a person anymore.

We used to talk all day, every day about anything, and now she only engages in conversation if it's for advice or for her to rant about something that's bothering her. I try to engage in more light-hearted conversations, and she immediately switches the topic to be about her. And she always says she has my back, and I can tell her anything, but as of lately, I don't feel comfortable approaching her with anything that's bothering me because she either ignores me or switches the conversation.

The thing that really bothered me and I think started the shift was when I was going through a rough time and really needed a friend to talk to. I tried telling her about some things that were bothering me, and she said it wasn't healthy for me to be so negative and that I should see a specialist or doctor - so it's okay for her to complain to me daily about her issues but tells me I should find a specialist? That rubbed me the wrong way, especially from someone I've built a lot of trust with.

I'm just feeling like we're drifting apart, and I can't keep putting in the effort for a one-sided friendship. I'm afraid that will just be the end of the friendship.",1,189,313
"So my story is about my feelings that got activated about the feelings of jealousy that got activated when I got to know that a friend of mine, who is younger to me, got a job. And I just feel that I am running behind in my life, certain aspects. And there are people, and people around me, who are like having the same level of achievement at a younger age. So I just feel like jealousy and not good, and that I think stems from my limitation somewhere.","Dealing with racist issues in Texas, in the south, in the 80s really impacted my academic self-esteem. Once I got past that, I had a teacher who encouraged me, who basically did a very simple thing. He told me that you define you. If you define yourself, it's got to be up to you. That completely changed my life at the age of ten.

When you go through a period of your life where you don't believe in yourself very much, and then the light comes on and all of a sudden you believe that, ""Wow, I can do anything I set my mind to. If only I knew what I wanted to set my mind to.""

I have a big issue with prioritizing because there's a lot that I want to do right now. And so when you try to do everything, that's when you get frustrated.",2,99,172
"Done. So, I am moving from my current location to where my girlfriend lives. And my plan was to send the boxes of my stuff to her place, that is her house. And she initially mentioned that ""you really need to send those multiple boxes"". Then we kind of figured it out. And the last time we talked about it, it was more humorous, like ""oh, really? Where are you sending those boxes?"". ""Oh, my address."" ""Okay."" And this time yesterday, it was again that sense of ""thing"" where she doesn\'t want me to send those boxes. And she said, ""wasn\'t it just one box? Are you sending multiple boxes to my house?"". And it makes me feel that I am dependent on her for shipping those boxes and I am asking her for a favor. And it makes me feel like it just pushes my self-respect in that sense. And I don\'t really feel good about it. And I have been angry all night and all day.","I made my girlfriend angry a few days ago. She ended up sending me a torrent of verbally abusive messages. Not wanting to deal with this treatment so late in the night, I stopped reading them. The next morning, they sent a message apologizing for their behavior. I took some time to take care of myself and accepted her apology a few hours later. 

Our conflict seemed far from over, but it had only just begun. I was not in a great mood after the night before. As one could expect, I was just the least bit withdrawn and didn't want to talk to them much. This caused her to get paranoid, defensive and triggered another torrent of angry, abusive behavior from her. 

What ensued was a fight where she said she would break up with me. Eventually, I would have enough and called her out on her behavior. This only caused her to get more angry. She told me I was like an abusive parent. The next couple of hours were little more than narcissistic projection on her part. I was dumbfounded by her blatantly abusive and manipulative behavior. 

In the end, she told me she wouldn't actually leave, but that she needed to 'take me down to my knees.' In her mind, she was knocking me off my high horse. Since then, I have slowly grown to lose my feelings towards her. I will likely break up with her the next time this happens.",3,206,279
"So, I was trying to send my stuff as I\'m moving to my girlfriend\'s house, but my girlfriend objected to that, saying that her parents don\'t like me sending my stuff to her house. And if she was not clearly telling me why because she was like, ""I\'ll be more hurt if I listen to that point."" And now I am wondering why her parents talk about something hurtful to me. I have spent time with them and I thought it was all good. But I am having very broad questions on this. So guide me too.","I made my girlfriend angry a few days ago.

"One, my story is about my nephew. I had a very long conversation with him today. He is young right now. He's just starting his college. And he has been, like, decently a good student. Like in the initial school days, he was not that great, but he actually picked himself up and got good marks. But now, as I've been talking to him, I feel that he's targeting his aim too low. And he's just happy with anything. And he doesn't have a lot of cognitive sense to himself. And I get very angry at things when I hear that. These are so easy. Why don't people think about it? And I get irritated and I shout at him. And then I feel that I'm not treating him well. And I might not be a good uncle to him.","As a child, my best friend would quarrel with me if she saw that I bought myself the same thing as her. To be honest, I don't understand her anger. We live in a small town and go to the same shops.

And why can't I like the blouse she liked? I always told my friend: If you don't want someone to wear the same things as yours, customize it. For example, I will not express dissatisfaction if I see a girl in the same clothes as me.",1,169,102
"Yeah, I\'ve been reaching out to more people and seeing if I can talk to more people in this New York City and get to know more people around here. I had a dinner with a friend last week, which was really nice. It was really good to have common friends and then catch up. We had Korean food, which was really nice. And I think she is Chinese. I don\'t think she ever had Korean food, I don\'t know. It was very new for her, so it was really nice just to explore something new together. She\'s a master student, so she\'s still studying. That was interesting to hear what she\'s been doing and what? Yeah, I just graduated so I could see, I could see whatever she was going through, like how I was also going through the same things and how difficult it is to start studying again, and then be in this new space where you\'re supposed to perform so much, but then you\'re also trying to get somewhere. But it\'s also really confusing and scary. So I could empathize with that, I think. But then, yeah, it was interesting. I did feel like not heard in that whole conversation. It was very one way, she didn\'t ask a lot about me, which is fine. But it was like a network dinner, and not like ""Oh, friend"" kind of thing, which is also fine. I think not every person you meet is going to be your friend, but it was like a new thing to try, which was nice.","I was dating this woman who was really adventurous and really wanted to go to Japan, and I didn't really know what else to do, and I was like, ""Sure."" I happened to luck into a job working for an English language newspaper there, writing about environmental issues, which was like the coolest job I never deserved.

They were looking for somebody who spoke Japanese. I managed to convince them I could get it done without speaking Japanese, and somehow they fell for it. And it was a great job. I got to travel all over Asia.

That was profound for me as a person because I'd never really been in a place where I was different from everyone else. You're a different person once you've spent some time abroad and learned from other people.

Once you've changed your perspective to understand that there's more than one way to think about the world, you can't ever really change back.",2,310,184
"Like, I think one story or just like an interesting thing which I observed, I have is, it\'s all important to have representation at work or at the places that you are at because that sort of makes different people feel comfortable and more accepted, and more accepted, that\'s the word. For example, if I\'m in a different country or a different state, which I don\'t know anything about, and if I\'m walking there, if I\'m around people who have different experiences in life, I feel it takes a lot of time to just get comfortable around them, to feel more confident about yourself, to know and see how you can pick one and survive, but also thrive there. It takes a lot of time and it\'s helpful just to be aware of that and not be like ""Oh, there\'s something wrong with you,"" but they\'re just like a different environment and the people are different. Everyone\'s trying.","Nineteen years ago, I started working for SLUG Magazine. The previous owner of SLUG heard about me and called me up and asked me to shoot a cover. That's how I first became a staff member of SLUG. From that point forward, I became a managing editor, and then two years later, I had the opportunity to take over the magazine, and that's when I officially became editor and then publisher.

I've always felt different from my family and from being part of the peer group I grew up in, I just always didn't quite connect. But I kind of learned to appreciate Salt Lake City for what it is, and the work here that we could do to find others that feel that way. Where they may not feel that way at home, or at school, or in a lot of other environments.

But here in SLUG Magazine, we can really appreciate them for being different. I really love doing what I do and hearing these stories from these individuals that come up to you and say hey, I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for my experience with SLUG Magazine, hearing that feedback and that validation from other individuals about how we've affected their lives in a positive way, that's priceless.",1,188,246
"Yesterday, yesterday, we went to another friend's house. There were a lot of people around, 20 to 30 people from our church. And we brought Samba. We played volleyball and Samba. Other dogs and we also had a lot of fun there.","I recently went on vacation with my family. We went to Point Magu in Malibu to go camping for three days. When we first arrived, we set up our tent and got our food ready for cooking. Once our tent was set up, we laid out our sleeping bags. We then started cooking our lunch for the day. We started our firepit and prepped our food. I then cooked hot dogs and french fries for my family. We ate on the picnic table that was at our campsite. The food was delicious, and then we got ready to go to the beach.

We walked down to the beach and frolicked in the waves. We then sat on the sand and soaked up the sun. After the beach, we walked back to our campsite and started to prep for dinner. We had hamburgers and salad for dinner and made s'mores for dessert. We loved cooking over the firepit because we were connected with the outside world.

We went to sleep to the sounds of nature. When we woke up, we were completely refreshed and recharged.",3,51,205
"Hello. The story I'd like to tell is about my desire to have my foot heal faster than it is. The doctor told me that it would take two months for me to be able to be weight bearing again on my foot that had surgery. However, I assumed that I would heal faster and that it wouldn't be as painful as it was, the recovery that is.\n\nWell, six weeks in, the doctor said things were coming along smoothly and that I could start doing some weight bearing and start physical therapy. So, that was a week ago yesterday. Things are getting better, but I'm not progressing as quickly as I would like. I guess that's what we all think we're going to do something faster, better, or whatever than the average.","I was treated for cancer this year, and since September 18th I've had a tube in my chest for chemo and other meds. I finally got it out earlier this month, and I just had my first shower where I didn't need to worry about it! Every shower between Sept 18th and now was as quick as humanly possible, a bag needed to be taped on my chest to keep water out, and I had limited mobility because of the tape.

But this shower was legit. It was warm, and free, and I feel so good. I still gotta get the stitches out, but that's whatever.

I'm so glad to have a bit more of my independence back, and to have some stress and worry taken away. I'm so happy and clean!",1,152,154
"One experience I'd like to share is that of traveling as a lone person. On one trip to Spain, I lived there for several months without knowing anyone, but I had contacts, so I wasn't alone. And one morning, on my way someplace, it was a Sunday morning, and as I was walking down the street, I learned something about the Spanish culture in the area that I was in. That staying out late, and perhaps I mean by late, I mean to dawn beyond the madrugada, was a common experience that people didn't feel badly about, especially when they had overexcesses in drinking and were sleeping on the street. So, I was walking down this street on a sidewalk in Avocado and I started seeing lots of people sleeping, relying on the sidewalk. And it's a little disconcerting because the environment that I hailed from, that wasn't a common experience. I didn't live in a city while living in Boston. Boston kind of goes quiet after midnight, 01:00 in the morning. South Florida, where I came from, there wasn't really no city place that you went. Maybe Miami, but nobody really went to Miami. You stayed in the fun areas where you were near. It wasn't a city like Boston. Let's put it that way. And as I'm walking down the street, I see these people in various states of deep sleep or slowly waking. Get a little bit disconcerted. I didn't see any women. It was all men. And I started to get a little bit nervous, but I was by myself. So I had to figure out how to do this. And so I chose to walk down the middle of the street. It was interesting to me to see how I adapted when I put distance between me and that which was uncomfortable or discomforting. Putting that distance between me and the sidewalk by walking down the middle of the street. Yes, I had some fear that perhaps somebody would wake from their slumber and I don't know, verbally. I really didn't think so much physically, but just verbally. I'm not a confrontational person. So I have often thought about that when you put distance between yourself and that which makes you uncomfortable. Kind of avoidance. But yeah, there's my story.","I'm the first person out of four living generations to have left Mississippi. I didn't write when I was in Mississippi. I didn't perform. I didn't even know I had the capacity to do what I do now until I moved. I was never in an environment where that was encouraged or even understood. 

No one asked me my story, and that was problematic for me. I didn't feel connected in a way that other people felt connected in Mississippi. 

People describe me usually or often as an inspirational poet. My story helps other people tell their stories too. To me, that's the beauty of life. It's the people that you see. It's the stories that we tell. It's the stories that we remember, and it's how they affect us.",3,452,156
